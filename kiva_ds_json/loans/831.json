","en":"Saidmurod is married and a responsible father of four children.  He has been involved in growing agricultural crops for many years and has a very rich experience in this field.  Last year, large expenses on growing agricultural crops forced him to sell livestock in order to continue growing crops.

Now that the holy week is approaching and this is the season when fish consumption and avocado salad increases, Marybel and her husband take advantage and buy larger quantities and make greater sales than normal.  But her lack of working capital with which to invest in greater volumes is a big challenge, because the money is not enough to respond to increased customer demand.  This is why she\u2019s requesting a Kiva loan.  This is the first loan she\u2019s getting through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy avocados and fish.  Her investment will be successful because she\u2019s doing it at an appropriate time, when her demand and orders from her customers will increase.  She wants to satisfy them with fresh products at good prices."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1061436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fish and avocado.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-14T02:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-14T02:00:08Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marybel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":42037},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44885},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45932},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47004},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":48101},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49223},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50372},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51547},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52750},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":53981},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":55240},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58928}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.52,"local_amount":42037,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":43452.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651565,"comment":null},{"amount":26.18,"local_amount":44885,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46396.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141200,"comment":null},{"amount":26.79,"local_amount":45932,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:06Z","rounded_local_amount":47478.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101083,"comment":null},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":47004,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":48586.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338697,"comment":null},{"amount":28.06,"local_amount":48101,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":49720.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395262,"comment":null},{"amount":28.71,"local_amount":49223,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50880.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775067,"comment":null},{"amount":29.38,"local_amount":50372,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52067.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387054,"comment":null},{"amount":30.07,"local_amount":51547,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":53282.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993914,"comment":null},{"amount":30.77,"local_amount":52750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54525.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130274,"comment":null},{"amount":31.49,"local_amount":53981,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":55798.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519166,"comment":null},{"amount":66.61,"local_amount":114168,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":118011.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071008,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Rice farming is the primary source of income for her family to support their living. To earn more income, she plants some cassava on her 0.5 hectare of farmland. She has been in this business for 12 years. Currently, she can earn about US$3 per day from her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva's field partner, VisionFund, with her group of two female members. After successfully paying back the first loan, she could afford to buy a small plot of farmland for a plantation. Now she is leading her group to apply for another loan with VisionFund.

Working 7 days a week and 16 hours a day, he earns about 1,500,000 Sierra Leone leones (SLL) every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Unisa has already received and successfully repaid a loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy cigarettes, mayonnaise, sardines, milk, and soap.\n\nUnisa hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately  400,000 SLL. In the future, Unisa plans to own a house, to establish a larger business, and to travel to the holy land of Mecca.

asadas, pasabocas, empanadas, deditos y en general congelados. A este negocio se dedic\u00f3 con su c\u00f3nyuge una vez se independiz\u00f3 su c\u00f3nyuge de su anterior empleo y con ella dio curso libre a su negocio. Ellos con un molino el\u00e9ctrico, una estufa industrial, poncheras y latas, entre otras herramientas, desarrollan toda una operaci\u00f3n productiva: en las horas de la tarde empiezan el proceso de cocci\u00f3n del ma\u00edz, elaboraci\u00f3n de masas y armado de producto; se levantan muy temprano y a las 4:00 a.m. contin\u00faan  las tareas que el d\u00eda de ayer hab\u00edan dejado hecha en parte; asan las arepas, envuelven en bandejas y en pl\u00e1sticos transparentes y pasan directo al congelador. Sus principales clientes son colegios, cafeter\u00edas, empresas, tiendas y hospitales. Dunis tiene inmensos deseos de tener ingresos para lograr el bienestar de su familia por eso realiza una actividad simultanea que es la de elaborar piezas de hierro, negocio que desarrolla con su hermano. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr captar muchos mas clientes por eso est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1 ma\u00edz, queso, en mayor volumen envases desechables, para aumentar la producci\u00f3n de pasabocas, aprovechando que cada vez mas tienen nuevos pedidos y esto hace exitosa esta inversi\u00f3n. El mayor sue\u00f1o de Dunis es tener su propia casa y brindarle a su hija la mejor educaci\u00f3n que le sea posible, por eso se esfuerza con su c\u00f3nyuge para lograr estos prop\u00f3sitos.","en":"10 years ago Dunis met his spouse who worked in a family frozen food company and taught him everything that now they do together: make grilled, natural, corn arepas, snacks, empanadas, frozen fingers and frozen food in general. He dedicated himself to this business with his spouse once she quit her previous job and, with her, gave free rein to their business.With an electric grinder, an industrial stove, bowls and cans, among other tools, they developed a productive operation: in the afternoons they begin the process of baking the maize, making dough and product assembly. They get up very early and at 4AM conitnue their work that they had started the day before: grilling the arepas, wrapping in trays and in transparant plastic and going straight to the freezer.\r\n\r\nTheir main customers are high schools, cafeterias, companies, shops and hospitals. Dunis has immense wishes to have income to achieve the wellbeing of his family. For this, he performs a simulataneous activity, which is making iron pieces, a business that he is developing with his brother. His greatest challenge is to find more customers. For this, he is applying for a CrediKiva, the first loan that he's made with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will buy maize and cheese in greater volume in disposable containers to expand the production of snacks, increasingly taking advantage of new orders and this makes the investment successful. Dunis' greatest dream is to have his own house and to provide his daughter with the best education possible.

This is an area that scores low on development indices as it is in area where the main economic activity is cultivating the oil palm, an activity that predominantly employs men to harvest the fruit. This means that the women have few opportunities for paid employment. This is why Elsie works raising and fattening pigs - to help her partner with the household expenses. This loan, like the loans she had when she was a member of BM Laskmi, will be used to buy pigs, concentrate, and vaccines for the duration of the production cycle. She will make weekly repayments. Thanks to her work and the salary that her husband brings in (he is a teacher at a school that is on the border of Costa Rica and Panama) she has been able to send a son to the the University of Costa Rica to study business. He has a scholarship but it does not cover all of his expenses so he needs support from his parents to be able to complete his studies. Elsie also wants to support her daughter who wants to study culinary arts at the National Training Institute, an institution that teaches trades to build-up the labor market. Elsie and her husband are convinced that giving their children an education is the way to improve their quality of life.

They all live in the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of Mali) and know each other through familial, neighbourhood, and marital relations. The group members run small businesses selling fabric, pagnes (a type of brightly-printed West African clothing), ginger, rice, and plates. With the goal of increasing their capital, the group members joined Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first solidarity (group) loan cycle.\r\nMs. Ami (the woman all the way on the right in the photo) is one of the fabric and pagne retailers in the group. She intends to use her loan to buy ten sets of pagnes. She gets her supplies on the spot from wholesalers and sells her goods at retail, in cash and on credit, at home and at the market, to a clientele composed essentially of women. With this loan, Ms. Wassa intends to realize an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and to take care of certain household needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1070149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy pagnes (a type of brightly-printed West African clothing)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-04-14T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-14T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283252027,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411031,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449150,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502856,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502857,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":43576.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268514,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T14:58:41Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411328,"name":"Rosibel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nRosibel de 30 a\u00f1os de edad, habita junto a sus padres e hijos.

She starts work at 7am because in the morning she has more customers; she is able to return home at 8:30 pm with enough money to pay for her son's food. \r\n\r\nRight now she needs to reinforce and paint the base of the mototaxi so that it will be in better shape and she will be able to handle more customers and take them to farther destinations. With this support, she will be able to increase her income and her quality of life, which will motivate her more and help her to achieve her dream: \"improving her home and giving her greater

This is due to the fact that it is in these months, that the number of his customers increases because of the harvest season. In this way, he wishes to increase his income, and in time expand his business to start a freight transportation business, which he will do to improve his quality of life and that of his small son.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1060623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy plastic sheeting, baling material, and bag-closing thread, for covering and packaging agricultural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josue Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.27},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411595,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa en casa propia, tiene 02 hijos que mantiene. \u00c9l vive en la zona del Caser\u00edo Las Juntas en el distrito de Pacora y cuenta con servicios de  luz y agua en su domicilio.

Gulsah, when describing herself and her chosen profession, says \"'because I love playing with women's hair, I chose this profession. I started playing with my dolls' hair as a child and it awakened my curiosity.  I love my job.\"  \r\n\r\nShe has worked hard in order to be competent in her profession at such a young age.  After working with (being apprenticed to) a hairdresser for seven years, she completed her training. After meeting with Maya, Gulsah was able to start on her dream of opening a hairstyling business.  She named it Koko\u015f\u0131 (the closest translation is Chic).  Her work and her shop are incredibly beautiful because she opened it completely through her own efforts and labor.\r\n\r\nGulsah has been a Maya client for five credit cycles and has used the loans to refresh and develop her shop.  She has literally given her shop some of her own beauty and charm.  This is her sixth credit cycle with Maya and her first through Kiva. She will use this loan to buy materials and pay for labor so she can add a waxing room. This waxing room will enable to her expand her services. This is one more step towards her future dream of developing her business into a full service beauty salon. Gulsah is such a bright and ambitious young woman: it is easy to believe that she will be able to realize her future dreams. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Volunteers\r\n\r\n G\u00fcl\u015fah ,1991 Eski\u015fehir do\u011fumlu bekar 3 \u00e7ocuklu bir ailenin ortaca \u00e7ocu\u011fu .

As he grew, Chris learned to DJ by helping his father during events. Since then, Chris, 27, has learned new tricks, but he credits most of what he knows to his father\u2019s guidance. \r\n\r\nFor the past 10 years, he\u2019s worked as a DJ, but as of March 2012, he completed his first year as an entrepreneur with his San Antonio business: I.C.A.D.J. Entertainment. At some point, Chris hopes to hire more DJs, but at the moment, he is focused on doing his own work. \r\n\r\nAside from being a DJ, Chris works for Time Warner, sells travel packages for another company and, in his free time, assists other DJs. He said not being in only one field of work helps him be a better person. He decided to become an entrepreneur after he realized that he could grow monetarily while using his communication strengths to his advantage.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe unique thing about me, I don\u2019t require multiple DJs.\u201d he said. With him as the only DJ, Chris said, there is more room for personal time with the client or coordinator. \u201cIt allows me to give better value in price,\u201d Chris said, adding, \u201cI deliver value on all events.\u201d \r\n\r\nDuring events, Chris includes a variety of lights to give a club vibe. Chris said it doesn\u2019t matter how many lights a DJ has, what\u2019s important is what he does with them. \r\n\r\nPrior to contacting ACCION Texas Inc., Chris discussed the possibility of applying for a loan at Security Service Federal Credit Union. Afterwards, a SSFCU employee approached him and introduced ACCION to Chris.\r\n \r\nChris will use the loan to upgrade his equipment and repair his vehicle that transports him to events. His list includes a pair of 18\u201d Harbinger speakers for better sound, and lights, some of which are still working but are old, he said. He is also interested in purchasing laser lights. The rest of the loan will contribute to online marketing with the North Chamber of Commerce. \r\n\r\nChris said he is excited and looks forward to making good use of the loan and turning it into something better. \u201cMy goal is to improve annually,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big step for me.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1066816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

They will invest their loans in fruits and vegetables, ornamental plants, and material to do embroidery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1062173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase avocado trees and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Honoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":338.9,"local_amount":4280.88,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4327.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656830,"comment":null},{"amount":365.65,"local_amount":4618.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4668.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317503,"comment":null},{"amount":381.57,"local_amount":4819.84,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4872.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418888,"comment":null},{"amount":398.26,"local_amount":5030.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5085.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568466,"comment":null},{"amount":415.62,"local_amount":5249.95,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5307.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399793,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:01:18Z","paid_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":413234,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a pottery business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 12,000 through NWTF to buy materials needed for her pottery business.\r\n\r\nGemma has been in this business for two years.

She notes that she first began selling house to house in her neighborhood and then, a short time later, at a market nearby where she has a stall which she fought hard to obtain because there is a lot of red tape.\r\n\r\nLeo says that she adds to her inventory in the city of M\u00e9xico and in Morole\u00f3n, Guanajuato where they give her good prices. She notes hat she will use the loan to buy a greater variety of clothing and that the funding will help her because she will have a source of employment to support her children and she will be able to assist her husband with household expenses.\r\n\r\nLeo\u2019s goal is to increase her business more since she wants to have it very well stocked. She says that during this summer season she wants to buy cotton t-shirts, girl\u2019s pants and boy\u2019s bathing trunks. \r\n\r\nLeo states that she is very grateful to FRAC because, thanks to the loans they have provided, her business has grown, little by little.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Audelia, Josefina, Candelaria and Yolanda. They will invest their loans in their businesses consisting of hosiery  and haberdashery, a coffee bar, a grocery store, in napkins and cooking pots, in a combination of public service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1062168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
