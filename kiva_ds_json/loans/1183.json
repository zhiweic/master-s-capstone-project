In the community there are brigades of men who take care of the forests in order to maintain the village.  During summer vacation the children go off to the forests to collect \"ocoshal\" to sell to the community artisans.  In this way they help their parents cover household expenses and sometimes buy themselves sweets and refreshments.\r\n\r\nIrma has three children who are in elementary school.  She has an avocado field that she has been cultivating for two years.  The field does not produce avocados yet because the plants are small but in a year they should be ready.  She also makes ocoshal crafts that she sells to buyers who visit the community.  She would like to sell them in other cities to earn a little more and to make her beautiful pine palm crafts well known.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting loan through VisionFund to buy organic fertilizer called \"esti\u00e9rcol de borrego\"  (sheep manure) and insecticides to improve her cropland.  She will also buy material for her crafts such as thread in different colors, needles, chlorine, soap and a large tub to wash the ocoshal.  She says:  \"I am grateful to the lending institution for having confidence in me and for giving me loans to improve my businesses so I can give my children a better life.\"  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the Chibaty Group are Mar\u00eda Leucadia, Amelia and Mar\u00eda Crisanta.

Out of necessity and due to the difficult economic situation she has been in because of a lack of employment opportunities, she decided to go into business for herself to support her family.  She set up a small street vending business with a small hand-pulled artisan cart she uses to sell cakes, bagged water, lemonade, pastries, etc.   She started working all by herself and has been able to educate her small children and put food on the table.\r\n\r\nMarta is a hard-working, dedicated woman who goes out every afternoon after she does the housework.  She must distribute her time in such a way as to be able to attend to her children.  She constantly struggles against challenges and external obstacles that get in her way.  Problems such as civil disorder and climate change make her work more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is requesting a loan to buy a variety of goods (cakes, cookies, pastries, lemonade and bagged water) and change her artisan cart for a larger one.  This will allow her to have a wider variety of products to offer customers so she can increase her income.  Martha is hoping to get a stall through the city hall so she can improve her work conditions and attract more customers.  This would allow her to improve her family's lifestyle and give her children a better education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1404690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy goods (cakes, cookies, pastries, lemonade and bagged water) and to acquire a larger cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Rubiela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":52963},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":54416},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55908},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":57441},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":59016},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60634},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":62296},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":64005},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":65760},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67561}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.64,"local_amount":54718,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56017.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822350,"comment":null},{"amount":28.63,"local_amount":52854,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":54109.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807333,"comment":null},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":55856,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":57182.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095424,"comment":null},{"amount":236.47,"local_amount":436572,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":446941.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T19:17:18Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590276,"name":"Felisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felisa is 54 years old, married and has four children.

She is pictured with her hand raised and is the featured borrower member for \u201cJemhoi-Group\u201d. She has one son only and lives with her husband in a village which is about 45 kms away from the city capital of Imphal. Imphal is one of the capital states of the North-Eastern states of India. She has switched her business from growing and selling vegetables to running a variety shop in the village. Her husband also earns his living as a farmer. He ploughs others' fields and earns his daily wages. The family financial resources are entirely borne by Tingkhohoi and her husband. \r\n\r\nTingkhohoi runs a general store in the village. She sells only essential goods for the villagers which include detergent soaps, detergent powder, sachets of shampoo, different cereals, edible oils, loose as well as in pouches, candies, sweets, tea-leaves, sugar, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, etc. She usually gets her stocks from the city market and also from army canteen suppliers. She usually gets cosmetic items like hair-oil, face-cream, soap\/powdered soap from army canteen suppliers. The rates are subsidized as the supply is purchased from the army canteen at a cheaper rate as compared to the market rate. She sells only the basic needs or required items for the villagers as villagers are her sole customers.  \r\n\r\nTingkhohoi wants a loan to refill her general store with more cereals, imported rice, edible oils, etc. She aspires to supply the villagers on a credit basis in the future. She shared that, instant cash payment for goods by the buyers in the village is not easy. The villagers are managing their expenses with the meager income that they generate. If she can abundantly stock her store and be a supplier for the villagers, then the unnecessary spending on fares for transportation to purchase small items like soap or edible oil could be prevented and she will be able to make good sales, which will literally generate good income and will facilitate the villagers, too. \r\n\r\nShe thanked KIva and WSDS for the joint movement to facilitate women entrepreneurs. She and the other member wish them good-will and progress in their future works. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, poultry, and piggery.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1399424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase goods to refill the general store with cereals, imported rice, edible oils and kids'  delicacies to earn more profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T14:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T14:20:07Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkhohoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingkhohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T17:28:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592191,"name":"Lesly Xiomara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lesly es una mujer que la mayor parte de su vida se crio solo con su madre ya que su papa muri\u00f3 cuando ella era una ni\u00f1a y su madre con todo el sacrificio la saco adelante y logro que cursara la secundaria completa.

She has milk producing cows, chickens, and guinea pigs. She also grows crops on her land to harvest for their household consumption, with any surplus being sold. The money from this loan will be invested to purchase manure to improve her pastures, and feed for her animals. Her goal is to study cosmetology.

The city is renowned for its beautiful streets, green fields and colonial architecture. Its cuisine is varied and enjoyed by locals and foreigners alike. All of the members are friendly and helpful and they all strive for a better economic stability for their homes and families so they can make progress in life.\r\n\r\nPaztora has been one of the members of the Nuevos Senderos group for a few years. She lives in the centre of the city of Cuenca and she likes the credit group because it is supportive. She is 57 years old and is a widow. She has 4 adult children from her marriage who are working and help her out financially. She does not have her own house so lives in a rented place.\r\n\r\nPaztora has been earning a living for the last 25 years selling coffee, fruit juices, fruit salads and other products. She sells her products at a market in the city, working from one Sunday to the next without a fixed timetable. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy supplies for preparing her products and so keep her business going.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business, offer more products and eventually have her own stall for her sales.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2895.87,"image":{"id":1404747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcia Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Etelvina Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Paztora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daysi Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Blanca Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela Del Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3462.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":288.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":288.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":579.17,"local_amount":577.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":579.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815883,"comment":null},{"amount":579.18,"local_amount":577.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":579.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966094,"comment":null},{"amount":579.17,"local_amount":577.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":579.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857830,"comment":null},{"amount":579.17,"local_amount":577.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":579.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506199,"comment":null},{"amount":579.18,"local_amount":577.04,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":579.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729974,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T15:06:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590348,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is from Iraq.

Ebenezer Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maguguni group was formed in 2009 with an aim of joining efforts to rear chickens. Its members are mainly poultry farmers with only a few cows because their land area is small. They live in a rural area where there is no electricity and there is scarcity of fuel. Without a formal source of livelihood, the group members rely on poultry farming for a large percentage of their income. Some of the members rear layers while others specialize in broilers. On average,a tray of eggs sells for about $2.50, and a single member can produce up to four trays a day. A broiler chicken sells for approximately $3.80, with a single member rearing at least 100 chickens in a month. Money from these sales goes to cater for the chicken feed, payment of school fees as well as taking care of the other family needs.\n\nSolar lamps save on members' fuel costs, such as kerosene, which amounts to  approximately $16 a month. Improved stoves decreases firewood and charcoal usage, which costs a family about $9 a month. Members also find it necessary to use the efficient cook stoves in warming the poultry houses to keep their chicken warm and healthy. \n\nAfter receiving training on consumer education and financial management by Visionary Empowerment Programme, the members showed interest in solar lamps and improved cook stoves. Due to family responsibilities and economic constrains, however, they were unable to save upfront for the products and they opted instead to take loans. \n\nMary, the group's chair lady, has been using kerosene to light her house and poultry house, and she also uses charcoal to warm the poultry house. With the solar lamps, she no longer has to buy kerosene and charcoal and thus saves money. If she ploughs the amount she saves back to her poultry business, it will lead to growth and business expansion.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.83,"image":{"id":1400757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

This is Elizabeth, 43, a resident of Payatas, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Elizabeth's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams that her business will grow and expand and hopes to have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1401303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"  To pay for raw ingredients like rice, pork, chicken and vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":4333.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4692.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784481,"comment":null},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":3466.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3754.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771467,"comment":null},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":4333.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4692.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824509,"comment":null},{"amount":21.67,"local_amount":866.62,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":938.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-06T16:51:15Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T13:50:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592531,"name":"Mar\u00eda Andrea","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La cliente reside en el sector de Orqu\u00eddeas en Guayaquil.

She\u2019s requesting and hoping support from lenders to improve her health.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":269.03,"image":{"id":1404738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medicine, pay for tests, ultrasound and x-rays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":811.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1145.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1159.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1230.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1250.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1297.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1412.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1399.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1471.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1508.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1580.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1625.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1686.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1759.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1816.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1890.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1954.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.45,"local_amount":811.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":814.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399789141,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":1145.89,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065452,"comment":null},{"amount":46.39,"local_amount":1159.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1164.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829335,"comment":null},{"amount":82.67,"local_amount":2066.76,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2075.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430385106,"comment":null},{"amount":61.68,"local_amount":1541.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1548.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T03:10:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590377,"name":"Bartolomea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Bartolomea.

She found out about Milango through friends and she now seeks a loan to buy bales of secondhand clothes to sell. She has had previous loans from Milango which were not listed on Kiva and she paid them back without challenges. The challenge she faces in this business is price changes. Inflation also affects her income from the business and these are the challenges that she has to deal with. The extra income that she will raise from the loan use will help her pay school fees for her children. Her living standard will also improve.

Her specialty was going to be pediatrics because she always liked children.  Over time, Cristina has wanted to study different professions such as psychology, teaching, law and even to be a flight attendant, but she never forgot about her dream of being a doctor.\r\n\r\nIn her senior year of high school she was unsure about what to do because she would soon be leaving a time of friendships, partying and playing pranks, which she enjoyed so much, and going into the real world where one must struggle to get better things.  After graduation, Cristina starting looking into what she wanted to study but had forgotten her dream because many people said the degree required a lot more than simply wanting to be something.\r\n\r\nWith those simple words, Cristina abandoned her dream and started looking at other careers.  One day while talking to her brother he asked what had happened to her dream, because he remembered that Cristina used to play doctor with her dolls.  She said she could not study medicine because she did not have enough money.\r\n\r\nCristina's brother told her not to abandon her dream and to study to be a nurse auxiliary which would be a good line of work to go into so she could get into medicine professionally.\r\n\r\nCristina thought about it and decided to study to be a nursing auxiliary and after one semester she is thrilled.  She knows that when she finds a job at a hospital she will be able to pay for a nursing degree and after that she can pay for a medical degree and go into pediatrics.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most is learning about giving out medication, drawing blood, curing wounds and knowing that she can become a great doctor.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Cristina, an adolescent who always wanted to become a doctor and little by little, with effort and dedication will realize her dream of becoming the best pediatrician in order to provide for her family and make them proud of her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1385468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To continue her second semester of nursing in Campoalto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-08-06T20:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-05T20:30:09Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Yineth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":840000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":289124.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780594,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":144562.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410539971,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":144562.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420752498,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":289124.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439696775,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-06T22:49:30Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:12:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588473,"name":"Maryluz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maryluz tiene 33 a\u00f1os,  es una  mujer casada con dos hermosas hijas.

Her husband sells fodder (animal feed) in a nearby village.  Here most of the people keep cattle at their houses for getting milk, beef, and mutton, and also for pulling carts. Here there is a lot of demand for fodder from those people who keep cattle. His shop is situated in a poor society and most of his customers took fodder on a credit basis and do not pay their debts for many days. Now, his credit amount has gone out of limit and even he cannot buy fresh fodder to sell.\r\n\r\nNasreen is a poor lady and cannot sustain such kinds of irregularities in payments because fodder selling is only one way of getting income for her family. Therefore, Nasreen requested a loan of 30,000 PKR so that her husband would be able to buy fodder to sell.\r\n\r\nNow, her husband will avoid selling fodder on a credit basis and she hopes that this loan can easily fulfill the deficiencies.

","en":"Boobek is 42 years old, married and has three children.  His spouse is a homemaker and helps him with his work.  While searching for a source of income for his family in 2007, Boobek started farming and working with livestock.  He started his business with 10,000 KGS and today his monthly profits are 5,000 KGS.  In his care he has one dairy cow, one calf, and ten sheep.  He also has a plot of land, 2.10 hectares, where he grows mostly beans, peppers and vegetables.  Boobek also uses his own vehicle to offer taxi services which brings in a little income.  To further develop his business, Boobek turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy fertilizer and nitrates.  He plans to use the income from the loan to increase his herd and also to pay for his son's wedding.

","en":"Aminjon is 18 years old.  He is unmarried and lives with his parents. Aminjon studied well in school and actively participated in all extra-curricular activities of the school. He has finished school this year and is entered university. He enrolled at the National University of Tajikistan. Aminjon hopes that he will be a successful student at the university as well.

age 28, is married and lives in the village of Shilda with her family, husband and two children (6 and 7 years old). Ketevan\u2019s husband is the only one making money in his household working as a welder locally. The family lives in poverty and gets small social assistance from the local government. \r\n\r\nSeveral times, Ketevan has requested loans from local financial institutions in order to start up her clothing trading business but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected because of lack of experience in the business which is usually demanded by local financial institutions. Her loan request has now been approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions to country's vulnerable poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \"high-risk borrowers\" because of low income.

She became involved in animal husbandry in 1998, starting in this business with an initial capital of 12,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her back-breaking and capacious work, she has achieved some measure of success in her business and is now making a monthly profit of 10,000 som (KGS).\n\nSayrabu now owns three dairy cows and one horse. Her husband and her son help her run her business.\n\nEager to further develop her activity, Sayrabu has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" to request a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use her loan to buy one cow and one sheep.\n\nSayrabu plans to invest the earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock headcount. In the future, she would also like to buy a car.

They wanted to increase the variety and amount of goods they sell, so with the Kiva program, they ventured to borrow funds.\n\nReo is the leader of this group.

Alicia will use the 1,000 soles to buy organic manure to nourish her crops.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.85,"image":{"id":1405942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-07T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-06T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":103.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":117.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":121.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":133.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":139.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":146.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.66,"local_amount":103.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":108.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865138,"comment":null},{"amount":41.61,"local_amount":110.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":116.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353505,"comment":null},{"amount":43.99,"local_amount":117.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":122.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905268,"comment":null},{"amount":45.59,"local_amount":121.57,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091262,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T18:39:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590717,"name":"Analie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Analie works hard to support her family.

Amada feels happy and grateful to the institution for the support it has offered her, since this allows her to improve her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":1405959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes in bulk such as sweaters and jackets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2013-08-07T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-06T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Vania Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gianella Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Nardy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9400},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":7050},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1370},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1027.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1027.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1370,"local_amount":9400,"processed_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":9466.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410084860,"comment":null},{"amount":1027.5,"local_amount":7050,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7099.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419851386,"comment":null},{"amount":1027.5,"local_amount":7050,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T10:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7099.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430395391,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-14T15:51:29Z","paid_date":"2013-12-21T10:00:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":590720,"name":"Luciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciana is 67 years old and married with eight children.

This is a large but united family.  Angelina did not complete primary school because she did not have the necessary financial support from her parents.  Alongside her husband and children, she goes out to the country to look after and maintain her coffee crops, doing work such as fumigation, cleaning, putting down manure, harvesting and more.  Angelina is a enterprising and, so, saw a need to help her husband.  She decided to start a small grocery store in her home.  With it she can help generate an income to cover basic necessities for the family.  The land that Angelina works is her own.  It is located just a few metres from their home and so they arrive there by foot.\r\n\r\nAngelina needs to improve her crops, giving them more help and protecting them better, by using farming supplies that will make her product more attractive for her clients.

age 37, lives with her husband and children in Lahore. Her husband is very hard-working and loves his family very much, making every effort to make sure that his family's needs are fully met. \r\n\r\nTo earn income to support the family, Rubina's husband is involved in a manufacturing and furniture sales business, where he makes and sells such items as beds and tables. He started this business over 10 years ago. \r\n\r\nRubina herself stays at home and looks after her children. Because her children are still very young, they need constant care. She also takes care of her elderly parents.\r\n\r\nToday, Rubina's husband has many regular customers and also takes orders from other cities. This business yields a good income, but the family's needs are increasing day by day, and Rubina finds that she needs more money in order to afford household expenses. In order to remedy this problem, she would like to request a loan in order to buy more raw materials for her husband to use for making furniture, allowing him to expand the business. This is why she came to BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to obtain a loan of Rs. 45,000 so that her husband will be able to buy additional raw materials for making furniture. She is confident that this loan will prove beneficial and productive for his business as well as for the family.\r\n \r\nRubina offers her thanks to Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan for this invaluable support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213.88,"image":{"id":1402022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

She lives with her husband, Pedro, with whom she has seven children.  They took care of and educated them, but now only her youngest daughter lives with them in their own house.\r\n\r\nHer main work focuses on agriculture.  She comes from a farming family, so when she was a little girl she learned what was necessary to set up her own fields.  When she started her family she began to grow peas, potatoes, beans, and other food products for her household.  She says they rented farmland but, little by little, with the help of their savings, they bought pieces of land to add to what they had gotten from their parents.  This is how they currently have various plots of land where they grow in quantity.  \r\n\r\nShe says she sells her harvest in a nearby city where she gets a good price for her food and they're able to earn more profits.  Now she wants to improve the quality of her crops and save for her old age.
