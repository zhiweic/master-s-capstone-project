Rosa is a young woman who has been working selling articles of clothing in the town of Omaya for three years now. She tells us that before she started this business she supported her mother in selling groceries, where she gained business experience. For this reason she has no difficulties in serving customers.\r\n\r\nThe articles that she sells are acquired in the capital, Lima, where she has providers who supply her in accordance with the orders she may have. In the beginning she made her sales by going around to street fairs in her town or on Sundays in the market. Now she has a rented stall in the market where she offers her wares, but she still goes out to the nearby communities, taking her products to where her regular customers are.\r\n\r\nRosa is happy with this work that she carries out because it generates a good financial income thanks to the effort she puts into her daily sales. Going forward, she is thinking of continuing with the business that she has. This is her first loan through MFP, which is why she has committed to settling her repayments punctually.

She also takes advantage of her time to care for her animals which she takes uphill to pasture so that they can feed on green, natural grasses.  She has several head of sheep.  She relates that she fattens them up to then take to sell at higher prices in a well-known market in the zone.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cMaraypampa\u201d communal bank and this is her second MFP loan.  She feels happy because she found the help she so needed to start toward her objectives.  She is responsible in everything she does so promises to be punctual with her payments.  If Te\u00f3fila were to receive your support, she will use the requested money to buy natural fertilizer to spread among her corn and potato crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1054752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy natural fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-03T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-03T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2002.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451548,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-06T17:09:38Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411454,"name":"Copaboka 4 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur V\u00e9nuste, membre du groupe COPABOKA 4 est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 44 ans.

She tells us that the challenge she faces is that she does not have her own shop to be able to offer her products.  The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase more perfume and cleansers.  She also needs to find a location where she can sell her products.  This is a way she can generate more capital and earnings that will help her children with their education. She hopes to have the opportunity of receiving this loan and support for her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1027695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more perfume and cleansers.

With the help from this loan, she will also purchase necessary forage for the cattle.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Julieta to increase the income from agriculture and live with a higher quality of life.

Today Gulzat's business has one horse, five sheep, five goats and two cows bringing around 10,000 KGS monthly from the sale of milk and dairy products. The desire to save some money for her children's education pushed Gulzat to expand her business and open a food stall. With the goal to increase her working capital Gulzat has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 75,000 KGS which will let her expand the variety of products and acquire new customers. Gulzat plans to partially invest the income from the loan to buy building materials to build a shed for the livestock and partially into the growth of her retail

She lives in a house that is her own property.\r\n\r\nThe work Florinda does is selling bananas, for which she has equipped a table in the front part of her house and waits on her customers.  The majority of them are her own neighbors, whom she serves cordially and pleasantly, to gain their friendship.  She has been working in this job for more than three years, with a loan from MFP and having the help of her children in buying the product and waiting on the customers in their free time.  She considers her business worthwhile for the profits it gives her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job, which allows her to have an income with which to be able to help her partner with the household expenses, because she had to leave her job taking care of children because of her advanced age.  She hopes to be able to support her business and continue having her daily means of support, because she will not be able to find a job because of her age.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with the MFP institution.  She is contented and grateful for the opportunity given, which has meant a lot to her when she most needed it.  She wants to continue having this support and she will continue being punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nWith the requested total of 1200 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in buying bananas, looking for low prices for her bulk purchases, taking advantage of the fact that this product is scarce and the prices are on the rise.  In this way she will have greater profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1034707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":185.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":198},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":205.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.82,"local_amount":367.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":367.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714101,"comment":null},{"amount":74.25,"local_amount":198,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":198.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203000,"comment":null},{"amount":77.02,"local_amount":205.39,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":205.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098670,"comment":null},{"amount":78.36,"local_amount":208.97,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":208.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401515,"comment":null},{"amount":82.55,"local_amount":220.13,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":220.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455813,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is happy and sociable and she enjoys business.  She is living with Biviano, who makes a living in transportation, and who is the father of her three children:  Leydi (8), Julio (4) and Greysi (1).  All of them live comfortably in their own house, which she worked hard to purchase with her father-in-law.  \r\n\r\nThe work that Gisela does is rent internet stations.  She has five well-installed computers, which are very busy since it\u2019s the only business of its kind in the area.  It is located in a spot in her own house that is in good condition, and she does a good job of taking care of her customers.  She launched this business over a year ago, starting with three machines with her own capital. Later, due to demand, she acquired two computers, which resulted in growing her business a little more.  Over time, she has become very well-known.  \r\n\r\nFor this activity she relies on the support of her spouse, who supports her in his spare time, and during the mornings she attends to the business.  She enjoys her work, which allows her to earn regular income to support her family and to be able to pay for her childrens\u2019 studies, which fills her with pride.  In addition, she supports her spouse with expenses.  \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of demand for her business, and even more during peak hours, since there is a shortage of computers and her place is filled with users who are mostly from her area.  For that reason, she would like to grow and increase her business.  \r\n\r\nShe is also in the process of opening a new business - a poultry shop - which she is installing next to the internet stations.  Right now she is awaiting the arrival of the oven and the shop's opening in just two weeks, which will generate more income.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan number 3 with the institution MPF.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on this financial support to develop her business, so she is committed to being responsible with the repayment of her loans, like she was with the previous credit.\r\n\r\nWith the loan which she has applied for 3500 nuevos soles (monetary denomination for Peru),  she will buy computer keyboards, mice, internet cables and other accessories for computers, since she tells us that due to the constant use of the current ones, they are worn out.  She will also invest the balance in the purchase of tables, chairs and utensils for the new poultry shop business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1020202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To buy computer mice, keyboards and other accessories for the PC, as well as utensils to launch her poultry shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-04T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-04T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":221.99},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":240.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":278.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":295.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":309.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":320.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":334.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":347.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":356.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175.15,"local_amount":462.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":468.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714061,"comment":null},{"amount":96.44,"local_amount":254.76,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":257.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098632,"comment":null},{"amount":202.95,"local_amount":536.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":542.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401475,"comment":null},{"amount":107.26,"local_amount":283.34,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":286.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446634,"comment":null},{"amount":743.2,"local_amount":1963.17,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1987.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869247,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-08T22:54:42Z","paid_date":"2013-04-19T09:22:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400161,"name":"Edson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edson, de 28 a\u00f1os, es un hombre honesto, trabajador y responsable, es soltero y no tiene hijos, vive en casa de sus padres. \u00c9l trabaja mucho pues desea brindar lo mejor a sus padres a quienes apoya en los gastos del hogar.

What he does not like is the rain because it makes selling his products difficult.  He depends on the climate as far as sales are concerned, but this does not affect his plans to increase beverage product variety and set up a company where he can be a prosperous business owner.  \r\n\r\nThis is his third loan through MFP and he is hoping a small loan will help him meet his goals.

She lives with Juan Carlos, her husband of one year. They have a small son who's 4 months old and whom they love very much. His name is Carlos Cruz. For now they live in the home of her mother, located in La Florida. When she began to work with the association she was a young worker who fought to get her mother and siblings ahead. Now that she has her own family she plans on doing the same together with her son and husband. She makes a living selling beauty products of a brand that's well-known on the global level. She does this by means of catalogs where her clients see what they like and then make their orders. During this time she was able to obtain products in stock and because of this she already has a secure financial capital. But the most profitable financial activity is centered around raising chicken, which she sells together with her mother to a well-known restaurant in the city. She says that she and her mother are planning on setting up a very large space that she has in her home where they can raise more chicken and in this way supply the orders they have. She is already planning strategies to make this project a reality. She belongs to the solidarity group \"Tambo al progreso\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very thankful for all the people who make the money possible as it allows many people like her to get ahead. After receiving support, Jakeline will invest the requested money in the purchase of 400 small chicken to begin her project."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1036755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

They rented a booth in a city market, where they trade in men's clothing.\r\n\r\nAstghik wants to refresh their clothing selection for the coming spring\/summer season. For this reason she has applied for this loan to purchase clothing. This loan will help Astghik to increase sales and develop her business, which means increased income for Astghik and her family.

She graduated from a university with the Kyrgyz-language and literature teaching degree and currently works as an assistant director of the school in the Namatbek village.  Kulbara has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 1994, having started this business with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  At the present time, her business yields about 11,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and milk products.  Also, Kulbara works on 4.40 hectares of irrigated land, where she grows potatoes, beans and apples.  In order to further develop her business, Kulbara requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into expanding her business.

They live together in their own home, located in the village of Yanama Alto, in the district of Palca-Tarma.  \r\n\r\nSince becoming a mother, Maximiliana has been working in agriculture.  Alongside Miguel, she grows peas, potatoes and root vegetables.  She admits that her work is very tiring, which is why they hire workers during harvest time to speed along the work.  She sells all her production in the wholesale market in Tamba.  She also raises animals such as sheep, guinea-pigs, bulls and two cows who provide her with milk with which she makes cheese to sell.  \"Selling cheese alone, I earn 5 to 10 soles a day\", she says.  For this reason, she is thinking about acquiring more cows to improve her cheese production.\r\n\r\nMaxmiliana is a visionary woman.

They have 5 children, but only two of them live with them: Jos\u00e9, who is 20, and Jean Carlos, who is 12. They own their own home in the town of  Palcamayo \u2013 Tarma. From childhood she was taught how to work the land and obtain products from it; therefore she successfully plants peas, spinach, and carrots in her three plots. She is very intelligent and knows the times when sales are the best. She travels frequently to Lima to sell her vegetables wholesale. One of her main problems is the freezes and pests that destroy her plantings. \u201cThe years aren't spent in vain because I know how to combat these problems, but it takes a lot of investment,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nShe also sells at retail since vegetable sales are good in the capital, and she goes there 3 times a week.  All this work is done with the help of her inseparable husband Ad\u00e1n, to whom she is grateful for his affection and companionship.  She asserts that all this effort is worth it, since her sons work and 20-year-old Jos\u00e9 is studying to become a professional. She is very proud. This will be the 11th loan she has received from MFP. She promises to make her payments promptly as she has done in the past. She is proud to belong, as one of its oldest members, to the communal bank \u201cPatr\u00f3n San Crist\u00f3bal.\u201d Armanda will be able to buy a sack of peas and a can of spinach seeds and successfully start her planting in July.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1037157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She lives with her daughter, 21 year old Katy, in a home of her own, located in Palcamayo \u2013 Tarma.  Celia is a very communicative woman.  She tells us that she has had to endure much work in order to be able to have what she has.  As a girl, she would help her parents with the farming and the livestock.  She later began baking bread, cakes, and other foods and she worked in a bakery for more than 10 years.  Through all of her efforts she was able to save enough money to buy land of her own, where she raises peas, potatoes, beans, and spices.  She would take her products to the country\u2019s central jungle, so she built her house there, but since she lives in Tarma, she rents out the rooms to other people, which brings her income.  At the moment she has a grocery store that she runs out of her home.  This is how she got started buying and selling land.  She says, \u201cSales are sporadic, so my store helps me a lot.\u201d\r\n\r\nCelia is seeing her goals come true, now that her daughter has completed her higher education and will be able to support herself with no problem.

Another activity that produces benefits for her is raising livestock.  \r\n\r\nShe tills the land with help from her two bullocks and she sells the milk her cows produce and also makes cheese with it. In addition, she opened a grocery and basic staples store at home a year ago.  She comments that she does very well in all her activities.\r\n\r\nYanama is a settlement with scarce transportation which makes transportation and sale of her products difficult which is why she wants to save up what\u2019s necessary to buy a vehicle to be able to transport her products more easily.\r\n\r\nThis would be loan #7 received from MFP and she hopes for support from all of you so that she can continue toward her objectives.

She lives in her own house with her three beloved children.  She wishes to give them a good education and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a very hard-working woman who always does the following like a routine.  In the mornings she gets up very early to go to her land where she grows crops.  In ten years she managed to get the land in order to benefit her family.\r\n\r\nShe is always up to date on the expenses that affect her children, most of all during the school season.  That is why she is always up to date with the production of her cocoa and coconut plants.  She takes her harvest to sell to the storage warehouses.  They pay her good earnings for each kilo.  With her income from the harvests she manages to pay her children\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is why she comes to the MFP offices to request a loan to help complete her work plans.

She is in a common-law marriage with Jes\u00fas, who works for a company and is the father of their 3 children.  The oldest is already independent and doesn't live with her.  She lives with Jes\u00fas and their 2 youngest children:  Mary, 25, and Jes\u00fas, 14.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Estela has a business selling soft drinks.  She has a refrigerator that she bought with Jes\u00fas' help, and they put it in their home, where she attends to her customers.  She has run this business for more than 1 year.  Seeing that their home was lacking financially, she started the business because of Jes\u00fas' idea.  He advised her to start it, observing that it was in demand because of the hot climate in the area.  She decided to continue with it.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it lets her have an economic income to support Jes\u00fas with their home's expenses.  It also lets her be at home so she can care for and attend to her children, whom she loves very much and of whom she wants to take good care.  They are her motivation to keep working hard.  Her plan now is to expand her business and open a restaurant in her home since Jes\u00fas knows how to cook, and she thinks it is a good area for this type of business.  This will be her fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She hopes that through it, she will be able to continue with her goals.  She promises to make all of her payments on time like she has with her previous loans.  In this way, she will have access to more loans in the future.

He is also happy and friendly.  He is in a common-law marriage with Elsa, who is a merchant and the mother of their 2 children:  Jorge, 2, and Sayaza, 6 months.  He lives with Elsa and their children, whom he loves very much, in their own home.  They are his motivation.  Benito sells various fruits, which he buys in the capital.  Sometimes a supplier sends them to him.  He takes them to sell to towns and settlements located on the edges of the city.  For this, he has a tricycle equipped with an amplifier.  He has done this work for more than 6 months and has the help of Elsa, who sells from their home.  In this way, they are able to sell all of their products and have better turnover of their inventory.\r\n\r\nHe likes his work because it keeps him busy.  He decided to do it because he needed a business that would let him have an economic income to pay for his home's expenses and his children's education and that would let him manage his own work schedule.  On the other hand, it bothers him when he doesn't sell enough to cover his home's expenses, which happens sometimes due to the constant rains.  But this doesn't discourage him, and he keeps working.  He has plans to continue with his business.  This will be his second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He hopes that through it, he can continue with his goals.  He promises to make his payments on time like he did with his previous loan.  With the requested amount of 1,500 PEN, he will invest in the wholesale purchase of a variety of fruits that he will get in the capital to stock his business.  He will look for good prices for his high-volume

He is also happy and friendly. He is single, doesn't have any children and lives comfortably with his parents and his three siblings: Deysi, 29; Yen, 22; and Aron, 19. Kenny makes a living transporting passengers with an automobile he purchased with his savings when a low-cost opportunity presented itself two years ago. He gets up very early in search of customers on the city streets, works until he takes a mid-day break, and then dedicates himself to technical school in the afternoon. He considers his work lucrative because of the good profits he makes. He enjoys the activity because he can manage his free time and focus on his studies. He says that he decided on this work out of the need to earn income because he had a lot of needs that he couldn't afford. Now he feels more calm and comfortable because he has steady income and more free time. However, he tells us that it bothers him a bit when it rains a lot because it makes it difficult to work, but it doesn't discourage him. He plans to finish his higher education and start his own transportation company. This will be his second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he hopes your collaboration will help solidify his plans.

Among her six children, three of them are married, two are still studying and the youngest is still an infant.\r\n\r\nZoraida has operated her store for two years. She is grateful because she is able to earn about P3,000 a month. She uses her income to buy the feed supplies for her raised hogs, for her children's allowances and for their daily needs. However, the income intended for re-stocking her store is no longer enough.\r\n\r\nBecause of this situation, she is requesting a loan amount of P10,000, which will allow her to buy more merchandise. This would mean a lot of her, most especially in sustaining her family's needs and maintaining her store.

is a determined young man of 25 who has been running his money transfer business since July 2011. He wants to use his loan money to purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can serve his customers faster. He also wishes to use the money to increase his working capital. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called champion agents. Bright is one of the champion agents. This is his story. \r\n\r\nWhen Bright first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 48 transactions a day. Because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shop and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBright is currently living with his grandmother, who is taking care of five other people. He continues to work extra hard so that he can be able to move out of his grandmother's house and get his own place. In the next five years, Bright sees himself as a full blown businessman. He plans to open money transfer shops in two new locations. \r\n\r\nIn Bright's video, the interview is conducted by a representative of Mobile Transactions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":944547,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2515,"youtubeId":"dS62-5HpqD8","title":"Kiva
