According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGulo requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor. They do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers,\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Gulo will buy and sell bed-clothing. She plans to go to Turkey and buy bed-clothing from the wholesalers and then resale at higher price among her villagers. This will increase the income of the family.

She shares a married life with Edgar, who is thirty-one years old, and they have the happiness of possessing three great motives in life: their three children, Jhon, Maicol, and Enrique.  They live together as a family in a home made of adobe, which they acquired a little after they married.  \r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Flora has participated in the production of cacao and organic coffee, together with her parents.  Years after all this vast experience, she had enough knowledge to start herself, and together with Edgar, they fought to get ahead with a plot of land inherited from her parents.  This is the main source of livelihood for the family.\r\n\r\nAs the years pass and the children grow up, she remembers very well when she began the construction of her home; years later, they have noticed that the roof needs to be repaired as soon as possible in order to avoid the constant leaks that occur in the rainy season.  In making this repair, they hope to offer their children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to begin to construct her home from cement and bricks; she feels certain that she will succeed in doing this, as long as she always has the motivation to work and move forward.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She feels very happy to be receiving a loan and promises to be a member who is very punctual with her loan payments.  \r\n\r\nShe wishes to have 500 soles in order to buy corrugated metal sheets so that she can continue with the repairs to the roof of her home and avoid leaks.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1293882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy corrugated metal sheets in order to proceed with the repairs to the roof of her home.

She shares a married life with 30 year old Carlos.  Her main source of motivation is her little seven year old Anderson and one year old Yerenin.  She lives with her family in an adobe home.  Ever since she was a young woman she has always worked in farming activities related to coffee and organic cacao.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, with the intention of giving her little Anderson more attention, she chose to open a grocery store, together with Carlos, on the first floor of her house.  She has been in the business for three years.  So far she has managed to develop it into a good additional financial support for her family.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is peaceful yet entertaining work.  This has allowed her to become very well-known and dear to her neighborhood.  However, the rise in prices for the products many times decreases her sales.\r\n\r\nHer long term plans are to start building her house out of substantial material.  She hopes to do so to benefit her two little ones.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.

Razia is a 44-year-old married woman. She has been manufacturing buckles for the past eight years which are used in the embellishment of shoes. She makes beautiful buckles at home and then sells them in the local market.  At this time she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income. Her husband works as a laborer and earns insufficient income to support his family alone. \r\n\r\nShe is a mother of three children and is motivated to provide for her family.

Ciudad que aun conservando espacios verdes, forma parte de la zona urbana de la ciudad. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo con 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, que pretenden aprovechar cada oportunidad para ser el sustento de sus pobladores. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os como es el caso de Segundo, un joven que con 24 a\u00f1os de edad ha forjado su camino para salir adelante, \u00e9l termin\u00f3 la escuela primaria y es por esto que tuvo dificultades en conseguir empleo.

Aprendi\u00f3 con el ejemplo de sus padres quienes siempre esforzados, hicieron esta labor para sacar adelante su familia y tener cada d\u00eda la cobertura de sus necesidades. Cada d\u00eda invierte 10 horas en el cuidado de los cultivos y de los animales, adem\u00e1s del aseo de los criaderos y la venta de sus productos. Este hombre sin duda emprendedor, quiere que su negocio crezca y as\u00ed darse a conocer en toda la zona, para lo cual ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de cerdos beb\u00e9s para poder continuar con su negocio, pues tiene que reemplazar los que se han vendido y adem\u00e1s dar un paso de crecimiento al negocio aumentando los criaderos para as\u00ed ofertar m\u00e1s animales.

","en":"Pastaza is located in the center of the ecuadorian highlands, near the rainforest and in the middle of the countryside. This canton belongs to the province of the same name, which belongs to the Republic of Ecuador's amazonic region. It is an urban area, but the town still preserves its green areas. The city of Puyo is the largest in the canton, located 924 meters above sea level. It is demographically small, but there is a great variety of sites which are preferred tourist destinations for domestic and international visitors, especially those related to ecological activities and extreme sports. The city's economy is growing daily, due to commercial activity, ranching, farming, and tourism. Every opportunity is seized for these activities to support its inhabitants. In every business there are people who have not given up in the face of unemployment and have started their own business ventures in order to earn a decent living and make their dreams come true. \r\n\r\nThat is the case of Segundo, a young man who at the age of 24 has made a way for himself in order to get ahead. After he finished primary school, he had difficulty finding work, so four years ago, he adapted his land to the production of sugarcane and the raising of pigs to sell. He learned from his parents' example. They always worked hard in this business in order to raise their family and cover their daily needs. Segundo is single, and has high expectations for his future.\r\n\r\nHe is undoubtedly an enterprising man. He invests ten hours per day in tending to his crops and animals, as well as in cleaning up the pigsties and selling his products. He wants his business to grow so that he can become known in his whole area, which is why he has requested a loan. He will use it to purchase baby pigs so that he can continue with his business, because he must replace the ones that are sold. He will also take another step towards expanding his business, which is to increase his pigsties so that he can offer more animals. Segundo has had a hard time obtaining capital from financial institutions, so he is grateful to Kiva for intervening so that people all over the world are able to live their dreams.

is 35 years old, and he lives in Kutaisi district with his wife, parents-in-law and four-year-old daughter. Zaza works as a baker at the local bakery, and his father-in-law is an operator at the petrol station. Both of them earn a monthly salary. \r\n\r\nZaza has asked for a loan from local financial institutions several times to start up a family business, but he hasn't had any success. He wants to start his own bakery, but his loan requests have always been rejected in the past because of his lack of experience, which is usually required by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nZaza has now been approved for a loan by a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program is designed to provide business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to traditional credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Zaza plans to start his own bakery. He will bake traditional Georgian bread and sell it for a good price. He hopes his project will be profitable as he already has good baking experience, and will offer quality products to his customers. He thinks this will increase his sales volume. The new business, financed by the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his

With this loan, she hopes to make an average monthly profit of 45,000 francs CFA, which she will reinvest in her business and also use to help her husband with certain family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1293674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy wax pagne-style cloth and damask.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-02-13T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-15T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astan               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347180096,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922909,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636457,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029941,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":80511.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T22:34:23Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526860,"name":"Pascasie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascasie is 27 years old.

He hopes that his profits from the 2013 Long Rains season can be used to send his children to school and repair his home. For the 2013 Long Rains season, David\u2019s group members will take input loans of \u00bd acre each. In total, this group will receive input loans for use on 5 acres of land.

Her family works in farming, planting and growing coffee 15 minutes from her house and transporting it on foot every day.  As they are in school, her children help their parents with the fieldwork on the weekends and they help care for their brother daily.  When she was a child, Mar\u00eda Magdalena was not able to go to school for financial reasons, as her parents have few economic means.  Because she was not able to attend even a year of school, she had to work hard since she was very young.  Mar\u00eda has a small grocery store in her house that generates income and helps with the expenses that come up at home every day, such as clothing, restrictive medications, food, and the purchase of products to sell.  However, she puts a lot of effort into tending her shop and caring for her son while her other children are at school and her husband is out in the fields.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena is currently asking for help to clean, plant, and maintain their crop, as there is a disease (rust) that is going around that affects coffee plants and they lost part of their crop.  However, with the loan she will be able to plant a more resistant varietal.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to pay off her loan with the earnings from her harvest and to have enough to buy the medications her son with hydrocephalus needs.  However, her dream is to see her children graduate and find professions that give them good employment opportunities and a better way of life and for them to be respectable men and women."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.6,"image":{"id":1291512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to clean, plant, and maintain her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"san nicolas, santa barbara","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-13T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-15T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.6,"local_amount":11.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364498808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T17:55:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526846,"name":"Kaliko","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kaliko is a farmer who grows grows sugarcane, cabbage, and bananas.

","en":"Isabel sells cold meats but she has also added selling stainless steel and silver jewelry to her first business. She has been able to see her family advance in life thanks to this economic activity. She has two children with her partner, ages 8 and 13. Her business idea was born out of the necessity to generate her own income, in particular to help care for her children who, as they grow, have many more needs that require more money. Her husband, who works as a contractor for a business in the area, was the one who motivated her to get started. Her principal customers are her neighbors in the area who complement their good looks with the accessories that Isabel sells. In the same market, she also sells sausages like Butifarra (Catalan style sausage), salchichas (sausage), salchich\u00f3n (a salami-like sausage), among other kinds of meats she purchases in the city market, which helps her to generate new sources of income that makes her life, and that of her family, that much better. She is currently applying for a loan with kiva and her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

They have three children, but only one lives with them. Their home is located in a rural district in Peru. With a lot of enthusiasm, Yolanda mentions that her main source of income for the past 20 years has been farming, and through her work she was able to pay for the higher education of her children, who visit her often. She is happy to have the love of her grandchildren, whom she admittedly spoils a lot. Her main crops are gladiolus flowers, peas and potatoes, and she vigorously cares for them because she depends on good sales every harvest. She sells the products in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, and, depending on the quality, she takes them to Lima, the capital, where they pay better prices. \"Planting peas and gladiolus is very lucrative. The good thing is that they are harvested in four to six months,\" Yolanda says. The plantings never stop in her area, so she needs your help to acquire more seeds and bags of fertilizers. Yolanda belongs to \"Picaflores de Patay\" community bank, and this is her eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP. She hopes with all of your support she can continue with her objectives. She plans to purchase five bags of pea seeds and two of gladiolus seeds, and the rest will go toward bags of fertilizers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1293963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase pea seeds, gladiolus flowers seeds and bags of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-14T02:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-16T02:00:14Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1550,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4005.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996299,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T23:03:22Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":527381,"name":"Liz Narcisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Liz compr\u00f3 materias primas con los cuales confeccion\u00f3 uniformes escolares, respondiendo a la demanda de estos productos.

With the hard work and persistence she is known for, Margot makes a living growing peas and gladiolus flowers, which has delivered good results ever since her first years in farming when she was a young woman. \"Normally I plant a bag and half of pea seeds, which produces 40 sacks,\" she says. She grows the gladiolus herself, and buyers visit from other farms to negotiate the sales. She says the business is lucrative because the buyers make their purchases right there and then take them to other cities to resell. In this way Margot earns an income that allows her to educate her children and cover expenses. These days of rain will be a big help for planting peas and gladiolus, which is why she is requesting your help. This will be her ninth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she promises to make her payments on time. She belongs to \u201cLos Picaflores de Patay\u201d community bank and is a responsible member.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilia operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, ranging from round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats, but also offers other crafts that most rug-makers come across every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabrics, threads and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLilia dreams of expanding her business further and hopes that her business will grow even more. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 49 years old. She is married and raising two children. Muhabbat and her family live in a rural area and are engaged in growing crops. They have 1.5 hectares of land. Income from the business is not enough to improve their living conditions. All the members of the famly, Muhabbat's husband and children, are involved in this business. \r\n\r\nMuhabbat decided to start a new business to generate additional income.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nCeferina hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a peaceful life. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1293549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She has been working at a private business entity since 2002 and, in 2007, she began working as a bookkeeper. Her husband has been working as a driver at the same entity since 2001. Her daughter was employed as a field manager in 2012. Even though the family owns a house on their own land, they live in a traditional Mongolian ger (portable felt tent).

is Lolita, 48, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is already a widow and a mother to her child. She manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLolita operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLolita hopes to have another branch and dreams of having another vehicle. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1293570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for

is from the small town of Khashuri. She is 40 years old, married, and lives with her husband and two children (21 and 16 years old). Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually a requirement for the local credit providers. Irma\u2019s business is a small canteen at the local school, where she sells cheese pies, juices and different kinds of snacks among students.\r\n Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Irma will purchase clothing and bed clothing at wholesale prices and resell them in her town and nearby villages for a profit. It will be hard work for Irma, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":528.02,"image":{"id":1293606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to start up a trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Khashuri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-02-14T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-16T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":60.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.66,"local_amount":49.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":49.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861384,"comment":null},{"amount":47.65,"local_amount":47.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":47.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570188,"comment":null},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":49.38,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":49.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968821,"comment":null},{"amount":50.21,"local_amount":50.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749240,"comment":null},{"amount":51.92,"local_amount":51.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":51.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613146,"comment":null},{"amount":52.9,"local_amount":52.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856873,"comment":null},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":54.29,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":54.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133536,"comment":null},{"amount":55.97,"local_amount":55.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":55.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107141,"comment":null},{"amount":57.19,"local_amount":57.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":57.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254716,"comment":null},{"amount":58.85,"local_amount":58.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":58.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018895,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-15T17:06:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":527136,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelina is a 59-years-old, married woman with two children.

is a single man aged 26. He is a repeat client and on his second loan. His first loan was of 1,000,000 Uganda Shillings (UGX) which he serviced well.\r\n\r\nDenis did not continue with his education after finishing form four because his parents didn't have money to fund his tuition. So he had to look for businesses in order to provide for his family. He went to a driving school so that he could learn driving, and later on he got into the taxi business because there was a demand by the Sudanese and other business people who wished to offer him a job. He uses the income to pay rent and look after his brother's sons (dependents), saving the balance with Ugafode Micro-finance Ltd.\r\n\r\nWith the savings, the bought a piece of land for 1,500,000 Uganda Shillings (UGX) which he used to save on his account.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Augustina's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 5000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAugustina hopes that her business will grow bigger and dreams of having a good life with her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She's also going to expand her bookstore because she sells other products (sweets, ice cream, gifts for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, etc.).\r\n\r\nHer long-term goal is to buy a photocopier and a computer to use in her business because she doesn't have these resources and her customers request them frequently.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1294762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy furniture for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Antigua Guatemala,Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2013-02-14T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-16T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Priscila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":416.63},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.5,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":458.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356489364,"comment":null},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":463.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":472.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364515714,"comment":null},{"amount":60.87,"local_amount":468.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":477.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373129852,"comment":null},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":416.81,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":425.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381935148,"comment":null},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":453.96,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":462.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390798671,"comment":null},{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":431.05,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":439.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399810270,"comment":null},{"amount":55.7,"local_amount":428.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":436.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410086327,"comment":null},{"amount":56.8,"local_amount":436.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":445.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419852745,"comment":null},{"amount":188.64,"local_amount":1451.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429501560,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T20:14:38Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T15:24:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":527173,"name":"Rosiel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rosiel, 29, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

engaged to 34-year-old Efrain. She has a great source of motivation, which is her little one-year-old Ariana. She lives with her small family in a rented house built with noble materials. She used to help her mother sell food at a local fair. Years later, when her relationship with Efrain became official, thanks to some savings they successfully opened a beauty salon in a rented space located within the central area of her town. Thanks to the skills she learned from an accelerated hairdressing class, she's able to use her business to solidly contribute to her family's finances. She reports that she enjoys her work very much, because during this time of the year the influx of customers is very good. For that reason she wishes to have enough capital to purchase beauty supplies and provide hair dyeing as well as other services that are requested by her customers.\r\nHer long-term goal is to earn enough money to purchase a plot of land.

18-year-old young woman without familial responsibilities who has gone out on her own. She has an adobe home that her parents gave her. After finishing high school she couldn't afford to attend college outside of town, and that's when her mother gave her the idea to make a living selling clothes. It is a very interactive business, which allows Jaki to meet a lot of friends and at the same time grow as a person, though the rainy season is a huge inconvenience for carrying out her work around town. She prefers to go out on weekends with clothes like pants and blouses that she picks out personally. She's on her second batch of clothes to sell, and she plans to use your support to increase her merchandise. She wants to have steady work, with the goal to go to college for a business administration degree and fulfill a dream she has had since she was a little girl. This is her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she feels very content and at the same time grateful for the opportunity you are providing. She hopes to make her payments on time. She is requesting the loan to purchase blouses, pants and shirts to sell in the coming days."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1294777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase blouses, pants and shirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T03:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T03:10:11Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":108.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117.11},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":114.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":124.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":124.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":132.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":137.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":140.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":108.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-19T08:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":112.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347123095,"comment":null},{"amount":46.84,"local_amount":117.11,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":121.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868937,"comment":null},{"amount":45.79,"local_amount":114.47,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":118.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577778,"comment":null},{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":124.73,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530009,"comment":null},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":124.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":128.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975039,"comment":null},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":132.93,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":137.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996308,"comment":null},{"amount":54.92,"local_amount":137.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":141.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863830,"comment":null},{"amount":56.15,"local_amount":140.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":145.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352290,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T00:14:07Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:01:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":527197,"name":"Chantal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chantal is 28 years old.

The seventeen members of his group, eleven women and six men, are farmers in Kakamega South District. For the 2013 Long Rains planting season, David\u2019s group members will each receive loans to support planting one-half acre of land. This works out to a group loan sustaining eight and a half acres of land.\r\n<p>\r\nDavid joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains of 2012 so that he could grow enough food for his family and use his increase in profits to send his children to school.

Unfortunately, some time ago Justo lost his beloved wife, and since then he is the pillar who works to keep his family together. Justo is very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic. He was not able to study a professional career - he would have chosen Civil Engineering - but he would have very much liked to have done so. In his free time he likes to listen to music and sometimes cooks a delicious roasted chicken to share with his family.\r\n\r\nBy his own initiative, and with a lot of tenacity and dedication, Justo works in the field of construction. He is a master builder and works about 8 hours a day. He is happy doing his work and thinks that it goes well because of his good finished products.\r\n\r\nJusto is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he will be able to buy a computer which will help his younger children as a tool for their studies.

The group has nine women and one man. Beatrice is on the right side of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her on credit, consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd an acre of maize, millet and sorghum. \r\n\r\nBeatrice joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains in 2008, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. She joined One Acre Fund so that she could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer and learn good farming techniques. Prior to joining, Beatrice was only able to harvest three bags of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, she was able to harvest six bags per acre.

After separating from her husband she had to look for a means of survival to support her six children.  Without any capital, she opted to go to the landing site, where she  could access fish from the fishermen on credit and then pay after selling them. \r\n\r\nWhen she learnt of the Ugafode group from a friend at the same site she found it was wise to join since she would be able to get more fish with the loan money and therefore increase her sales.
