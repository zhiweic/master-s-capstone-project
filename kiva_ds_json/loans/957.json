Amina is a 27-year-old married mother of two who financially helps her family. Her husband is employed as a salesperson, but his income is insufficient to support the family members alone.\r\n\r\nAlmost two years ago, Ms. Amina took the initiative in her area and started an academy that offers educational services to poor students at cheap rates so they can have a better future.

They run a family-owned dairy farm with two milk cows. Tinatin produces cheese and sells it in the village. In addition, they grow nuts and persimmons on the family-owned land. The family's average monthly income is 300 GEL ( Georgian Lari: 1 GEL = .60 USD). It is not enough to provide Tinatin and her family with adequate living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTinatin has requested a loan from Credo to re-start her family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up, and re-start-up with fewer conditions, to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income, and they often do not have access to credit. With the credit, Tinatin will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. She will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard, She will raise and sell the chickens for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGenie hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngelina operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 Philippine in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelina hopes to have a deeper relationship with God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week.  It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Teresita is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business.

They have been involved in agriculture for 15 years. The main source of income for Anna is selling the harvest in local markets. She also keeps a freezer, where she keeps the fruits to sell during winter. \r\n\r\nAs for the main part of the harvest from the orchard, Anna sells it after gathering it. She would like to purchase more fruits to keep in the freezer. With the loan's help, she will purchase four tons of pears, three tons of peaches and one ton of persimmons. This allows Anna to have stable income all year, which is vital for her to cover her household costs and children's educational costs.

Her husband is employed in a security guard firm and earns insufficient income to support his family alone. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of three children. She is motivated to provide for her family. As she wants to grow her business, she requested a loan of Rs 20,000 to buy rice, children's sweets, flour, etc. from the market at lower rates. She then would be able to meet the increasing demand consistently. She is in her 2nd loan cycle and has shown excellent repayment behavior. She wishes to utilize part of the revenues to deal with personal expenses and to increase business capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.67,"image":{"id":1203570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy rice, children's sweets, flour, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bashiran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1415},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1944}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.92,"local_amount":1415,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1506.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315428527,"comment":null},{"amount":16.39,"local_amount":1457,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323033686,"comment":null},{"amount":16.86,"local_amount":1499,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1596.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331169827,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339552576,"comment":null},{"amount":17.87,"local_amount":1588,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1690.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347102442,"comment":null},{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355847615,"comment":null},{"amount":18.94,"local_amount":1683,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1791.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556293,"comment":null},{"amount":19.48,"local_amount":1732,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1844.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372954793,"comment":null},{"amount":20.05,"local_amount":1782,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1897.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381734637,"comment":null},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1952.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390821674,"comment":null},{"amount":42.78,"local_amount":3832,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4079.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.33,"payment_id":399842267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-01T17:01:41Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T13:35:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":477173,"name":"Anthony Jerry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Anthony.

She will expand her business if she makes enough profit in the future to do so. \r\n\r\nTahira is a member of an 8-person group and has requested a loan from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a sewing machine, which will help her to stitch more dresses and to satisfy the needs of her clients more professionally. She hopes, with the help of the loan, to reach her desired net income and be able to save for their future. She dreams of giving her children a quality education.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":1203487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married and has three children. Two of her children go to school. She rents a drug shop business in which she sells products on a retail basis. She has been in business for the last nine years. She also gets additional income from keeping poultry. She works seven days a week.  She has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from MCDT \u2013 SACCO to buy boxes of syrups, syringes, and cotton\/wool. Her major business challenges are transportation, defaulters, and seasonality.

He did not have the chance to attend school. Early on, he became interested in revenue-generating businesses, especially in buying, stocking, and selling grains. He learned this business from his maternal uncle, who was once a major grain merchant. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying his clearly growing customer base, he decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After having correctly repaid to loans, he is now on his third individual loan for buying 5 tonnes of grains (corn, beans, millet, 'fonio') from peasant producers in and around KELEYA.

She loves them: they are her main reason for living. Unfortunately, for several reasons, she is separated. Since her separation, she dedicates all her efforts to improving her family's lot in life. She is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person. In her spare time, she likes sharing good moments with her family. With a lot of efforts and enthusiasm, Karen started her own small business selling butter beans and raisins. She also owns a car, which she rents out to several drivers who use it to provide a taxi service. She starts working early every day. She attributes her success to her efforts, her dedication, and her nice manner towards her customers. Karen is very grateful to Kiva lenders since, thanks to their help, she will be able to perform repairs as well as general maintenance on her automobile. This will enable her to buy merchandise for her business (sacks of butter beans and raisins), in order to have more stock. With her vehicle in better repair, she hopes to improve her sales and increase her income, which would be of tremendous help to expand her business and give her child a good life and a good education, since her dream is to see him become a respectable professional and a good man.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1185460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to perform

This city is known for its warm and welcoming climate.  It is also known for its agriculture, in particular the production of lima beans, cotton, asparagus and other crops.  There are also a lot of tourist sites here including the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Huacachina\">Huacachina Lake<\/a> which is visited by many tourists year round.  Whenever she has any free time, Margarita really enjoys listening to music.  Above all, however, she enjoys spending her free time with her family because she and her husband have four children who she loves dearly and she works hard every day so that she can offer them a decent life and, above all, a lot of love.  Owing to her limited financial resources, Margarita was only able to study up to the fifth year of her secondary education.

She worked as a machinist in a free trade zone. She resigned and with her settlement she opened a small grocery store. With the loans she has received from AFODENIC she has invested and expanded her business, and for this reason she needs the loan to keep stocking her store with more products such as basic grains, canned goods, soft drinks, candy, vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, peppers, bananas, and lemons, cereals, and other items.

She can work approximately eight hours, and believes that it is going well because of the variety of products, and because of the friendly service she offers her customers. \r\n\r\nAna is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to the help provided, she will be able to purchase a display case and merchandise such as perfumes, cosmetics, lotions, and other products. This way, Ana will have a better-equipped and stocked store.

He is grateful to Afodenic and Kiva for their unconditional support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1187528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials such as cement blocks, cement, iron, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-10-01T07:02:30Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-31T07:02:30Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468964,"name":"Felix Amada","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a F\u00e9lix Amada contin\u00faa con su negocio de compra y destace de cerdo semanal producto que luego ella vende procesado en alimentos oficio que aprendi\u00f3 hace aproximadamente 40 a\u00f1os.
