He lives in the small village of Baghdati District with his pensioner parents, wife and daughter. Robert requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nHis family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have three milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, they have a vineyard. They pick grapes seasonally and produce wine for selling. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRobert requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Robert has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Robert will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, they will be able to sow different kinds of vegetables there to sell. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":717.76,"image":{"id":1373207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build a greenhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Meore Obcha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":131.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":138.32},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":141.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":152.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":158.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":162.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":165.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":168.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.34},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.49},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.9,"local_amount":106.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":106.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613768,"comment":null},{"amount":116.6,"local_amount":116.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":116.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857480,"comment":null},{"amount":119.02,"local_amount":119.02,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":119.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134130,"comment":null},{"amount":123.13,"local_amount":123.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":123.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107717,"comment":null},{"amount":124.03,"local_amount":124.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":124.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255253,"comment":null},{"amount":128.08,"local_amount":128.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":128.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-20T23:05:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573285,"name":"Deborah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deborah is a very enterprising, responsible, honest and hardworking person.

Vazha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Fredis vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nFredis emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de agricultura desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, espec\u00edficamente con el cacao que es un fruto muy demandado a nivel de empresas exportadoras y tambi\u00e9n fabricantes de chocolates, es por esto que Fredis se dedica con mucho cuidado al mantenimiento de los cultivos lo que le lleva al menos 6 horas todos los d\u00edas, pues al menor descuido, las plantaciones quedar\u00edan arruinados y habr\u00eda mucha p\u00e9rdida.

","en":"Fredis is a 32-year-old man. He was educated up to the end of secondary school and began to work to provide for his household, which is made up of his wife Mercy, who is 33 years old, and their three children. The children attend public school and he hopes to support them until they earn their professional degrees. Fredis lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton of the province of Esmeraldas, which supplies many cities in Ecuador with products like bananas, cacao, coffee, palm oil, and lumber. In addition, the majority of the inhabitants work in commerce every day in order to make a living, especially since the roads to this canton have been expanded, allowing for a great deal of commercial traffic. Especially on weekends, all kinds of vendors come out to offer their products to potential customers, who are usually from the rural areas, in the outdoor market. Tourism is also an important contribution to this canton, since the natural ecosystem has a large variety of places to visit\u2014waterfalls, freshwater rivers, forests\u2014that have flowers and animals that adorn this city.\r\n\r\nFredis began his farming business ten years ago, specifically with cacao, a crop that is very much in demand by export companies and chocolate makers. For this reason, Fredis carefully works at maintaining his crops, which takes at least six hours a day, as a moment's neglect would mean the plantings would be ruined and there would be great losses. With the experience that Fredis has gained in these years of business, he is sure that he is ready to increase his production volume. That's why he is requesting a loan to purchase seeds and fertilizers to properly sow new crops in the plots of land that he has already prepared. Fredis is sure that with this increase, he will be able to fill the large orders that he gets and thereby obtain greater earnings, enabling his business continue to grow and be recognized in the area by wholesale buyers of cacao. Fredis has always had trouble meeting the requirements that financial institutions demand in order to grant loans; however, Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa presented the Kiva product, with which it is possible to get the support of various people around the world who want to him to grow in his business venture.

Once approved, he used the loan to purchase a tire changer and an air compression machine, and he become an entrepreneur almost instantaneously. \r\n\r\nMiguel says the Accion loan allowed his business to open sooner. Without it, he says it would have taken almost three months longer to offer his services to the community. But instead, in May 2013, Miguel left his friend\u2019s business to open his own tire shop and is now optimistic about the future of his business.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1373464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a tire changer and an air compression machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Austin, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T13:30:08Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.42},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.49},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.6},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574033,"name":"Dieu Merci De Nossin Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme ANDREA repr\u00e9sente le groupe  DIEU MERCI DE NOSSIN.

familia, ya que desde muy joven decidi\u00f3 establecer un hogar con su pareja Elena que actualmente tiene 34 a\u00f1os y con quien tiene 4 hijos de los cuales 2 est\u00e1n ya estudiando en la escuela primaria en una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Wilson vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nWilson se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, la falta de empleo lo llev\u00f3 a especializarse en esta fruta para la posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas a esta labor heredada de varios familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la misma actividad. Wilson sue\u00f1a con ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales ya que \u00e9l no pudo lograrlo; es por esto que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza para que nunca les falte lo necesario para cumplir con sus estudios. Con la experiencia que ha ganado tanto en la producci\u00f3n como en la comercializaci\u00f3n, Wilson desea ampliar el terreno de cultivos para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 semillas, abonos y adem\u00e1s algunas herramientas para mantener en perfecto estado sus cultivos. Wilson espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ganancias se incrementen y as\u00ed poder ofrecer a su familia un estilo de vida c\u00f3modo y de calidad. Este hombre responsable agradece la asesor\u00eda y credibilidad de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a siempre dejar ese grano de arena que tanto necesitan los emprendedores como \u00e9l, pues muchas veces el estancamiento se da por la falta de capital que en ocasiones se torna imposible conseguir.","en":"Wilson is a man of 31 who graduated high school and then decided to work to support his family.  He had decided when he was very young to settle down with his partner, Elena, 34, with whom he has four children, two of whom are in public grade school.  Wilson lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeraldas Province that provides products like bananas, cacao, coffee, African palm and forest products to various cities in Ecuador, accounting for the livelihood of most of its inhabitants, who work in related business to get ahead.  The area has allowed for a great deal of commercial activity as still more people travel here, especially on weekends, when all manner businesspeople offer their products at markets to potential clients, most of whom tend to be rural farmers.   The natural ecosystem is widely varied throughout the area, so tourism is also a significant to this canton, where people come to see waterfalls, freshwater rivers, and forests with animals and flowers that grace the city.  \r\n\r\nWilson has earned his living producing cacao for ten years.  Lack of work drove him to specialize in growing this crop to sell.  He devotes several hours a day to his profession, which he came by from various relatives who also work in the same business.  Wilson dreams of seeing his children have professions, since he was never able to.  That's why he endeavors every day, so that they lack for nothing they need to finish school. \r\n\r\nUsing his experience both in production and sales Wilson would like to expand his crop fields, so he needs a loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and some tools to keep his crops in perfect condition.  He hopes that with this investment his profits will increase and he can offer his family a life of quality and comfort.  He is a responsible man.  He appreciates Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa's advice and financing, and encourages Kiva lenders to always put in their grain of sand; it's so needed by businesspeople like him who are frequently impeded by lack of capital, which at times makes it impossible for them to succeed.

The women from this community are still in the habit of dressing in their traditional outfits.  These colorful outfits are made by the women themselves.  The traditional fabric with which they make the outfits is called satin.  Also, for accessories they wear a large necklace around their neck, and one cannot miss their earrings.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this community make a living by raising animals and growing corn.  The group \"Rancher\u00eda\" is made up of four members, all of whom are hard-working and responsible women.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa is 64 years old, has been married to Se\u00f1or Francisco for 16 years, and together they form a family with 12 children; 8 men and 4 women. \r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa has made a living by raising, fattening, and selling lambs for 30 years.  Do\u00f1a Luisa buys medium-sized lambs, then raises and fattens them. Later, she sells the lambs to the those who barbecue; the larger and fatter the lamb, the better the pay.  This time she is asking for the loan to buy more lambs.  She does not know the exact quantity because she does not have the prices, but with the extra money she plans to buy feed.  \r\n\r\nShe tells how she began this work: \"My mom also had lambs when I was very young.  Since then I have known how to care for these little animals.  When I started to live with my husband, I wanted to help with the household expenses and education costs.  Since my children were young and I could not go out to work, I dedicated myself to raising lambs.  It was the best option because that way I was keeping an eye on my children.\"\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luisa's lambs are a very good source of income because her husband is sick and cannot work.  Thus, when they need money she only has to sell her lambs so that they don't suffer financial problems.  However, the trouble that Do\u00f1a Luisa faces is the lack of a good farmyard because without it her little lambs can get sick and die in lower temperatures.

mud\u00f3 siendo muy joven en busca de mejores oportunidades y se cas\u00f3 con  Mar\u00eda una mujer trabajadora que ahora tiene 54 a\u00f1os y con quien Miguel tuvo 3 hijos quienes son independientes y cada uno ya form\u00f3 su familia. Ahora Miguel vive con su esposa en su casa en Quito la capital de los ecuatorianos, en el barrio llamado \u201cChillogallo\u201d ubicado al sur de la ciudad, sector que hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles, un sector en el cual su alta actividad comercial es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nMiguel aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres la actividad de la agricultura, labor a la que se dedica desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, ya que hab\u00eda falta de empleo en la empresa privada y la necesidad cada vez era m\u00e1s grande; Miguel invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas incluidos los fines de semana en el peque\u00f1o terreno que en su gran mayor\u00eda tiene cultivos de papas, las cuales comercializa en los principales mercados de la ciudad y del pueblo y tambi\u00e9n recibe ayuda de su esposa quien adem\u00e1s se ocupa de los quehaceres del hogar. Miguel desea incrementar la producci\u00f3n de sus cultivos para lo cual ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de semillas y fertilizantes para el cuidado de la tierra y los cultivos. Con este incremento sus utilidades ser\u00e1n mejores y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 llevar el sustento a su casa y adem\u00e1s mejorar la calidad de vida con su esposa. Miguel es consciente de que con el paso de los a\u00f1os sus fuerzas se debilitar\u00e1n y luego se le dificultar\u00e1 realizar el trabajo que realiza, pero mientras eso suceda, \u00e9l pondr\u00e1 mucho empe\u00f1o en generar utilidades con su negocio y prever\u00e1 un ahorro para las necesidades de salud y sustento que pueda tener en el futuro. Miguel est\u00e1 agradecido por la oportunidad de obtener el cr\u00e9dito con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, quienes adem\u00e1s han demostrado estar preocupados por su crecimiento personal y estabilidad laboral. ","en":"Miguel is a 50 year-old man who grew up living with his parents in a town in the countryside, where he was able to finish elementary school.  He moved when he was very young in search of better opportunities, and he married Maria, a hardworking woman, who is now 54 years old and with whom Miguel has 3 children.  His children are now independent, each one having formed their own family.  Now Miguel lives with his wife in their home in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in a neighborhood called \"Chillogallo,\" located in the southern part of the city.  This is an area that, until just a few years ago, was not considered to be one of the economic strongholds of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  But now this area is considered a force in the economy of the city.  Here, there are enterprising families who have fought to get ahead.  Between the natives, and migrants from other cities and countries, this area has been a meeting place for residents from various provinces.  The area has been rebuilt with extensive streets, and is a neighborhood with a high level of commercial activity that keeps on getting more active, and supports the economic growth of the city in an important way.  This area is outstanding because of its parks and extensive green areas, where families get together on the weekends.  A large variety of services are accessible here, and the residents are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself by launching new businesses.\r\n\r\nMiguel learned to farm from his parents, and he's been doing this work for 6 years because there was no work available in private companies, and his needs were growing over time.  Miguel spends a number of hours each day, including on weekends, working on his small plot of land where he mostly grows potatoes.  He sells his crops in the main markets in the city and town.  He is assisted by his wife, who also carries out the household chores.  \r\n\r\nMiguel wants to increase his production of crops.  To do this, he is requesting a loan to invest in seeds and in fertilizer to care for the crops and the land.  With this increased production his profits will increase, and so he will be able to support his household and also improve his family's quality of life.

exist\u00edan ya no pudieron apoyarle para continuar sus estudios, por lo que ayudaba a sus padres en las labores de campo y luego se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar para mantener a su familia, ya que desde muy joven decidi\u00f3 establecer un hogar con su pareja Marcia que actualmente tiene 25 a\u00f1os y con quien tiene 2 hijos estudiando en la escuela primaria en una instituci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Roberto vive con su familia en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nRoberto se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao desde hace 20 a\u00f1os, la falta de empleo lo llev\u00f3 a especializarse en esta fruta para la posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, la aprendi\u00f3 de su familia desde que era un ni\u00f1o e invierte varias horas todos los d\u00edas a esta labor heredada de varios familiares que tambi\u00e9n se dedicaban a la misma actividad. Roberto sue\u00f1a con ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales ya que \u00e9l no pudo lograrlo; es por esto que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza para que nunca les falte lo necesario para cumplir con sus estudios. Con la experiencia que ha ganado tanto en la producci\u00f3n como en la comercializaci\u00f3n, Roberto desea ampliar el terreno de cultivos para lo cual requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 semillas, fertilizantes y adem\u00e1s algunas herramientas para mantener en perfecto estado sus cultivos. Roberto espera que con esta inversi\u00f3n sus ganancias se incrementen y as\u00ed poder ofrecer a su familia un estilo de vida c\u00f3modo y de calidad. Este hombre responsable agradece la asesor\u00eda y credibilidad de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y motiva a los inversionistas de Kiva a siempre dejar ese grano de arena que tanto necesitan los emprendedores como \u00e9l, pues muchas veces el estancamiento se da por la falta de capital que en ocasiones se torna imposible conseguir.","en":"Roberto, 32, has a primary school education. Due to his family's lack of financial resources, they could not support him to continue his studies, so he helped his parents with the farm labor. He later worked to support his own family, because at a young age he decided to establish a home with his partner, Marcia, 25. They have two children together, who are studying in a public primary school.\r\n\r\nRoberto lives with his family in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in the province of Esmeraldas which provides products such as bananas, cocoa, coffee, African palm, and forest products to various cities in Ecuador. Commerce makes up the daily work for the majority of the canton's inhabitants, allowing them to move ahead. This is especially true now that the routes to the canton have increased, allowing for a great volume of trade movement, particularly on the weekends when all kinds of traders come out to the fairs to offer products to potential clients, who are often farmers. Tourism is also a very important contribution to the canton, because its natural ecosystem offers a great variety of places to visit such as waterfalls, freshwater rivers, forests, and the flowers and animals that one can see in the city.\r\n\r\nRoberto has worked in cocoa production for 20 years. The lack of employment led him to specialize in this fruit, which he later trades. He learned about the business from his family when he was a child. He invests many hours every day in this labor, which he inherited from several relatives who worked in the same business. \r\n\r\nRoberto dreams of seeing his children become professionals, because he was not able to do so. Therefore, he works hard every day so that they lack nothing for their studies. With the experience he has gained in production as well as trade, Roberto would like to expand his farmlands. Therefore, he needs this loan to buy seeds, fertilizer, and some tools to maintain his crops in perfect condition. This responsible man is grateful for the advice and credibility of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, and he motivates the Kiva lenders to leave that grain of sand which entrepreneurs like him need so badly. Many times, stagnation results from a lack of capital which is sometimes impossible to achieve.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":626.63,"image":{"id":1375094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quinind\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":84.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":93.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":95.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.96,"local_amount":82.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313801,"comment":null},{"amount":85.47,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565417,"comment":null},{"amount":86.59,"local_amount":85.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":86.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814455,"comment":null},{"amount":91.11,"local_amount":90.4,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":91.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320628,"comment":null},{"amount":91.57,"local_amount":90.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856318,"comment":null},{"amount":93.05,"local_amount":92.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":93.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059893,"comment":null},{"amount":95.88,"local_amount":95.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":95.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T14:14:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574573,"name":"Doroteo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Doroteo, vive con su esposa, tiene hijos los cuales no est\u00e1n junto con \u00e9l, porqu\u00e9 viven aparte.

Actualmente Angel vive solo en Quinind\u00e9; un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad. En varios sectores  de esta provincia, residen familias que se dedican a la agricultura, y muchas veces su esfuerzo no es valorado, pues las empresas pagan costos muy bajos por los frutos que sus tierras producen, sin embargo, el sustento siempre est\u00e1 presente.\nAngel se ha dedicado al comercio en varias \u00e1reas y ha trabajado por siempre dar a sus hijos lo que necesitaban, hace 6 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 emprender independientemente con un negocio de venta de art\u00edculos para uso personal, como vinchas, cepillo y pastas dentales, shampoo, rinse, gel, etc. Este negocio lo ha establecido en un peque\u00f1o pasillo de su casa en el centro de la ciudad e invierte al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en su local y sus clientes son cada vez m\u00e1s con el paso del tiempo, aunque como en todo negocio existen temporadas en las que las ventas son muy bajas. Angel afirma que en este negocio es muy importante contar con la variedad de productos, pues as\u00ed los clientes podr\u00e1n encontrar todo lo que necesitan en el mismo lugar. Este hombre que se ha convertido en un experto por la experiencia y conociiento emp\u00edricos a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 preparado para crecer con su negocio para lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la adquisici\u00f3n de perfumes variados para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os que es un producto de alta demanda y con el que hasta el momento no lo ha tenido en su negocio. Angel espera que con este incremento de surtido, sus clientes sean m\u00e1s y por lo tanto sus utilidades se incrementen para de esta forma un d\u00eda poder mejorar la infraestructura de su negocio y ampliar el local.","en":"Angel is a responsible and entrepreneurial person. He is 58 years old, and in spite of only finishing primary school, he has always worked to improve his standard of living. He is single. He has 4 children, all of whom are economically independent and have their own families, but still visit their father periodically. Angel lives alone in Quinind\u00e9, a cant\u00f3n of the province of Esmeraldas, which provides various cities in Ecuador with products such as banana, cacao, coffee, African palm, and forest products. Commerce is the daily work of the majority of the area\u2019s inhabitants. This increased when the roads to the cant\u00f3n were improved, allowing greater commercial movement, especially on the weekends when merchants of all sorts come out to offer their products in the markets to their potential customers, who usually are rural farmers. Tourism is also an important source of income for this cant\u00f3n because its natural ecosystem has a great variety of places to visit, such as waterfalls, rivers, and forests which have flowers and animals that adorn this city. In several areas of the province, families dedicate themselves to agriculture. Many times their effort is not appreciated and business pay very low prices for the products their lands produce. Even so, this way of life is always present.\r\n\r\nAngel has worked in commerce in various places and he always worked to give his children what they needed. Six years ago, he decided to start his own business selling personal products, such as headbands, brushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, etc. He established his business in a small corridor in his house in the center of the city, and he spends at least 8 hours per day in his store. He has more and more customers as time goes by, though, as with all businesses, there are periods when sales are slow. Angel explains that in this business it is very important to have a good variety of products so that the customers can find everything they need in one place. He has become an expert through experience and empirical knowledge  through the years, and now he is prepared to grow his business. In order to do this he is requesting a loan that he will use to buy a variety of perfumes for women, men, and children, which is a product that is in high demand and which, until now, he has not had in his business. Angel hopes that with this addition to his inventory his number of customers will grow and that his income will also grow so that one day he will be able to improve his business\u2019s infrastructure and expand the store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1375138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She is very happy to continue working with Prisma and with the support of this loan will buy more milk and have more product to offer customers.\r\n\r\nSara's dream is to further improve her business, and employ more people who don't have work in her community. \r\n\r\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - May 2013\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1375182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","use":"To buy dry firewood, milk, quesillo and rennet tablets for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1014,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390878073,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399914447,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1014,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197026,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960437,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1014,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429614304,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840727,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T18:42:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574604,"name":"Flora Alicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flora,  se le presenta la necesidad de optar por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo  porque requiere m\u00e1s capital de trabajo, ya que el negocio esta rentable; este le servir\u00e1 para comprar le\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, cal para la elaboracion de tortillas.\nEl cr\u00e9dito anterior le ayudo a cubrir la demanda existente y aumentar la clientela; esto ha hecho que las condiciones econ\u00f3micas y las circunstancias familiares mejoren.\n","en":"The need has arisen for Flora to apply for a new loan, because she needs more working capital, as her business is profitable.

It also has various tourist attractions that, accompanied by its warm climate, are very busy with national and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its inhabitants have started some kind of commercial or service activity for locals and tourists.\r\n\r\nMaritza always helped her mother making athletic clothing, and she learned a lot about this work. She has worked with her mother, earning part of her income, and through it covering her necessities. Four years ago, she decided to go independent, looking for new customers and making clothing. Nevertheless, she had to go to her mother to use her sewing machine. Now Maritza is asking for a loan to acquire her own sewing machine and dedicate herself full time to making athletic clothing. With her sewing machine it will be easier to allocate her time waiting on customers, producing, and designing. Since it is her first loan, she had difficulty getting support from financial institutions until someone recommended Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to her. There she received the confidence, access, and flexibility she needed. Additionally, her account executive gave her some advice on managing her resources and making her business venture into a successful microbusiness. Maritza also thanks everyone around the world who, through the valuable work of Kiva, are participants in the dreams and growth of people like her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":808.32,"image":{"id":1375185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T22:50:07Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":92.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":96.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":103.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.65,"local_amount":157.41,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":158.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565419,"comment":null},{"amount":246.51,"local_amount":244.58,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":246.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320630,"comment":null},{"amount":403.16,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":403.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059895,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T13:29:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573571,"name":"Sumaira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumaira, a member of a two-person borrowing group, is a 38-year-old hardworking and diligent woman.

In particular, she has a plot of land where nut trees are grown.  In addition, she has an agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown.  She sells the harvested products at local markets at a good price.  There is hardly enough food for the family.  According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNatela requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business.  Natela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.  These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.  With this credit Natela will purchase a milking cow.  After the milking cow is purchased she will be able to produce dairy products for sale.

Este joven realiza dos actividades productivas; la primera pero no la menos importante es la crianza de aves de corral  (pollos de engorde), la segunda es la crianza de ganado como son: vacas, chivas, terneras y toros, estas actividades las ejerce en un terreno que se encuentra anexo a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n. Este terreno cuenta con todos las condiciones para la crianza de pollos y ganado bovino, por la ma\u00f1ana limpia los comederos de los pollos y del ganado. Luego les da su alimento, en el trascurso del d\u00eda, cuida que todo se encuentre en perfectas condiciones ya que los pollos requieren de mucho cuidado ya que son unas aves muy delicadas. Cuenta aproximadamente con un promedio de 3 a\u00f1os de ejercer esta actividad. Tambi\u00e9n cabe mencionar que su mama desde hace mas de 30 a\u00f1os ha ejercido esta actividad y es ella quien lo orienta para que todo le salga muy bien. Antes de dedicarse a esta actividad estaba estudiando; pero por problemas econ\u00f3micos ya no sigui\u00f3 los estudios universitarios.      \n\nLos pollos de engorde, los compra a los proveedores de productos que son los especialistas en la crianza de pollos, ellos prestan un servicio agregado que son las revisiones semanales o quincenales para ver c\u00f3mo va el crecimiento de los pollos. Estos los compran en la ciudad, que se encuentra a una distancia de 1 kil\u00f3metro de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\nEl ganado bovino es comprado en el tiangue de la misma ciudad que tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la misma distancia anteriormente dicha.    \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo,  es para comprar 300 pollos de engorde.\n2 vacas lecheras, 2 terneras, el resto del financiamiento ser\u00e1 invertido en el arreglo de la maya cicl\u00f3n de donde se encuentran los pollos ya que est\u00e1 en mal estado.  \n\n      Con el cr\u00e9dito incrementara su hato de ganado y la crianza de 300 pollos de engorde ya que actualmente cuenda con otros 300 que ya est\u00e1n listos para la venta. Al comprar todos estos pollos y el ganado incrementaran sus inventarios y por ende la ventas ser\u00e1n mayores y por supuesto sus ganancias tambi\u00e9n y de esta manera podr\u00e1 hacer otras inversiones que tiene pensado.  \n\nSus prop\u00f3sitos, en primer lugar quiere construir una galera m\u00e1s para la crianza de los pollos debido a que la que tiene actualmente es muy peque\u00f1a y est\u00e1 bastante en mal estado, tambi\u00e9n la construcci\u00f3n de comederos y bebederos para el ganado. Y por \u00faltimo quiere seguir estudiando una carrera universitaria.   \n","en":"Rudy is 21 years old. He is single. This young man engages in two kinds of productive work: the first, but not least important, is raising poultry (broiler chickens). The second is raising livestock such as cows, goats, calves, and bulls. He does both of these on a piece of land attached to his house. This land has everything necessary to raise chickens and cows. In the morning, he cleans the troughs of the chickens and cows. Then he feeds them. Throughout the day, he maintains everything he encounters in perfect condition, since the chickens require a lot of care because they are very delicate birds. He has been doing this work for an average of approximately 3 years. It is also worth mentioning that his mother has done this work for more than 30 years, and it is she who points him in the right direction so everything goes very well for him. Before starting this work, he was studying, but due to financial problems he is no longer pursuing university studies.\r\n\r\nHe buys the broiler chickens from the providers who specialize in raising chickens. They provide an added service of weekly or bimonthly checks to see how the chickens\u2019 growth is going. He buys these in the city, which is 1 kilometer from his house.\r\n\r\nHe buys the cows at the small market in the same city that is the same distance away as mentioned previously.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 300 broiler chickens, 2 milk cows, and 2 calves. The rest of the financing will be used to repair the chain-link fence where the chickens are, since it is in bad shape.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will increase his herd of cattle and raise 300 broiler chickens, since he currently has 300 others that are ready for sale. His inventory will increase on buying all these chickens and therefore his sales will be larger and of course his earnings as well. In this way, he will be able to make other investments he is thinking of.\r\n\r\nHis goals are: first, he wants to build one more coop to raise the chickens, since the one he currently has is very small and is in pretty bad shape. He also wants to build feed and water troughs for the cattle. And finally, he wants to continue studying for a university degree.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":348.42,"image":{"id":1375155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 300 broiler chickens, 2 milk cows, and 2 calves.

She works alone, and she sells the fish after obtaining them from already established providers. Her customers vary between casual customers and fish traders from the city. Her main tool to gain customers is her great charisma and eloquence. She has been doing this work for 10 years, and she has learned a lot about the management of fish and its seasons. Because of this, she has become an excellent administrator of her business, and she always receives a good profit from her work. She likes what she does, and she has a good income, although her only irritation is not to have a fixed place to sell. For this reason, she has to sell in the same place where she acquires the fish, which depends on the fishing day. This is her seventh loan with Kiva, so she is thankful for the opportunity and confidence they give her to continue with her business. She therefore promises to make her loan repayments in a punctual manner. \r\n\r\nShe will use the amount requested of 1000 soles to buy wholesale fish."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1375249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy wholesale fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-22T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-22T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":171.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":183.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":154.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":159.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997188,"comment":null},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":151.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":155.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864656,"comment":null},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":164.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":169.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353025,"comment":null},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":171.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":176.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904789,"comment":null},{"amount":65.27,"local_amount":174.06,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":179.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090796,"comment":null},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":183.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":189.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777435,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T20:11:11Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573609,"name":"Marites","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marites.

Specifically, they have three milking cows whose milk is used to make cheese products. In addition, they have a vineyard with 1200 wine trees. They pick grapes seasonally and produce wine to sell. They sell wine and cheese locally at a good price. However, there is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIvane has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business and he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low income. With his credit, Ivane will purchase a minibus and will begin trade with groceries. He will transport groceries to sell with his minibus to different villages.  This will be an additional source of income for his large family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Faizidin is currently planning to start a new business. He is interested in shared taxi services, since he has work experience in this sector.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct-selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nMelencia hopes to grow her business and have more branches. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1373879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for additional supplies and merchandise products like clothing, footwear, undergarments and cosmetics needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670266,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2859.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534800,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784195,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1066.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771188,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T05:04:16Z","paid_date":"2013-10-20T08:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573638,"name":"Norol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norol is 48 years old, married and has eight children, four of whom are in school.

For 10 years she has been working in business, selling women\u2019s dresses, footwear, perfume, and toiletries.  The idea to start a business came to her at a very young age because she liked having her own income and managing her own money. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why as an adult, when she saw that as a business woman one of her friends was successful and able to support her family with her income, Diana decided to do the same.  At first, her cousin lent her money.  She bought merchandise and sold it to several different customers.  In a matter of 3 months, she was able to pay her cousin back and make a profit. \r\n\r\nThese days, she works selling her main products which are clothing, women\u2019s footwear, and other miscellaneous items.  Her business is going very well.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first time financing through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to purchase personal orders at special discounts for her best customers.  She will buy footwear, facial powders, creams, and perfumes which are featured in her catalogues.  Such an investment will impact her customers\u2019 pockets because she will be able to offer good prices.  Her Kiva loan will be successful precisely because her greatest challenge was finding enough capital to be able to respond to the demands of her customers, and now, thanks to Kiva, she will be able to do exactly that.   \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to have her own storefront and to generate more income so that she can improve the quality of her daughter\u2019s education.  By giving her daughter the opportunity to study in excellent educational institutions, she will strengthen her chance for success in the future.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170.33,"image":{"id":1375209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy personal orders, such as footwear, facial powders, creams, and perfumes for her best clients.

In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow tomatoes, watermelons and eggplants. They sell the harvested products at local markets. Besides this, Gocha has a tractor which is rented out seasonally. It is hardly enough for the family's food expenses. According to Credo estimations, his family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\nGocha has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Gocha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Gocha will purchase a minibus. After the minibus is purchased, he will be able to begin trading with fruits and vegetables. This will help increase the income of their family.

She is married to the father of her two children, who are aged thirteen and seven years old each.  The family lives together in their privately owned home.\r\n\r\nVilma makes a living selling wood chips that she buys in bulk in order to sell to farmers.  She does this work from home as she stores the wood chips in large plastic bags.  Vilma has been doing this work for over five years and receives help from her husband.  In the beginning, this work was complicated as Vilma did not know anything about this kind of business but, with time, she has learned a lot and now has the necessary knowledge to keep her customers happy.  What Vilma likes about her work is that she can use her time to do other things as well.

Mar\u00eda has been working in farming and growing coffee for over eight years.  She learned this trade from her parents, who were farmers all their lives.

is 61 years old.  He lives in Kesalo village, Gardabani district with his 50 year old wife, 27 year old son and retired mother in-law.  Viladin requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows.  The cows are milked everyday to produce dairy products.  The products are sold at the local markets and among the villagers.  The family has additional income from Viladin\u2019s mother in-law\u2019s monthly pension. \r\n\r\nViladin requested loan from Credo to start up a family business.  Viladin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.  These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Viladin will purchase a mini-bus.  Kesalo is a small village and the nearest market is in Gardabani district.  It\u2019s hard for the local people to travel there to buy the daily products as there are not many transports going in that direction.  Viladin will drive the bus to transport his villagers to Gardabani center, where they can purchase all the needed products.  Viladin will start earning additional income for the family and also will help his villagers to have better access to the city.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1130.7,"image":{"id":1373996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase a mini-bus","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kesalo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T13:10:24Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T13:10:24Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viladin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":294.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":301.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":311.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":317.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":327.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":341.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":353.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":359.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":368.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":377.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":189.45,"local_amount":312.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":312.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613778,"comment":null},{"amount":178.49,"local_amount":294.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":294.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857490,"comment":null},{"amount":182.97,"local_amount":301.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":301.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134140,"comment":null},{"amount":189.09,"local_amount":311.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":312,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107727,"comment":null},{"amount":192.33,"local_amount":317.24,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":317.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255263,"comment":null},{"amount":198.37,"local_amount":327.21,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":327.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019397,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T09:12:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573726,"name":"Nemuta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nemuta is 29 years, married to Kaiseiyye and supports a family of seven members.

This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, running water, sewing machine' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":219.77,"image":{"id":1374025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Weldon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3235.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3321.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3499.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3591.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3686.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3784.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3884.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3986.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4092.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4200.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4312.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.35,"local_amount":3301.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3457.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417354,"comment":null},{"amount":82.42,"local_amount":6743.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7061.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880896,"comment":null},{"amount":97,"local_amount":7936.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":8310.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529515,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T22:51:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574674,"name":"Jose Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jos\u00e9 de 43 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa y su hija, el se dedica a la venta de llantas desde hace varios a\u00f1os, tiene  mucha clientela pues vende a buen precio su producto, con la ganancias que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, Don Jos\u00e9 est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar llantas por mayor y seguir con su trabajo  ya que esa es su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y asi poderle dar a su familia una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"Don Jos\u00e9 is 43 years old and lives in his own house with his wife and daughter.

He sells sports clothing, and his business is going really well.

","en":"Toir is a 20 years old young man. He is single and lives with his parents, sister and brother in the city of Dushanbe. Toir is a herdsman. He helps his father with breeding cattle. He also has a dairy cow with a calf, which he looks after himself. Every morning his mother milks the cow, and sells the five liters of milk to her customers. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Toir would like to start his own livestock breeding business, as he has now acquired sufficient experience in this business. He intends to purchase around three heads of cattle per month, and after having fattened them, sell them at the local market with a good profit. \r\n\r\nToir has a starting capital of the amount of around 7,000 somoni (TJS). Nonetheless, he needs to take a loan. For the loan amount and the savings, Toir would like to purchase three bulls and their fodder, and also expand the cowshed and carry out repair work there. He will appreciate the support very much. Thanks to the loan he will finally have his own business and expand it in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":436.2,"image":{"id":1374703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase three bulls and their fodder to start a business of fattening and reselling cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":76.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":95.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.95,"local_amount":68.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":68.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390629041,"comment":null},{"amount":70.23,"local_amount":70.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":70.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399873238,"comment":null},{"amount":71.82,"local_amount":71.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":71.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410149985,"comment":null},{"amount":73.49,"local_amount":73.49,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":73.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913152,"comment":null},{"amount":75.15,"local_amount":75.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":75.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561252,"comment":null},{"amount":76.56,"local_amount":76.56,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030150,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T07:41:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573788,"name":"Marieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In 2010 Marieta opened her general store, which is located in one of the city's markets.

To get income for her family, Kuldar works with livestock breeding and growing of agricultural crops - beans, peppers and wheat. She started this business with the purchase of two cows. Thanks to persistent work, Kuldar currently has two heads of cattle with offspring, 15 sheep and goats and 1.80 hectares of rented land on her farm. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Kuldar turned to the micro finance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to increase the number of cattle through purchasing two bulls. Kuldar plans to invest the income form the loan in further increasing the number of household animals, and also to save money for her future wedding of her son.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":580.29,"image":{"id":1374871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two bull-calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak - Tam village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kuldar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4026},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3657},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3764},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3874},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3987},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4103},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4222},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4346},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4472},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4603},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4737},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4209}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.55,"local_amount":4026,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4095.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631664,"comment":null},{"amount":76.79,"local_amount":3657,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3720.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495569,"comment":null},{"amount":79.05,"local_amount":3764,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3829.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743794,"comment":null},{"amount":81.35,"local_amount":3874,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3940.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014027,"comment":null},{"amount":83.73,"local_amount":3987,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4055.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777095,"comment":null},{"amount":86.16,"local_amount":4103,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4173.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426909,"comment":null},{"amount":88.66,"local_amount":4222,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942492,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T18:42:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574690,"name":"Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reynaldo de 34 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de queso y quesadillas desde hace varios a\u00f1os, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar los gastos de su hogar, Reynaldo est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar botellas con leche por mayor, harina, az\u00facar, etc.  para poder producir m\u00e1s queso y quesadillas pues ese su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y asi poderle dar a su familia una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.","en":"34-year-old Reynaldo has made a living by producing cheese and quesadillas for several years.

They live together in their own home. Mar\u00eda makes her living selling shoes and sandals whether on a fortnightly or a monthly basis, depending on the demand for her products. To obtain her merchandise, Mar\u00eda travels to another city by bus for more than 20 hours, from there, she makes the same journey bringing a large quantity of articles to sell to her relatives, friends and others. The designs that she brings back are the latest style, exclusive and of a high quality, which is why she manages to sell the whole lot in a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nShe sells in the streets, covering the main streets of her city every day in the hunt for customers who want to buy something in her range, or who on occasions make advance orders. Ever since she started this business, it has gone very well for her thanks to her charisma and the quality of each of the items she sells. What she likes most about her job is selling, and she is very happy when her merchandise runs out.

is a 49-year-old vigorous lady; she has been stitching clothes for many years. She stitches for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. However, due to lack of availability of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers.

dif\u00edcil tener que afrontar la responsabilidad de educar sola a sus hijos luego de haberse separado de su esposo con quien comparti\u00f3 muchos a\u00f1os, sin embargo no permiti\u00f3 que las circunstancias negativas afectaran su vida y ha salido adelante con sus hijos y su esfuerzo. Actualmente Carmen vive con sus dos hijos en Quinind\u00e9 un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Esmeraldas que provee a varias ciudades del Ecuador productos como banano, cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad.\nCarmen desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se desempe\u00f1a como agricultora en un terreno que posee en su casa en donde tiene un terreno en el que cultiva cacao un fruto que es considerado como uno de los m\u00e1s significativos s\u00edmbolos del Ecuador, pues es considerado uno de los principales exportadores de cacao. El trabajo que realiza Carmen en sembrar las semillas y cuando \u00e9stas dan fruto entonces clasifica el fruto para venderlo en el mercado y a las familias y las  pepas luego de un per\u00edodo de fermentaci\u00f3n son las que producen el cacao con el que se elabora el m\u00e1s delicioso chocolate que alguien haya probado. Los granos de cacao, una vez secos, se tuestan al fuego en una sart\u00e9n y luego se pelan. A continuaci\u00f3n, dichos granos se muelen, obteniendo as\u00ed el cacao en polvo. Sin embargo antes de todo este proceso, el cuidado de las plantaciones tambi\u00e9n es muy importante, es por esto que Carmen solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar abono con el cual le pueda dar un cuidado de calidad a sus  cultivos y as\u00ed obtener frutos con las caracter\u00edsticas que buscan sus clientes. Para Carmen fue muy complicado obtener un cr\u00e9dito para este fin, sin embargo acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde le brindaron la asesor\u00eda y agilidad correspondientes que ella siempre busc\u00f3, ahora sabe que muchas personas estar\u00e1n involucradas en la obtenci\u00f3n de sus sue\u00f1os de ser una microempresaria exitosa y poder dar a sus hijos la educaci\u00f3n que ella no pudo obtener y verlos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia. ","en":"Carmen, 37, has two children who attend public school.  It was hard for Carmen to have to face the responsibility of educating her children alone after separating from her husband of many years.  Nevertheless, she didn't allow the negative circumstances to affect her life, and she has gotten ahead with her children and her effort.\r\n\r\nCurrently Carmen lives with her two children in Quinind\u00e9, a canton in Esmeralda Province that provides several cities in Ecuador with products such as bananas, cacao, coffee, African palm, and forest products.  In addition, the majority of the residents work in daily commerce so they can get ahead, especially since they have expanded the roads to this canton.  This allows a lot of commercial mobility, particularly on the weekend when all types of merchants come out to sell their products at the fair to potential customers, mainly farmworkers.  Tourism is also a a very important contribution of this canton because its natural ecosystem has a variety of places to visit: waterfalls, fresh water rivers, and forests that have flowers and animals that adorn this city.\r\n\r\nCarmen has farmed a plot of land at her house for eight years.  She grows cacao, a product that's considered one of the most significant symbols of Ecuador, one of the main exporters of cacao.  Carmen's job is planting the seeds, and when they bear fruit she arranges for its sale in the market and to families.  After a period of fermentation, the seeds produce the cacao, which is used to make the most delicious chocolate anyone has eaten.\r\n\r\nOnce dried, the cacao beans are toasted in a frying pan and then peeled.  Next, the beans are ground to a powder.  Nevertheless, before this whole process, farm care is also very important.  This is why Carmen's requesting a loan to buy soil amendments to give her crops quality care and produce a bean with the characteristics her customers are looking for.  It was very complicated for Carmen to obtain a loan for this.  Nevertheless, she went to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa where they gave her the advice and diligence she always sought.\r\n\r\nNow she knows that a lot of people will be involved in realizing her dream of being a successful micro-entrepreneur and being able to give her children the education she wasn't able to have and seeing them become excellent professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":551.74,"image":{"id":1375265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy soil amendments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quinind\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":84.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":93.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":95.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.96,"local_amount":82.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313802,"comment":null},{"amount":172.06,"local_amount":170.71,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":172.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814457,"comment":null},{"amount":74.96,"local_amount":74.37,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":74.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320631,"comment":null},{"amount":13.5,"local_amount":13.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856320,"comment":null},{"amount":208.26,"local_amount":206.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":208.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-24T17:14:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574716,"name":"Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roc\u00edo, tiene 52 a\u00f1os, es divorciada y vive junto a 03 de sus 04 hijos en su casa propia.

is 48 years old and a married woman. She has five children. One year ago she began a business of selling bedding. She buys bed sheets and covers in bulk from the market, and sells them to the people of her community at reasonable prices. She wants to see her business grow and carry out a new investment, but she needs capital. For this reason, she requested a loan of Rs 50,000.

Shafia\u2019s embroidery patterns are very popular on her street, and she is the best earning resource in her household. \r\n\r\nShafia is a mother of six children; two of her daughters also assist her in making beautiful patterns. She wants to grow her business, so she requested a loan of Rs. 30,000 to buy fabrics, along with some spools of thread and packs of pearls and beads in various colors. This will help her to complete the orders of her customers on time. \r\n\r\nShe expects a boost in her earnings and dreams to open her own shop in the market to display her work.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.84,"image":{"id":1373856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy fabrics, along with some spools of thread and packs of pearls and beads in various colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Khan Pur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shafia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2123},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2185},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2249},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2315},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2383},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2524},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2598},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2832},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2913}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":2123,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2268.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381736322,"comment":null},{"amount":23.67,"local_amount":2185,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2335.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390823597,"comment":null},{"amount":24.36,"local_amount":2249,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2403.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399843806,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":2315,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2474.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410118712,"comment":null},{"amount":25.82,"local_amount":2383,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2546.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419883978,"comment":null},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":2452,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429532563,"comment":null},{"amount":27.35,"local_amount":2524,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2697.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439756393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-23T21:43:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573816,"name":"Samina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samina is a 31-year-old vigorous lady; she has been stitching clothes for many years.

Ever since she started this business she has worked on her own.  She started 5 years ago, and has seen that this is a very profitable business because it generates a good income for her that she uses to help cover her expenses and those of her family. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, she started selling shoes and other items such as toys and accessories for children.

is 58 years old. He lives in a small village of Sagarejo District, with his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Avtandil requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard, and a plot of agricultural land where plum trees are grown. They sell the harvested products locally, at a good price. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNow, Avtandil has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Avtandil has been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products.
