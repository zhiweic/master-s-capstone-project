To do so, she will buy bricks, cement, sand, rebar and other supplies as well as pay the builders.  Delma\u2019s dream is to improve her income so she can move into a house under the \u2018anticr\u00e9tico\u2019 modality [transaction whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner could lose the property to you] to provide her children with more comfort.  This is her first loan request to both Impro and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1204906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase bricks, cement, and sand to build an additional room in her parent's home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":48,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T21:30:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T21:30:19Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":82.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.91,"local_amount":77.91,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":77.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315423384,"comment":null},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":78.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T10:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":78.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323028274,"comment":null},{"amount":79.98,"local_amount":79.98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":79.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331164483,"comment":null},{"amount":81.18,"local_amount":81.18,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339547034,"comment":null},{"amount":82.38,"local_amount":82.38,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":82.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T00:49:48Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479562,"name":"Samuel Nigo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a 38-year-old businessman who lives in Juba.

He grows corn and beans. He has worked in agriculture for several years and he has gotten valuable experience, which allows him to obtain the best crops. When he's not working on his crops, he works as a day laborer and a bricklayer, because this helps him pay for his household expenses. The plot of land where he sows is located in a highly agricultural area that's very close to his home. He makes his sales in all the neighboring areas and he has gotten a lot of customers. His customers prefer to go to him because everything he sells is high quality at accessible prices, and he provides good service. Ismael is an active man who's dedicated to his work and has a lot of drive to get ahead. He's always seeking opportunities that allow him to succeed. He believes in working hard and persistently so that he doesn't give up halfway through. In the last few harvests he had many problems and losses, and he wishes to recover. He'll make a new investment which will allow him to increase production. For that reason he requests a loan from INTEGRAL so that he can purchase corn and bean seeds, fertilizer, insecticide, tools, etc. Ismael has a good credit record and he guarantees that he'll be able to repay the debt. At the same time, he hopes that he'll bring financial stability to his

The city is charismatic because the people who live there are very cheerful.  They perform a lot of traditional Peruvian dances such as el festejo, la zamacueca, land\u00f3, etc.  Alfredo really enjoys researching exotic plants but what he most enjoys is caring for animals.  For this reason, he is studying for a degree in veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\nAlfredo works in his small business growing chrysanthemums.  He works around 6 hours a day as he shares his time between work and his studies.  He believes that his business is doing well because he is very friendly with his customers and because he sells good-quality products.\r\n\r\nAlfredo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help that they provide, he will be able to buy manure for his flowers.  He will also be able to prepare his land to sow more chrysanthemums.  This means he will have more to sell and he will be able to improve his customer service.  He will be able to continue working hard to fulfill his biggest dreams: to finish his degree and to grow his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1210034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilizers, and to prepare the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-10-08T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-07T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":155.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":169.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":176.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":184.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.37,"local_amount":150.93,"processed_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":156.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345639,"comment":null},{"amount":62.35,"local_amount":155.87,"processed_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954868,"comment":null},{"amount":65.33,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":169.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089271,"comment":null},{"amount":67.69,"local_amount":169.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":175.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478809,"comment":null},{"amount":70.51,"local_amount":176.28,"processed_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031491,"comment":null},{"amount":73.75,"local_amount":184.38,"processed_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":191.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775987,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T11:08:33Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T11:17:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479591,"name":"Hanan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanan is a 41-year-old married woman who supports four family members.

Viven juntos en la Parroquia San Rafael que se encuentra en el Cant\u00f3n Otavalo de la Provincia de Imbabura. Otavalo es una ciudad muy atractiva por la diversidad de su cultura por lo que es muy concurrida por turistas nacionales y extranjeros quienes en cada visita disfrutan de paisajes, fiestas coloridas y las costumbres de sus habitantes ind\u00edgenas y mestizos que provienen de legendarias historias y que han defendido su territorio desde siempre. Es un cant\u00f3n muy rico econ\u00f3micamente pues desde sus antecedentes ancestrales, fue considerado el centro de la industria artesanal y actualmente estos productos son cotizados en todo el mundo.  Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una industria que aporta a la econom\u00eda de esta ciudad, pues en la zona rural se pueden encontrar r\u00edos, lagos, cascadas, bosques que son muy visitados. Por la afluencia de turistas, comerciantes y habitantes de la ciudad, en el centro de la ciudad se puede encontrar gran variedad de negocios que tienen el objetivo brindar todos los servicios para quienes pasan por la ciudad, estos negocios var\u00edan entre hoteles, hostales, restaurantes, cafeter\u00edas, papeler\u00edas, tiendas de ropa, alquiler de computadores, internet, etc. \nEs as\u00ed como Manuel emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de elaborar pan en horno de le\u00f1a desde hace 30 a\u00f1os cuando sus padres le insertaron el inter\u00e9s por la experiencia que ellos ten\u00edan. Manuel invierte cada d\u00eda m\u00ednimo 8 horas en la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de pan y tambi\u00e9n se las arregla para hacer alcanzar su tiempo con su actividad extra de crianza de animales dom\u00e9sticos.

A pesar de la falta de educaci\u00f3n, Manuel ha demostrado ser un buen administrador de su negocio y est\u00e1 seguro que la asesor\u00eda que brindan los ejecutivos de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa le ayudar\u00e1n a crecer con su negocio para que con los ingresos excedentes pueda tener un fondo de ahorro que le servir\u00e1 para cubrir necesidades de su esposa y de \u00e9l en los a\u00f1os de su vejez.

Otavalo is a city that\u2019s very attractive because of its diverse culture; it\u2019s very well-known by both national and foreign tourists who visit different vistas, colorful festivals and the culture of its indigenous and mestizo peoples that come from legendary histories and who have defended their territory since time immemorial. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an economically rich canton because it\u2019s been a center of craftsmanship since its most ancient origins and its products are today highly prized worldwide. Tourism is another industry that contributes to this city\u2019s economy because in this rural zone can be found rivers, lakes, waterfalls and forests that are highly visited. Because of the high number of tourists, merchants and residents in the city, one can find downtown a great variety of businesses that have as their main goal to offer all services to those passing through the city. These businesses range from hotels to inns, restaurants to cafeterias, bookstores, clothing stores, computer rentals, Internet access, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel started his business baking bread in a wood-burning oven 30 years ago when his parents injected him with interest in the experience they had.  Manuel spends a minimum of 8 hours daily baking and selling bread and he also finds the way to stretch his time to spend in his extra activity raising domestic animals.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAiming at keeping his family\u2019s tradition alive and to meet demand from his city\u2019s residents who always have a special preference for \u201cDon Manuel\u2019s\u201d bread, he tries to keep the business stocked with sufficient quantity to fill all orders placed.  Because of this, Manuel called on Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to find a loan whose funds will be used exclusively to buy flour and supplies to increase production.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his lack of formal education, Manuel has shown himself to be a good business manager and he\u2019s sure that with the guidance from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa executives he will be helped with the business so that he can use excess profits to start a savings account to cover his and his wife\u2019s old-age

La actividad que realiza Mar\u00eda es la venta de bebidas gaseosas y cocos. Tiene un puesto ambulatorio ubicado en el puerto pesquero de la ciudad en donde frecuentemente transitan personas en busca de refrescar el intenso calor que provoca las altas temperaturas. Instala una mesa con un congelador port\u00e1til y ah\u00ed coloca los productos que vende para su adecuada congelaci\u00f3n hasta el instante que el cliente viene a comprarle. Vende cocos pelados cuya pulpa es muy consumida o tambi\u00e9n vende el fruto entero que es solicitado por su deliciosa y fresca agua dulce. Lleva en este negocio m\u00e1s de 2 a\u00f1os y trabaja en ocasiones con la ayuda de su pareja. Comenta que lo que le agrada de su actividad son las ganancias que percibe diariamente ya que con este producto siempre tiene los ingresos econ\u00f3micos necesarios para apoyar a su c\u00f3nyuge con las gastos de su hogar, lo que no le gusta es que algunas veces algunos clientes le faltan el respeto cuando se encuentran en estado et\u00edlico, ya que lamentablemente en la zona donde trabaja existen muchos bares donde venden mucho licor, sin embargo, ha aprendido a manejar este tipo de situaciones y siempre logra salir airosa, espera conseguir un local donde pueda vender con mayor comodidad y donde tenga principalmente la seguridad de la que hoy carece. Este es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 3 con MFP, es por eso que agradece a todas las personas que hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar realizando su trabajo con mejores resultados. Por otro lado se compromete una vez mas a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte de su banco comunal por que todos los integrantes son personas responsables y muy solidarias. Con el monto solicitado de 1000 nuevos soles, los invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s gaseosas de distintas marcas, sabores y tama\u00f1os, adem\u00e1s comprar\u00e1 algunos art\u00edculos como sorbetes y bolsas para dar un mejor servicio en la venta de cocos. \n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda, who is 52 years old, is an entrepreneurial, hard working and very happy woman. She lives with her spouse, H\u00e9ctor, with whom she has only one child, but she has 5 children from her previous partner. She lives in her own home with four of her children, who are growing up and share with her the desire to create a better quality of life for the future, for each one of the family members. To earn income Maria sells sodas and coconuts. She has a transportable sales stand, located in the fishing port of the city, where people frequently pass by looking for something refreshing, due to the intense heat which is brought on by the high temperatures. \r\n\r\nShe has a table with a portable ice box which is where she puts the products she will sell, so that they are kept cold up until the point the customer buys them. She sells peeled coconuts, so that the meat of the fruit can be eaten, and she also sells whole coconuts which are requested for the delicious and fresh coconut milk. She has had this business for over two years. She sometimes has the help of her husband. She said that what she likes about her job, is the income she sees each day, because with this product she always has the necessary income to be able to support her spouse with the household expenses. What she does not like about her job is that sometimes she has customers who are disrespectful because they are intoxicated. Sadly, in the area where she works there are many bars where a lot of liquor is sold. However, she has learned how to handle these types of situations and she always succeeds in handling things gracefully. She hopes to find a location where she can sell more comfortably, that first and foremost offers the security she is currently lacking. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she has taken out through MFP. She is thankful to all of the people who make her loans possible, to continue working with improved outcomes. She promises, once again, to make her payments on time like she has done with her previous loans. She is also thankful to be a part of her communal bank, because all of the members are responsible and supportive people. With the amount of 1000 nuevos soles she has requested, she will invest in the purchase of more sodas, of a variety of brands, sizes and flavors. She will also buy straws and plastic bags, so that she can provide better service with her coconut sales.

His parcels of land were inherited from his parents, and they were the ones who taught him everything about the production of this crop. Now Pedro is 45 years old, and he is married to Magdalena, with whom he has three children. All the family works in this activity (farming). In the past harvest, Pedro had a production of 3 tons of coffee, which he delivered entirely to the Regional Union of Huatusco so that it could be processed and exported. For the next harvest, Pedro needs to buy fertilizer for his fields, and this is why he is applying for a loan. Pedro hopes that within two years his land will be producing twice the amount of coffee, since he has already planted new plants.

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds.

","en":"Horacio is a young, 21-year-old man.  He is single.  Because of the customs and traditions of the community to which he belongs, he only studied through primary school.  He lives in the canton of Santo Domingo in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.  Santo Domingo connects the mountain region with the costal region of Ecuador.  It is a city that has become a main commercial artery with various sectors of growth.  As proof, it has various enterprising families that started small businesses several years ago, and now they are small businesspeople that support the generation with employment.  Studies reveal that the businesses, for the most part, started empirically and have had acceptance due to tourists, businesspeople, and travelers passing through.  They are moving from one region to another, and it is also the third most populous city in the country.  Horacio lives in the Luz de Am\u00e9rica parrish in this canton, a sector that is considered the entryway to the province.  The richness of its land has been the birthplace of various food companies.  It is also the area that produces the most papaya and exotic fruit for export.  This is why the large majority of people in this parrish make a living through agriculture.\r\n\r\nHoracio always helped his parents with their bueinss and also got involved in his business.  Every day, he invests at least six hours in taking care of his crops and fruit.  Horacio is sure that his income can increase if he increases his work, which is raising chickens to sell.  This is why he requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where he found support with the speed and safety he was hoping for.  He also received advice on how to manage his business.  Horacio will use all of the funds from this loan to buy chickens as the first step in fulfilling his dream, which is to have a large farm so he can improve his quality of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1210045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

I really enjoy my business because it pleases me to see how my clients return because they were so well taken care of.  Although I have two employees working at the shoe store, I ask them to please treat the customers well so they will happily return to the store.

She started with her father whom taught her all the basics to carry out her work.  At the age of 20, Julia wed and had 3 girls and 2 boys who are now married.  It was difficult to raise her children after she widowed nearly 29 years ago and also had to care for her handicapped brother with Down Syndrome, however, she managed to get ahead with a lot of effort and help from her kids.  Her children are currently the ones in charge of carrying out the majority of the work on the coffee fields and Julia is in charge of supervising the work.  Julia hopes to obtain a loan so she can pay temporary workers for the upcoming harvest to cut the coffee, since the workload is too much for her children to do alone.  Amongst her many goals in coffee production, Julia would like to re-plant and purchase more plots of land to increase production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1210579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay worker's wages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6087.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936750,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

This is why she started her business of selling home items from a catalog.  She sells the items to her friends and acquaintances because she trusts them to pay the installment plan of her business.  She is currently seeking a loan from Vision Fund to purchase quilts, comforters, sheets, blankets, curtains, and towels on behalf of her customers' demands.  She also plans to sell to the teachers of her community because they have stable jobs and are paid twice per month.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosana oversees operations of their jeepney* transportation business. She has one, 14-16 person capacity, jeepney for which she is paid boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosana dreams to have another jeepney and hopes to give her children a good quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney: open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

On this occasion, we are visiting her so that she can tell us about her business.  Graciela says that she is 38 years old and has been married to Jes\u00fas for 20 years.  Together they have formed a family with five children who attend school.  In addition to having the children as dependents, they are also responsible for Jes\u00fas' mom as she is elderly and widowed.  Graciela tells us \"I have a butcher's shop which is a business I started together with my husband one year and ten months ago.  We started it because my father-in-law used to have a butcher's shop and it was a good butcher's shop.  However, when he died it passed into my brother-in-law's hands.  My husband also wanted to set up his own butcher's shop and so we set one up.  We rent our business premises.  We started out with an old display case and a meat grinder.  We couldn't buy new furniture because it was all very expensive.  We gradually bought a meat saw, a new display case and a new freezer because the one that we had cost too much to run.  We bought all these items through loans.  We are requesting a new loan from Visi\u00f3n Found, so that we can make our last payment on the meat grinder.  We would also like to buy more cattle because recently they have become too expensive.  This is one of the biggest difficulties we face.  The price of cattle has shot up and often we can't pay for them immediately.  Very often we ask the cattle farmer if he can wait a certain amount of time before we pay him.  Some cattle farmers are very understanding of the fact that we can't pay immediately but we have also met farmers who are not understanding and we have to pay them immediately with what we have available.  This means that we often have to request loans.  However, we have been able to get by and we have improved our business a lot because when we started out we only used to slaughter one or two animals a week.  Now we are killing three or four animals a week.  We have managed all this as a result of my husband's experience as he learned the business when he was very young, when he was 15 years old.  My husband has always encouraged us to work very hard and work a lot so that we can make progress with our business.  We always try to provide a very good service to our customers.  We try to be very humanitarian with them.  We make sure that the cattle farmers who sell us their animals do not sell us animals that have been raised with Clembuterol because we know that this is very bad for our customers.  We do not want to lose customers and so we try not to raise our prices so that our customers don't feel a sharp blow to their wallets.  We do this because we understand that very often they don't have enough money to buy more food.  We hope to eventually have two further butcher's shops where we will have employees.  We want to help people who really need a job.

She is married to Arnulfo, a driver, and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while also operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAna oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one-unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, for which she is paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day. To help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts, as well as for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAna dreams to have her own house and lot and hopes to give her children a good quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, which is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1208786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

is from a small village of the Akhmeta district. She is 60 years old and lives with her husband and two grown sons. Eteri is a pensioner. Her elder son takes wood from the forest and sells it in his village and nearby villages. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they run a small dairy farm of four milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Eteri produces cheese products and sells them at the local open market. In addition, the family owns a vineyard and agricultural land where maize is grown. They do all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. The harvested production is sold locally.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan to purchase food for the cattle.

Her main challenge is some customers not paying on time and a seasonal business climate.\r\n\r\nMutindi is applying for a loan of 36,650 Kenya shillings to purchase some flour, sugar, cereals, cooking oil and other equipment for the cafe. The extra income from the loan will be added to her savings to improve her living standards.

She plans to use the loan to buy rice, beans, sugar, salt, cooking oil, sweets, soft drinks, canned goods, flour, toilet paper, and toothpaste.  She wants to restock her business and continue with her sales.  She hopes that her business continues growing.  That way she will be able to give her son more education, and she will be able to give him the opportunity to study for a career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7350,"image":{"id":1209118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grocery store items to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Corrales, Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-09T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-08T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":7350,"lender_count":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":94000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":11750},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":918.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392185,"comment":null},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120047,"comment":null},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068094,"comment":null},{"amount":1837.5,"local_amount":23500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":23550.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284832,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-19T18:43:18Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479939,"name":"Scott","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Support a NY born and raised film entreprenuer!

He began farming when he was very young.  \u201cI\u2019ve been farming for 30 years and a lot of good and bad things have happened, but I learn from all of it,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nHe mostly grows peas, potatoes, and gladiolas, and small amounts of corn and barley.  He says that a crop is very profitable and he should take a risk and invest.  One of his difficulties is his lack of capital, but that he was able to overcome it thanks to MFP and your help.\r\n\r\nHis next goal is to open a shop with his son, so that they can specialize in installing irrigation systems.  For now he is focused on planting peas and corn so that he can continue making money.  He needs this support to achieve these objectives.  This will be his 15th loan through MFP and he is very grateful for so much confidence.  He serves as the secretary for the \u201cSanta Cruz de Patay\u201d communal bank and feels comfortable with all his fellow members.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will allow him to acquire some sacks of organic fertilizer and guano to guarantee his future corn and pea crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1210586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

She is a very amiable person.  When we arrived at her business, she began by telling us that she is 46 years old.  She is a very hard-working woman, and she has three children who are in school.  She is separated from her husband.  She tells us that she has always lived in her community, since she was born and to this day.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a personal loan to buy fireworks.  In addition to this business, she also sells children\u2019s clothes.  When we visited her to take the photo, she still did not have the fireworks merchandise.  That is why it is not in the photo with her merchandise and that the photo is of her clothing stand.  Her order arrives days later in order to start working with them at the start of November.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she has been working with fireworks for 18 years.  Her friend and Godmother of her children taught her this work, but unfortunately, she died.  She was the one who gave her the idea; she was a wholesaler.\r\n\r\nFelipa buys the fireworks and sells them by herself.  She tells us that she invests part and her income doubles.  Therefore, she has no large problems, and it always goes very well for her.  \r\n\r\nIt is only at this time that there is a big family problem.  Two of her children went to the United State two years ago, and she does not see them.  She is very sad and in despair about this.  She would like to see them again one day.  She only asks God to keep them well.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of all of this, she continues to be motivated by her three children who go to school.  She wants all of them to continue studying.  Felipa is very proud because she was not able to go to school.  However, she would like her children to be successful.  She says that as long as she is able to give them an education, she will do

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 900 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVioleta hopes that her business will expand soon, and she dreams of helping those in need.

The inspiration for her product, The Twinkle Curtain\u2122, came after she had her first child and started experimenting with curtain design at home. After seeing her curtains, Joanna\u2019s friends became interested in purchasing them so she began selling small batches. She has recently begun taking small batch orders at boutiques in New York and has received orders from online retailers. In response to these orders, Joanna started producing larger quantities of the product. Joanna feels lucky to have the support of her friends and family who are helping her with production expenses, but is seeking a loan to finish paying for the remaining production costs to cover the orders and prepare for new distributors. Joanna hopes that one day she can dedicate her entire time to work on her passion and spend time with her husband and two
