Sanobar has three children, but as she herself says, \"I have dozens of children, not just three.\"  Sanobar loves her students like her own children.  Her income from teaching used to be enough, but in the last few years, the need for additional income has arisen.  Her children are growing up and there are many expenses.  Because of this, Sanobar decided to go into the animal husbandry business in addition to her work as a teacher.  \r\n\r\nSanobar needs to save up money for her children's education.

Now, the lessons and habits she learned from her father are Firuza's source of income.  For 30 years now, she has been \"bringing home the bread\" from her work in animal husbandry.  She also works as a farm laborer, from which she gets vegetables, greenery, and fruit for her family's regular diet.  \r\n\r\nBecause of some temporary financial difficulties, Firuza decided to apply to MDO Arvand for a loan, trusting in her future income and prosperity.  Firuza wants to use the loan to buy cattle.  She is grateful in advance to MDO Arvand for its help and support.

His loan request was approved, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

The local farmers have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families. \r\n\r\nBoth Beatrice and her husband are farmers, and they have three children. She has been farming for forty-two years, and is currently growing oranges on her land. She is excited to work with Honey Care Africa because their hive technicians give very good service and teach people about beekeeping. She is also looking forward to eating some honey from her hives.

is 30 years old.

They have 4 milk cows, 5 calves, a bull and 2 pigs. They also own a vineyard. The family milks the cows to make dairy products and also sells piglets. From the harvested grapes, they make wine and vodka. They have a truck and use it for distributing all the products locally at the markets.\r\n\r\nMirza requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor. The rural poor do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Mirza wants to open a cement workshop to make cement blocks.

Vazha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is from real estate. Vazha owns a commercial space in the center of Borjomi which is rented. However, the rental amount is not enough to cover the family's monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan programs envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products and being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Beekeeping is somewhat new to Kwale, but the passionfruit farms and mangrove forests throughout the area provide excellent sources of nectar for bee colonies. Many farmers  in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nSamuel is married and has nine children. He has been farming for 50 years and is currently growing cashew nuts. He is excited to work with Honey Care Africa because they handle hive inspections and harvesting so he doesn't have to get stung by bees.

Her loan request was approved as a part of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

He uses his own minivan and his wife executes the role of conductor.\r\n\r\nThe house Mr. Sukhbaatar and his family live in has vulnerable external windows, walls and doors.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, about four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is lauded by  Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\" It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (it experienced an 8.0 earthquake in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011) as well as for its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives. It is also known, perhaps above all else, as the source of Peru's traditional national drink, Pisco. \r\n\r\nArmando's house and business are found in this hot and dry climate. In his free time, he likes to listen to music. In addition, since Peru is known for having some of the most delicious food in the world, one of Armando's favourite dishes is \"lomo saltado\" (a kind of stir-fried beef). Armando studied until the fifth year of secondary school but he would have liked to have studied law. He is a single father and has 2 children in primary school whom he loves very much.\r\n\r\nArmando works as a taxi driver and spends about 15 hours a day working.

Mirna has bought and sold new clothing for three years in the various hamlets near her community.\r\n\r\nCholuteca, Honduras, January 2013\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1895.83,"image":{"id":1302432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:05Z","loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia Yossely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.59},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":379.17,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7537.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364624729,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373203443,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382015513,"comment":null},{"amount":189.59,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390877895,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T16:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399914281,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410196877,"comment":null},{"amount":189.59,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419960299,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429614184,"comment":null},{"amount":189.58,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3768.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840636,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T20:48:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":532616,"name":"Makarimal Akhlakh Gpe 25 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Makarimal Akhlakh GPE  25 est un sous-groupe mixte  de Makarimal Akhlakh(groupement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique ) compos\u00e9 d'un homme et de 9 femmes qui pratiquent la m\u00eame activit\u00e9 de commerce.

She has been doing this for 8 years and it allows her to make an honest living.\r\n\r\nMaria is repeating her loan because it's the only way that she can get ahead. She currently has more than 200 chickens and needs a loan to buy food and medicine for them because they get sick a lot during this season and she doesn't want any losses.

In the past twelve years, she has been selling milk and baby calves to the local market of a nearby main city.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom morning till night this activity keeps me busy; milking, cleaning up the stable, feeding and preparing\/storing food for my animals, going to the market and by the time I get home in the evening, I feel exhausted. Even though it is the same routine every day, and I get bored and overtired at times, I keep doing it because I have no other choice. I need an income and this keeps me going,\u201d Bardhe said.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":638.26,"image":{"id":1304985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To
