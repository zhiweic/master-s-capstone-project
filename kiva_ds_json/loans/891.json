He requests this loan to invest it in the sowing of more coffee plants and the purchase of fertilizers, since he needs that to improve the plantation and get a good harvest. The loan would help him a great deal since previously he had to compromise the harvest with intermediaries who take advantage and pay the coffee at a really low price and charge very high interests. Marco's greatest desire is to introduce the use of modern technology into the plantation in order to raise his profits and improve his home's finances. This is his first loan with FAMA and he hopes to make the repayments he committed to do, in time"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1104636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to grow coffee and fertilize the plantation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Trojes, El Paraiso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:49Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T07:01:49Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marco Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-27T08:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20007.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347061940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-24T00:11:04Z","paid_date":"2013-03-27T08:32:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":431739,"name":"Benkadi 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 10 membres du groupe  Benkadi 1 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 37 ans, 5 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 Djollo Kagoua, un des villages de San, 4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur cinqui\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est le ma\u00efs  avec  KADIATOU,  2 eme debout de la gauche vers la droite  sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte acheter des intrants, des semences, des petits mat\u00e9riels agricoles et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir 1,5 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et au march\u00e9 de San, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 250.000FCFA en fin de campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.\n","en":"The 10 members of the Benkadi 1 group are married women with an average age of 37 and an average of five children who all live in traditional families in the village of Djollo Kagoua, located in San, the fourth administrative region of Mali.\r\nThey are cooperating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso so that they can successfully carry out their agricultural activities during the rainy season.\r\nThey are requesting their fifth loan with the institution.

It started nine years ago. These are women who were able to suceed in spite of any obstacles that came their way. Proof of that is Mrs. Jacinta president of the group Active Women. She is 52 years old, has a partner, and has four grown-up children. Every day she works hard in the grocery store that has provided an income for more than seven years. She started this business because she did not have enough money to cover household expenditures. She built a grocery store in her home and day by day spends more hours of her free time selling cosmetics. She will use the loan to buy groceries. Mrs. Jacinta is only one of 6 members who work hard and with enthusiasm for their families' well-being.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1106716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"buy

la venta de comidas en los pueblos, actividad que le permiti\u00f3 ahorrar para iniciar la tienda actual. Anteriormente viv\u00eda en otro sector de la ciudad, pero se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de trasladarse por problemas que hab\u00eda en el sector. Con mucho esfuerzo ha levantado su hogar y debido a que no tiene historial crediticio le ha tocado recurrir a pagadiarios, a quienes les prestaba dinero pagando el 20% de inter\u00e9s mensual. Roberto es muy conocido en el sector por tener un gran carisma. Gracias a que su tienda general es la \u00fanica en el sector le permite tener muy buenas ventas, por esto requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos de la canasta familiar que ya se encuentran agotados, adem\u00e1s de comprar una vitrina.\n\nDe esta manera Roberto espera poder iniciar con un historial crediticio que le permita tener en un futuro un mejor acceso a las entidades financieras, adem\u00e1s de poder tener su negocio bien surtido. Su mayor anhelo es tener un minimercado dado el potencial de clientes que hay en el sector, y as\u00ed generar m\u00e1s ingresos para su familia y tambi\u00e9n generar empleo para los m\u00e1s necesitados. \n","en":"Four months ago, Roberto started up a general store business in his town, taking advantage of his 12 years of experience selling food in the towns.  It was this food business that allowed him to save up the money to start up the store he has now.  Before, he lived in another neighborhood in the city, but he saw the need to move because of problems in that neighborhood.  It took a lot of effort for him to move to a new home, and since he didn't have a credit history he had to resort to the informal lenders, paying a monthly interest rate of 20 percent.  Roberto is very well-known in the neighborhood as he is quite charismatic.  Thanks to his general store, which is the only one in the neighborhood, he is able to have very good sales.  He needs a loan for this business so that he can buy consumer staples that he is out of, and he will also buy a glass display case.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Roberto hopes to start a credit history that will allow him better access in the future to financial entities.  Also, he will be able to keep his business well-stocked.  His main wish is to have a mini-market, given the potential with the customers that are in his neighborhood.  In this way he could generate more income for his family and also generate jobs for those in greatest need.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1106752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy consumer staples and a glass display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:51Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T07:01:51Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89348},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91849},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94421},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97065},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99783},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102577},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105449},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108401},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111437},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114557},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117765},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121062},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124452},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127936},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131519},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135201},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138987},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142878},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146879},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150991},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155219},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159565},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164033},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168626}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432063,"name":"Jaime Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaime es un joven emprendedor que desde muy temprana edad viene trabajando en una carnicer\u00eda como ayudante, y gracias a la experiencia que hab\u00eda adquirido decidi\u00f3 montar su propia carnicer\u00eda para progresar econ\u00f3micamente.

His goal is to come to have a small market where his customer can find all that they need. \r\n\r\nJuan has been a client of FAMA for more than 10 years and has been punctual with his payments.

She is 38 years old and married to Benito, who is a worker at a company which processes tuna and tuna products. They have 3 children, 2 boys and a girl, who attend secondary school and business school. Maricela tells us that she started as a helper in a restaurant where she earned 8 dollars a day, but her hours were only in the morning. This was convenient for her since she could care for her children, since they were young and she had nobody she could leave them with. In the afternoon she would go to the corner of her house with a small roaster and sold chicken wings, skewers, and ears of corn, collecting about 30 dollars a day. Little by little her business has been growing. Now she has a restaurant where she sells snacks to the employees leaving the company. She no longer works in the other restaurant. Maricela tells us that she opens only from Monday to Friday because she doesn't sell much on the weekend without workers. Currently she has a helper who works with her from 4 in the afternoon until 10 at night, which is when she sells the most. This is Maricela's 4th loan and for D-Miro it is a proud example of success. We have faith in her success because together we have seen her advance, from the beginning with a simple stand outside of her house to the restaurant that we have now. She asks us for another loan to adapt the business and to have money for the business.

She sells new and used clothing. Her business has existed for more than 3 years, and is well-known by many people in her neighborhood. Melisa is very hard-working, business-minded, intelligent, and responsible. A few years ago, she decided to start her clothing business because she is a single mother, and it is the main source of income for her family. Every day she wakes up very early to do all of the household chores, take care of her family, and then attend to her business. Many people prefer her business because Melisa is a very friendly and responsible woman, but most importantly, her customers always find what they are looking for at the best prices. Her dream is to be able to build her inventory to increase sales, and in this way, be able to increase her income and better support her family.

Nos comenta que siempre a vendido productos de belleza ya que le gusta tener dinero para cubrir sus gastos, adicional le da tiempo de cuidar a su hijo. Esto lo realiza todos los d\u00edas visitando a familiares y amigos ofertando perfumes, cremas, lapiz labiales, desodorantes en la ma\u00f1ana y tarde. Dolores nos cuenta que a pesar de esta hubo un tiempo que necesitaba ingresos y como su familia le dec\u00eda que cocinaba rico decidi\u00f3 empezar a vender comida preparada. Antes lo hac\u00eda solo a conocidos y bajo pedido pero no le dejaba mucha ganancia. Hace 1 a\u00f1o decidi\u00f3 hacerlo para el p\u00fablico y ha tenido muy buenos resultados. Esto solo lo realiza en las noches porque vende meriendas, el puesto lo saca en la parte frontal de su casa. Dolores nos comenta que como ambos negocios los realiza sola su mayor preocupaci\u00f3n seria enfermarse ya que se paralizar\u00eda ambos negocios y no tendr\u00eda con que cubrir sus gastos. Espera no verse en ese problema ya que necesita el prestamo  para comprar productos como perfumes, maquillaje, desodorante, sombras etc., invertira en este negocio porque es con el que tiene mayor rentabilidad y podria cubrir las cuotas. La meta de Dolores es poder comprar una vitrina donde exponer los productos que vende.","en":"Dolores is 48 years old.  She sells cosmetics through catalogs and fast food.  Dolores lives in Libertad at the home of her parents since she is already separated from her spouse.  She has a son who attends a state school, which is why she manages two businesses.  Dolores says that she has always sold beauty products because she likes having income to cover her expenses, but it also gives her time to take care of her son.  Every day she visits with relatives and friends in the mornings and afternoons to offer them perfumes, cr\u00e8mes, lip pencils, and deodorants.  Despite the time that is required of her to generate needed income, Dolores says she decided to begin selling prepared foods because her family said that her cooking was delicious.  \n\nAt first Dolores only sold to people she knew, which resulted in few orders and very little profit.  A year ago, she decided to sell to the public and now has very good results.  At night she works alone selling snacks from a stand set up in front of her house.  Dolores says she operates her two businesses by herself, so her greatest worry is that a serious illness would paralyze both ventures and she would have no means of covering her expenses.  She hopes to avoid this problem and expects to secure her loan and cover all the required payments.  Dolores hopes to invest in products for her business, such as perfumes, makeup, deoderant, powder, etc. She will invest in this business because it is the most profitable and she can cover her expenses. Dolores' goal is to be able to purchase a glass case to display the items that she sells.

is in her early fifties and married.

They wake up extremely early in the morning to go to the field, feed and milk animals... While you drive by, you see all these people with straw hats covering their heads and plowing, planting & harvesting non-stop in the summer heat. They do so much hard labour.  She said, \"It would be very nice to live a peaceful life and without any hard labor. Yet, that's just a dream for us.\" \nHer family owns a few \"dynyms\" of fields and also a few goats. \nZhaneta has been VF Albania's client for the past six years and has proved to be a very responsible person, by paying off her loans on time and in full her monthly installments. At the moment, she is requesting another loan to add some more goats to the existing herd. The demand for goat cheese is high and she has a steady clientele. \nShe thanks VFA and Kiva lenders for their understanding.

These teachers have applied for a loan of 16,100,000 Sierra Leonean Leones (SLL) from SMT\/Kiva lenders. School staff from this institution, like many other school staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar (treasurer) is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf. Tejan is a head teacher at the school and leader of this group. Tejan is married to a small scale businesswoman and the couple has children attending primary and secondary schools. Tejan has been a teacher for 19 years now. He has requested this loan in order to invest in agriculture.

","en":"Tukhta was born in an educated and intellectual family. She has worked with selling dry fruits, more precisely dried apricots, for many years. Currently her husband is immigrating to the Russian Federation, and therefore the burden of caring for the three children and the family economy lies on her shoulders. \r\n\r\nTukhta has already been buying and selling dried apricots for 12 years. At the start of every year she rents an apricot orchard with many trees. She dries and treats the apricots together with her children and sells them at a high price.

She has spent many years working in agriculture and has a lot of experience in this field, which has enabled her to achieve improved harvests. The plot of land is located in an area with an agricultural impact, near to her home. She sells in all neighboring areas and has already got a large, permanent, customer base because they know that everything she sells is of an excellent quality and at low prices, moreover, she is known for her friendliness. \r\n\r\nCarolina is a visionary woman who is keen to get ahead in order to have a brighter future. In the last harvest, she suffered losses due to the poor weather that is why this harvest she hopes to recover her losses. She wants to buy supplies, but she needs capital which is why she has sought a loan from Integral to buy corn seeds, beans, herbicides, fertilizers and tools, etc. Carolina Marisol has a good credit history and an excellent repayment record, which is why she states that she will be able to repay the loan, at the same time as offering her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1111300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy corn seeds, beans, herbicides, fertilizers and tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-07-01T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-31T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":4.86,"local_amount":4.86,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331925709,"comment":null},{"amount":57.22,"local_amount":57.22,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":57.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347003999,"comment":null},{"amount":41.26,"local_amount":41.26,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":41.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448394,"comment":null},{"amount":89.21,"local_amount":89.21,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":89.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451706,"comment":null},{"amount":107.45,"local_amount":107.45,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":107.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082976,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-02T00:21:49Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:08:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":434699,"name":"Korto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Korto is married, 30 years old, and lives in Airport Community with her husband and children.
