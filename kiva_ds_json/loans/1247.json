She works at a government organization.  It was very hard for her to provide the children with all of the necessities because she earned a small salary.  At the present time, her sons have grown up and started to work in the Russian Federation.  She is gradually able to improve living conditions with the help of the children.  Mohiniso has to purchase airline tickets for her sons, but because she does not have enough money, she requested a loan.

They used an amount of 150,000 som (KGS) as a start-up capital. After having managed to develop the business and to find returning customers, Anara had an average income of 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to persistent work with the business, the couple managed to purchase the vulcanizing equipment they had previously rented. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further improve and develop her business, Anara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase tires wholesale to subsequently sell. Anara plans to invest the income from the loan in increasing the working capital and save money for buying a house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":298.07,"image":{"id":1456369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase tires for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7079},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7286},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7498},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":7717},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7942},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8174},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8412},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8657},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8910},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9170},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9437},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":9718}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":146.89,"local_amount":7079,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7141.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427130,"comment":null},{"amount":151.18,"local_amount":7286,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7350.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942672,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-25T23:29:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622572,"name":"I Wayan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I Wayan is getting a new loan of 7M IDR, which he will use to buy piglets and fix his car. \r\n\r\nPig rearing has been shown to increase the family's income.

She has been able to carry out various small projects for her family, using the profit from her business. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will serve her to buy materials (8 meters of cloth, 12 packets of thread, 5 meters of golden brown fringe, etc.) In this way, she hopes to keep her children in school and build a nice house out of durable materials. Debtors and selling on credit are the challenges for the development of her business. Finally, she would like to thank Hekima sincerely for its support with micro-loans dedicated to small entrepreneurs who cannot be served by banks, during this critical period of war.

He has two buffaloes for this work. He sells their milk door to door and in the main market. By doing so, he generates income for fulfilling his family's needs. His current net income is not enough to cope with the daily and monthly needs of his family. He has lots and lots of expenses to pay for, such as electricity bills, gas and water bills, the children\u2019s school fees, food expenses and also the buffaloes\u2019 upkeep and their food expenses. So, he is planning to purchase one more buffalo to increase his selling.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he is interested in purchasing one more buffalo to grow his business, but he finds it difficult due to financial constraints. Ashiq has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. He will use the loan amount to purchase a buffalo. This will not only help him to increase his milk selling, but will increase his net income and savings as well. He hopes to provide quality education for his children. He is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Ashiq is standing with one of his buffaloes at the farm where he keeps the buffaloes.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.95,"image":{"id":1455418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a buffalo in order to increase his milk sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashiq","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":13933},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":14378},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":14839},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15313},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15803},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16309},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16831},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":17370},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":17926},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18499},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":19091},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":19708}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.74},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":132.36,"local_amount":13933,"processed_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T12:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":14030.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429452441,"comment":null},{"amount":136.59,"local_amount":14378,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":14478.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439671724,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T19:46:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625051,"name":"Arsenio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Arsenio, es carpintero, fabrica todo tipo de variedad de muebles para el hogar, comenta que se dedica a este trabajo hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1o, es muy emprendedor  y d\u00eda a d\u00eda lucha para salir adelante.\nVive con su esposa y un hijo menor en su propia casa que pudo tener gracias a su trabajo.

Ishfaq is 45 years old. He lives in Pakistan with his wife, three sons and three daughters. He is an excellent cook. He owns a food stall in the market, the only source of income for the family. He sells tasty and delicious food like fried rice, mixed vegetables, beef etc. His customers love the food he offers. His income is too low to cover their household expenses.\r\n\r\nPresently, he is in need of purchasing oil, eggs, pulses (lentils), beef, rice and variety of vegetables for preparing food.

He loads milk cans on his bicycle and delivers them early in the morning. His customers like the fresh and delicious milk he delivers. His monthly net income is too low to meet the household needs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he planned to purchase one more buffalo to increase his sales.

The school administration will pay for the service, and Badri will generate income. \r\n\r\nBadri and his villagers hope for your support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":403,"image":{"id":1455519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a mini-bus for transporting schoolchildren ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Didi Nedzi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-10-27T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-26T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Badri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":130.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":135.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":139.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":146.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":158.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":169.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":173.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":176.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":180.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":184.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.37},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":267.87,"local_amount":267.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":267.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255688,"comment":null},{"amount":135.13,"local_amount":135.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":135.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019813,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T16:47:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622716,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is a 57-year-old married woman with three children, one of whom is still in school.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSimplicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSimplicia dreams that her business will expand, and hopes that her family will always be in good health.

She ensures that she keeps customers that she has earned over the passing of time. \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with ID-Ghana, a Kiva partner, thanks to whom she has been offered the opportunity to access finances that offer her the security to continue with her work. On the other hand, she is committed to fulfilling her repayments in a punctual manner. With the requested amount of 1,600 GHS she will primarily buy sauce pans, rice cookers, blenders, and other items to sell to customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":317.86,"image":{"id":1453650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sauce pans, rice cookers, blenders and other items to sell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Teshie, Accra","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":231,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patience\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":133.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":136.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419875129,"comment":null},{"amount":126.14,"local_amount":269.1,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429523652,"comment":null},{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":275.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":281.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439747572,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T14:27:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622785,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is an 18-year-old single young man from Qalqilia city.

His wife takes care of the household.\r\n\r\nJose has been a farmer all his life, despite the fact that his mother never tried to put him in school. His father left when he was two years old. If he worked hard to have an honest career, he would be able to make a living. This is why Jose started a career in farming along with his mother and older sister. With them, he completed tasks of planting seeds, controlling weeds and infestations, and most importantly, completing the production process of harvesting. Since then, he hasn't stopped working in the field and has continued working to earn income for his family.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy materials to improve his home, which is in bad condition due to deterioration from storms in the past winter. For this reason, Jose needs to buy laminate to improve the roof of his home so it no longer leaks.\r\n\r\nJose's dream is to improve his family's quality of life.

So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Vahan and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1455744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for the harvesting services and to make previous credit repayments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Tsaghkunq village, Armavir region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T06:50:01Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vahan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":95.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":97.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":102.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":102.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":103.43},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":104.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":105.53},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":106.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":107},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":108.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110.12},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110.69},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":111.63},{"due_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":112.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.53},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.1},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.12},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622888,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is 43 years old and she lives in West Point.

All the family is engaged in the cultivation of wheat, tomato, peach and apricot. Knarik's husband and sons sell their agricultural products at the local market. Agribusiness are an important source of income for the family. In order to continue farming activities, Knarik needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase wheat seeds, pay for the harvesting services, pay for the workforce, buy fuel for agricultural machinery, and make previous credit repayments. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to the hard work recently, Knarik was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Knarik and her family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":355.54,"image":{"id":1455746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for wheat seeds, harvesting services, labourers, to buy fuel for agricultural machinery, and previous credit repayments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Goravan village, Ararat region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Knarik","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":115.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125.14},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":128.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131.9},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.32},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.9},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":241.39,"local_amount":241.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":241.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308666,"comment":null},{"amount":114.15,"local_amount":114.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":114.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845950,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T17:13:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622905,"name":"Asa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asa has really benefited from her previous loan.

Now we are happy to report that the group finished paying back the loan a few days ago. The women are grateful and satisfied with the progress, because their small businesses have either grown a little or have maintained the same level. Currently the 8 women of this trust bank are starting another loan cycle and they are asking again for funds through KIVA. \r\n\r\nJust as a reminder, these ladies are from a rural area in Guatemala full of agriculture fields, including the sweet crop of strawberries. In their last loan cycle we told the story of Rosa, who is doing great and is still part of the group. Now we want to share the story of Marta who is 34 years old and currently playing the role of secretary of the trust bank. \r\n\r\nMarta is married and has 2 children aged 8 and 5 years old. She and her family are farmers and they are dedicated to the cultivation of strawberries, starting about 7 years ago. However, they could not grow as much as they wanted, because they needed financial capital. That is when Marta decided to join Friendship Bridge with the intention of finding working capital. She was accepted into the Microcredit Plus program from Friendship Bridge, which includes a loan and training. Now Marta is starting her third loan cycle. The amount requested will help her to buy foliar fertilizer and organic fertilizer for her crops, so they can continue with production. Marta's family cultivates 4 acres of land and has potential clients to whom they deliver between 25 and 35 boxes of strawberries. This allows the working capital to move more easily affording the family a consistent income. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the cultivation of strawberries, Marta also plants corn, beans, and squash. These products are used for both the family's own consumption and for sale. This means that Marta has the ability to repay the loan each month. \r\n\r\nBoth Marta and the other women of the group, receive training on business administration, money management, women's health, children's rights, and health, among other issues that are part of the benefit of Friendship Bridge's micro-credit and education program that serves to increase the knowledge of these women.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":988.34,"image":{"id":1455802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds for strawberries and fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecp\u00e1n, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T11:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T11:10:02Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":203,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Odilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loida Celestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percida Hajaira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Encarnacion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3920},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3880}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":489.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":494.17,"local_amount":3920,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3935.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503434,"comment":null},{"amount":494.17,"local_amount":3920,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3935.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728418,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-16T02:38:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622927,"name":"Alafia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isatu is the featured leader of this group of two.

Four of them are currently in school. Rosa and her family live in rural Llanos del Pinal, Quetzaltenango in the western highlands of Guatemala, where many people are engaged in activities like agriculture and animal husbandry. Many women are also seamstresses. Rosa belongs to the community bank called CIELO (Heaven), along with 13 other women, who seek to develop themselves and their families. Besides agriculture, these ladies are also dedicated to sewing, growing and selling flowers, buying and selling all kinds of vegetables, breeding animals, etc.\r\n\r\nRosa and her family have been engaged in the farming industry for several years.  She decided to approach Friendship Bridge for a loan to increase the amount of land available for cultivation. Currently, she is starting her 6th loan cycle; Rosa is so excited to request a loan of 512 USD, which she\u2019ll use to buy seeds, fertilizer, and manure for a crop of 10 strings. Among the products they grow there are: onions, lettuce, carrots, and broccoli. Rosa and her family sell the vegetables to wholesalers in a large market located about 1 hour from their land. \r\n\r\nRosa's great desire is that her children could stay in school, so their future can be better than hers. She says that it's hard not knowing how to write in Spanish, even though she understands and speaks some Spanish. Currently two of her children are in high school on weekends so they can support the family during the week in the field. Also her two youngest children are in elementary school daily.\r\n\r\nRosa and the other women of the trust bank CIELO are grateful for the support and trust of KIVA investors. With the working capital they give, these ladies can make their small businesses grow and\/or maintain the same level. Their businesses are sources of income for them and their families.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":663,"image":{"id":1455809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy strawberries seeds, and to buy chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecp\u00e1n, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T12:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T12:00:01Z","loan_amount":3975,"lender_count":131,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Leonarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2627},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2603}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":331.5,"local_amount":2627,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2639.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503435,"comment":null},{"amount":331.5,"local_amount":2627,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2639.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T06:19:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622950,"name":"Alimamy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alimamy, in his late forties, is from Tombo in the western rural area of Freetown.

Although Andrei is very busy and works very hard, he cannot save up enough money to keep his house warm, which he and his family have long needed.\r\n\r\nTo do the repairs, Andrei needs 20,000 hriven to insulate the house, where the temperature gets unbearably low during the winter.

Mariela's father works as a farmer and his salary is the family's primary source of income.\r\n\r\nTo support her family and studies, Mariela currently works 30 hours a week in a bakery and has been doing so since the age of 16. One of her biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school.
