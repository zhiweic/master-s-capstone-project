His wife has the position of supervisor at a private business entity, and before this job she used to run a hock shop. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. So Sergelenbaatar is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as cement, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he can repair and insulate his old house. As a result, the family will reduce its coal consumption, thus releasing fewer pollutants which will contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She\u2019s married to Mart\u00edn who works as a field hand and they\u2019ve formed a family together; they have a son who is now attending school.  Isabel is very young but at her young age she works raising and selling pigs.  Isabel commented: \u201cEver since I was a girl my father encouraged me to care for these little animals; he\u2019d tell me that it was a good way to help my husband with household expenses.\u201d  Isabel has been in her activity for three years and she likes it very much, even more so when they are big and she can sell them although one of the difficulties for selling them at a good price is that often the hard work and effort that went into raising them isn\u2019t valued.\r\n\r\nIsabel buys the animals when they are little and cares for them for a few months.  It seems that feed for pigs is very expensive but without it her little piglets won\u2019t be able to grow big and strong.  This time she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy four pigs that she intends to sell whenever her family faces any economic problem like the one they are living through at present: her little boy has a strong eye infection and expenses are greater.\r\n\r\nIsabel commented with a smile: \u201cI\u2019d like to have better quality of life for my little boy so that someday he can have a good job and not suffer from any wants.\u201d  Isabel is sure that she\u2019ll be able to continue raising piglets to help her husband with household expenses.  \r\n\r\nAll the group members are very happy and grateful because each one of them will be able to invest in her business.  Patricia, Jessica, Alberta and Elvira will invest in pigs and Teresa in sheep.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1363827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

They were first used by American soldiers in helping the Philippines ward off the invading Japanese. Filipinos, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn money and modified the Jeep into a 20-seat jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been successfully running her business of selling ornamental items for six years.  \r\n\r\nNabeela has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She would purchase a large quantity and new varieties of bangles, bracelets, necklaces, key chains and other ornamental items and sell them at a profit. This could increase her sales, monthly income and savings and she could support her family in better way.

For that reason, as a member of 2-person borrower group she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase beauty products like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, make-up kits, hair colors and some other products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon.  \r\n\r\nZarqa dreams of llving a happy healthy and peaceful life with her family.

Her aunt works in the restaurant as a waitress. They both earn small monthly salaries, which is the only source of living for the family. \r\n\r\nTeona is requesting a loan from Credo to start a family business. She has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her loan,Teona will open an entertaining center. She will rent a room, renovate it as needed, and hire people who will be working as animators on private orders on call. There is not many of this kind of centers in Kutaisi district and Teona hopes this will help her to have a good numbers of clients. She will try to have all kinds of entertainments needed for birthdays or other celebrations to satisfy clients' needs and make her business successful. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family income and Teona will be able to improve their living

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Bachuki will rent a vineyard. The vineyard that he wants to rent already has grapes growing, so he will not have any extra expenses. Bachuki will harvest grapes and sell them at the local markets, at a good price. He hopes this will increase his monthly income and he will be able to provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.38,"image":{"id":1368608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land

They also have a booth, which is rented out for 100 GEL. Vakhtang has a car, and he drives it as a taxi to transport local people, to earn a small additional daily income. Vakhtang applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vakhtang has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With his credit, Vakhtang will buy a milk cow.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSalvacion hopes that her business is successful and dreams to have good health. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories about her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1368609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to pay for spare parts and to maintain her arcade and billiard set.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-06-12T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-12T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7404.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670159,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5288.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534689,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3173.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-12T18:07:57Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:54:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570413,"name":"Al Samraa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima, Mona, Nohad, and  Najah are four women who live in the same neighborhood and have been friends for a long time. Each of them has a financial need, which is why they decided to join hands and contact Al Majmoua to acquire a group loan. <p>\r\n\r\nFatima. the leader and featured member of Al Samraa group, is a 34-year-old married mother of two children; she is shown on the far right in the picture. Fatima owns a small business that sells facial creams, while her husband works in a small communication engineering shop (mobile phone maintenance and shop, etc.). They both earn barely enough to cover  their own expenses, which is a great obstacle in their desire to provide a good education for their children. In fact, their very low incomes forced their children to drop out of school. Fatima and her husband are waiting for their economic situation to improve in order to enroll their children in school again. She decided to request the loan because she needs to purchase merchandise for her business in order to expand the range of products she offers. <p>\r\n\r\nMona, a 28-year-old married mother of two children, is shown on the far left in the picture. She owns a hairdressing salon, while her husband is a taxi driver. Both her children are enrolled in a private school although they can barely pay for their tuition fees and their monthly expenses. Mona decided to join the Al Samraa group because her sister's wedding is coming up, and she has no means of buying a dress for that cherished event.<p>\r\n\r\nSeated second from the right in the picture is Nohad, a 40-year-old married mother of three children. Nohad owns a small business that sells Lebanese pastry, while her husband has his own winch. Their low income status does not allow them to lead a healthy life with their children. Nohad wishes to purchase an oven, and a mobile phone for her daughter, which is why she decided to request the loan.<p>\r\n\r\nNajah, a 32-year-old married mother of four children and seated second to the left in the picture, works in a small computer shop where her husband is also an employee.  Their combined revenue does not cover their monthly expenses,  and her children are not currently enrolled in school, awaiting an improvement of their parents' financial situation to improve before they go back. Najah needs the loan in order to start selling beauty creams and cosmetics for additional income.

Qubadiyon is located in the foothills, where there is good pasture land. Umed is planning to buy and sell cattle. Every month he will buy two calves, fatten them up over the course of a month, and then sell them at a profit. He already has a 5x3 meter cowshed and 800 TJS in savings.

Lia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLia\u2019s husband is an artisan. He is working on house renovations for private orders to earn a small income for the family. Their additional income is Lia\u2019s parents-in-law\u2019s monthly pensions. \r\n\r\nLia requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Lia will renovate the house in order to rent it out. Surami district is a tourist area in summer. It\u2019s popular for its beautiful nature and fresh air, so a lot of families go there for summer vacations. Lia will have the rooms to rent out and earn a good profit.  The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":460,"image":{"id":1367345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"To renovate the house in order to rent it out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bughaura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-12T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-12T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613723,"comment":null},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857435,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134083,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T01:47:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570418,"name":"Mariana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariana is a married woman with five children.

With a lot of drive to succeed, he came to this institution in order to request a loan, because sowing season has begun and he needs to start sowing as soon as possible. That's the reason why he requests the loan, since he needs to invest in the purchase of the farming supplies he needs, such as seeds, compost, insecticide, etc., so that he can sow. He has faith in God and in his work, and trusts that this way he'll succeed in reaping a bountiful harvest which will allow him to improve both his and his family's living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1368082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds, compost, insecticide, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Elizandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-10T02:49:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570475,"name":"Smaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Smaina is a 27-year-old married woman who lives with her husband and one child. \r\n\r\nShe has been running her own beauty parlor for many years.

He lives in Marneuli district with his wife, mother, brother and sister in-law. Elshan has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nElshan has a caf\u00e9. He sells cold drinks and beer and earns a small monthly income. His brother is an artisan of metal-plastic doors and windows and works on private orders. \r\n\r\nElshan requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Elshan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision for business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Elshan will purchase products to be able to serve food in his cafe.

She lives in a large family in the Lafiala district of the city of Koutiala. She has not had the opportunity to attend school, which explains her commitment to commercial activities.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting several activities she is currently involved in buying and selling saltwater fish. They are the most popular because they are affordable compared to freshwater fish.\r\n\r\nTo increase her sales, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution some years ago. After six solidarity loans (group loans) all repaid without difficulty, this is her second individual loan.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy 8 boxes of fish to store in case the supplier becomes out of stock, which happens very often. She conducts her sales by the roadside in the city of Koutiala, to a clientele composed of women and men, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make 90,000 FCFA profit per month, that she will use to repay loan interest to Soro Yiriwaso, meet her personal needs and invest the rest in her business activity.\r\n\r\nShe still depends on Soro Yiriwaso funding to expand and diversify her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":231.82,"image":{"id":1370030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"buy saltwater fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diarrah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678652,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924266,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207455,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972119,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624720,"comment":null},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":19042.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850742,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-16T12:16:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570173,"name":"Sonia Petronila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia de 60 a\u00f1os de edad, es originaria de la ciudad  de Managua , madre de 4 hijos todos mayores de edad.

is 57-years-old.

Her husband supports her in the business. The business takes a lot of effort, but together they run it successfully. She sells the meat in the central bazaar where the demand for meat is high. People in Azerbaijan consume plenty of meat because it is used in most dishes. Some traditional meals like kebabs, dolma and others require beef in their preparation. Her profit is 130 AZN monthly. Zashida is applying for new loan of 1,500 AZN in order to expand the business by buying new calves. She plans to raise these calves, fatten them, and sell more meat for the coming traditional holidays, when the demand for beef will increase.

She has three children who live with her in a wooden house which was built many years ago.  Maritza and her husband work as farmers, growing regional crops such as organic cacao and coffee.  In the past, Maritza used to sell livestock but she suffered a small accident which stopped her working temporarily.  She used some money that she had been saving up to buy a plot of farmland so that she could attempt to start improving her finances again.  Her work consists of keeping her crops in good condition so that she obtains good-quality harvests.  She normally uses organic fertilizer to increase the quality of her fruit.  She also hires local laborers to get rid of the weeds that grow constantly.  Maritza's work becomes more complicated when the rainy season arrives because she has clay soil and this prevents her from doing her daily tasks normally.  After harvesting her fruits at the end of the season, she dries them and, with the help of a truck, she transports the sacks of cacao to the city where she sells them to local buyers who pay her a good price.  Her main goal is to build her house from bricks and to provide her whole family with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is Maritza's first loan through Kiva.  She feels very grateful for the opportunity she is being given and pledges to make all her loan repayments on time.  She is requesting a loan for 2,500 soles to buy sacks of organic fertilizer with which to fertilize her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":798.35,"image":{"id":1368779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":282.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":286.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":294.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":304.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":317.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":326.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":340.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":348.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.49,"local_amount":282.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":285.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975840,"comment":null},{"amount":105.95,"local_amount":286.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":289.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997108,"comment":null},{"amount":108.82,"local_amount":294.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":297.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864578,"comment":null},{"amount":112.75,"local_amount":304.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":308.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352946,"comment":null},{"amount":117.42,"local_amount":317.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":321.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904713,"comment":null},{"amount":120.64,"local_amount":326.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":330.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090721,"comment":null},{"amount":128.28,"local_amount":346.71,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":350.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T12:55:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570583,"name":"Samuel Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet with this team of primary school teachers from Waterloo, a town in western Sierra Leone near the capital city of Freetown.

from Sierra Leone! This is 45-year-old Memuna from Waterloo, in the eastern area in Freetown. She is married with 4 children between the ages of 9 years and 18 years. Three of her children attend school. She started in business to get daily survival for her family.\r\n \r\nMemuna runs a food stand business where she sells cooking seasonings, groundnuts and peppers. She has been running this business since 2000. She works at the business 9 hours per day and 7 days per week.  Memuna says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities like cooking seasonings, oil, rice, groundnuts and peppers. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, she plans to expand her business more than ever. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.42,"image":{"id":1368864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She began her business because she wanted to help her community through medical care. She works at the business 7 days per week and 15 hours per day. She says that the main challenge to her business is the expiration of drugs.\r\n\r\nRugiatu requires a loan in order to buy medicinal drugs. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take good care of her family. In the future, she plans to build a clinic.

","en":"Tojiboy is a kindhearted fellow of 44. He is married and has one daughter. He lives with his wife and daughter out in the countryside. He earns a living running his own business. He is very experienced in raising cattle and farming. Most of his income comes from raising and selling livestock. His wife helps him with the business; in the afternoon, she works at a community farm, and in the evening and morning she looks after the animals and milks the cows. Each cow produces 10 liters of milk a day, and his wife sells it to people who live nearby. Along with raising animals, Tojiboy grows crops on a two-square hectare plot of land, and sells the harvest. This business brings him additional income. Now Tojiboy wants to increase his cattle herd to earn a large profit. His daughter is graduating from school and is going to enter the university, so Tojiboy needs money to pay for her education. Therefore he is requesting a loan to buy more cattle so he can resell them later on. Tojiboy thanks Arvand for its support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1361428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She and her husband have been making interior decoration to entities on contract for about 10 years and have accumulated a vast amount of experience. This year, due to the presidential election, the interior decoration orders are minimal, so they decided to renovate their old house using this spare time. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, they will repair and insulate their old house. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to reduce their coal consumption and release less pollutants, thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

Her husband is working in Russia. Mavluda is a very thoughtful, kind, and decent woman. She helps her husband to support the family. She makes homemade sausage using a recipe her grandmother taught her when she was young, and sells it at the district's main market. She also makes custom-ordered sausage. Even though this business is not very profitable, it is enough for her family and she has no complaints about it. Despite their small income, Mavluda and her husband have already married off their daughter. Mavluda is a young grandmother who babysits and spoils her grandchildren. Her son is studying at college and she needs to buy a computer for him. She also has to pay for his tuition. But she cannot afford it, despite the money that her husband sends to her. So Mavluda has requested a loan from Arvand. She is counting on their support and expresses her thanks in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":428.18,"image":{"id":1369417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to buy a computer and pay for  tuition ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavluda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":377.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":390.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":403.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":417.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":431.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":446.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":461.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":477.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":493.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":510.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":527.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":545.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":563.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":582.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":602.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":623.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":644.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.39},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80.02,"local_amount":377.89,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":380.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860006,"comment":null},{"amount":82.74,"local_amount":390.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":393.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136750,"comment":null},{"amount":85.54,"local_amount":403.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":407.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900945,"comment":null},{"amount":88.44,"local_amount":417.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":421.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550126,"comment":null},{"amount":91.44,"local_amount":431.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":435.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T15:22:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570682,"name":"Editha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Editha is 45 years old, married, and has five children.

Tapaswini has been running a bicycle repair business for the last twenty years with the help of her husband. Her husband also sells bicycle spare parts to his clients at reasonable rates.

Due to this situation, till now she has not been able to construct a good house for her family.  So these poor circumstances compel Tapaswini to search for a credit source for the expansion of her business. To fulfill her dream, In the year 2013 Tapaswini, along with other four poor women from her village, formed a Joint Liability Group named Bublen.
