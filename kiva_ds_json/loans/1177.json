Unfortunately, she is the only person working in the family and her salary is not enough to make ends meet for a family of four. \r\n\r\nIn the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make a living. So, she decided to start her own business with a loan. However, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Liana\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received credit through the joint initiative, the Kiva and Credo-Startup Program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 1,500 GEL, she will purchase beehives with bee-colonies. The family will start producing honey and will be able to increase its income. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKoba is involved in agricultural activities. He has a vineyard and produces wine for selling. In addition, he has a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKoba requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Koba has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Koba will purchase pigs and feed for them. After the pigs are purchased, he will fatten them and slaughter them in wintertime to sell meat. This will increase his income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":462.58,"image":{"id":1396323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase pigs and feed for them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kvebi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T00:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T00:30:07Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":152.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":154.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":160.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":163.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":182.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.45,"local_amount":141.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":142.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857626,"comment":null},{"amount":89.87,"local_amount":146.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":148.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134277,"comment":null},{"amount":93.24,"local_amount":152.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":154.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107858,"comment":null},{"amount":94.84,"local_amount":154.85,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":156.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255392,"comment":null},{"amount":98.18,"local_amount":160.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":162.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T23:17:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587574,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75.71,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a stock of biscuits, candies, breads, beverages, canned goods, noodles, eggs, fruits, and vegetables to offer daily in her simple store.

He uses a hand-push cart to haul his portable polystyrene containers and sell sodas, canned beer, and liquor. He has managed to earn enough to support his family, give his son a basic education, and pay monthly bills. \r\n\r\nIgnacio is hardworking, active, and always positive about life. He strives to get ahead along with his family and face bad weather, which has become his major challenge. Despite everything, he always looks for chances to succeed, so he has applied for his second loan cycle. He will use the loan to buy wholesale merchandise (sodas, beer, and alcohol) and to buy polystyrene containers to replace worn ones so that he can continue with this job, which has gotten him through tough times over the years. Ignacio dreams of opening his own liquor store, where he would be more comfortable and safer, and which would let him earn more so that he can ensure that his son has the chance for a better education and that his family has a better standard of living.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source of income for the family is an agricultural business. They have 7 cows and produce cheese which is sold locally. Besides that, the family cultivates a plot of land where nuts are grown. They own a vineyard as well. The harvested products are sold at the local open market, but the income is hardly enough for food and every day expenses for an eight-person family. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo, Kiva's field partner, to start up a family business and build a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to vulnurable poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they're regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Nino will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Nino will grow greens and various types of vegetables. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family's income and all members will improve their living

She learned the work at a technical high school, from which she graduated approximately 30 years ago, and she has also worked at different tailoring businesses. What has given her business the most trouble is the lack of money to keep it going. She hopes to be able to use the loan to buy supplies for her work, which are thread, fabric, and lace. She hopes that it goes very well for her, since despite not having money to buy the supplies, many people have ordered from her and she is only waiting to have the money to start.

She has been selling seafod for 10 years in neighbouring villages. She buys seafood in large quantities at the beach and then takes the bus to several villages to sell her wares door to door. She does this in the morning, which usually allows her to be done by midday, since she has many regular customers. She goes to the coastal area of the city very early in the morning to meet with her providers, whom she calls before travelling in order to know what they caught. She can thus determine how much seafood she will buy and where to sell it. The loan she is taking out will serve a double purpose. Nuvia will use it to reimburse another, higher-interest loan to another lending institution. In spite of her weekly repayments, Nuvia noticed that all she is doing is repaying the interest, and not the principal, owing to which the remaining amount of debt stays the same. With the rest of the sum, she will buy more seafood to sell. Thus, the loan will help her face her two main current challenges: alleviating her debt burden and acquiring more supplies for her business. Nuvia is very keen to keep the business going because she says that it can provide a hefty income with which to pay for household expenses. The house where Nuvia and her family live is made of sheet metal and she needs the income from her business in order to improve her basic living conditions by installing a new roof and a new floor. Her greatest dream is to see her daughters succeed in school, since she herself did not have the opportunity to study. Nuvia has been working since she was very young in order to help her family with household expenses. This is why she wants her daughters to have a different life and better prospects for their future thanks to education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":173.01,"image":{"id":1398782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to reimburse another, higher-interest loan, and to buy more seafood to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuvia Marleni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":45.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":72.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":42.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":42.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815003,"comment":null},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":44.51,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":44.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090836,"comment":null},{"amount":45.22,"local_amount":45.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":45.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856834,"comment":null},{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":41.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:51:49Z","rounded_local_amount":41.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505106,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-23T12:53:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587656,"name":"Musu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 33-year-old Musu.

The harvest feeds the family, with the surplus being sold to neighbours and friends. Marcos tills the land with the help of his son: together, they take care of the harvest and do their best to have as productive a farm as possible. The loan Marcos asks for will be used to to buy fertiliser, pesticides, and herbicides for the last harvest of the season. He and his son will thus be able to cultivate the land for one more year.

Her children are all grown up and self-sufficient. Shaken has a secondary education. She is composed, level-headed and hard working by nature. For the primary source of income for her family, Shaken has practiced animal husbandry for many years now, starting her business with 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, Shaken has on her farm: 5 milk cows, 3 calves, 15 sheep, and also has a 1.72 hectare plot of land on which she grows clover. Her business brings in about 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk, dairy products, eggs, and chickens, which serves to cover the cost of food and daily living needs for her family. Remittances from Russia, where Shaken's son and  daughter-in-law earn a living, serve as additional income. The profits from Shaken's agricultural business allowed her to marry off her children and help them start their households. For the purpose of the further development of her business, Shaken turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy bulls and sheep. Shaken plans to invest the earnings from this loan in the further expansion of her farm and she would also like to repair her house in the

She also sold them in the nearest town market, which is about 8 kms away from the village. She used to purchase used clothes from the city market and sell them. The profit was sufficient to manage daily expenses with a monthly savings. She started feeling chest pain after frequently traveling to make sales. She quit her used clothes selling business and decided to start a poultry business to generate income.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoikholhing is planning to purchase 50 to 60 chicks in different breeds, raise them and sell them when they are fully grown. She will vaccinate and raise them with nutritional chicken feeds. There are women market vendors who sell poultry in the town market and in the city market. She will supply the poultry sellers from home without traveling distances. That way her health will be improved and subsequently she will generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for this opportunity and says the essential, most requisite -- i.e. capital money -- will be provided by the esteemed Kiva via WSDS.

The inability to continue studies during childhood days and poor financial conditions of the family is still taking its toil. It left Neikhol with very few options to generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nNeikhol is the featured borrower member for \"Chullou Lom\" Group. She is pictured on the extreme left with hand raised. All group members reside in a village that is about 40 kms on the southern side of the state in Manipur. Manipur is one the northeastern states of India.\r\n \r\nNeikhol grows chives as her main produce in the fields. Chives grow fast and they are ready to be sold in three months. Chives are easy to sell as they can be prepared in various ways. She also sells other fresh vegetables in accordance with the season and the demands. She sells mustard, pumpkins, bean sprouts, bay leaves, lady's finger, pea-shoots, yams, etc. She gets the vegetables from the fields at dawn, goes to the town market, and spends her whole day selling vegetables. Since the market is on the main National Highway, she manages to sell all her hoardings for a day. Customers throng in from all the nearby villages, and travelers and passersby also drop in to purchase vegetables. \r\n\r\nThe town market is popularly known for reasonable rates and quality. Neikhol says she is lucky to have a place in the town market because this market is the main reason why she is able to supplement and manage the family expenses. \r\n\r\nThe unavailability of capital money paralyses most of her ideas and plans to make a better livelihood  But she says she wanted to generate income by selling pigs, and she used her savings to purchase those piglets and she raises them at the back of her house.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase seeds and saplings of Rabi crops to grow. (Rabi crops are sewn in winter and harvested in spring.) She will purchase saplings of cabbage, cauliflower, broad beans, peas and pea-shoots, garlic, onions, spring onions, chives, broccoli and more.\r\n\r\nShe says she will continue growing vegetables and selling them for profits. She will take rest only when her children can take care of the family affairs. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the absolute financial assistance for an underserved vendor like her, which paves the way for her to continue and promote better means to generate income. She asks Kiva to continue helping her in the future and also says, \u201cKiva work is very motivational and inspirational. Thank you, Kiva.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in growing chives and selling them in the town market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1390623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase more Rabi crops to grow and sell  for profits.

Three of her children are grown and independent, and Kenjekan's daughter, who attends 10th grade, lives with her.  Kenjekan has a higher education.  She has been working the night shift at the hospital for 32 years and is very well liked by her colleagues.  They says that she is a kind and hardworking woman.  To provide an additional source of income for her family, Kenjekan got involved in animal husbandry and farming in 2008, having started this business with 50,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent and diligent work, Kenjekan's business contains 3 horses, 4 cows, 15 sheep, and also a land plot of 1.20 hectares, where she plants clover, beans and strawberries.  Her business yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  The profits from the business allowed Kenjekan to marry off her children and provide for them.  In order to further develop her business, Kenjekan requested a loan in the amount of 125,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse.

This area is coming to be one of the more populated communities in Montserrado, due to some options like good roads, quiet, and lower house rental prices. \r\n       \r\nRuth is 32 years old and she completed 12th grade. She is married to a driver and they have a one-year-old child who is always with Ruth. Ruth is presently selling rubber dishes, such as cups, plates, spoons and bowls, and is also selling lappa (a traditional cloth mostly used in Africa by women). She started in business by selling frozen food seven years ago with a little money from her mother. She learned this way of selling from her friends.\r\n\r\nRuth received a loan of twenty thousand Liberian Dollars to buy more rubber dishes and lappa to increase her sales. She complains that the rainy season is the biggest challenge she faces since she does not have a shop. She admires her business because it makes her independent, and she is so proud of her business because from there she handles her own money. Her dream is to live a better life in the future, and hopes that one day her child will become president.

En este lugar han surgido varios j\u00f3venes emprendedores que han aprovechado las oportunidades que su ciudad brinda para salir adelante.\nTal es el caso de Roddy, un alba\u00f1il que desde hace 3 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con el negocio de crianza de pollos y cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 desde ni\u00f1o con el ejemplo y ense\u00f1anzas de su padre que tambi\u00e9n se dedica a lo mismo. Roddy invierte en esta actividad 3 veces a la semana para no descuidar los trabajos de construcci\u00f3n en los que le contratan eventualmente, sin embargo, los d\u00edas que no puede atender a los animales, paga a una persona para que se encargue de la alimentaci\u00f3n y la supervisi\u00f3n de los mismos. Roddy ha podido recapitalizar sus ganancias comprando m\u00e1s pollos y cerdos pero es necesario para su manutenci\u00f3n m\u00e1s alimento, para lo cual est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual pueda comprar afrecho para los cerdos y balanceado para los pollos en cantidades grandes y as\u00ed poder mantener bien alimentados y sanos a los animales de tal forma que Roddy pueda ofrecer a sus clientes un producto garantizado y con el adecuado control de calidad que demanda este negocio. Roddy sue\u00f1a con crecer con su negocio y ver un d\u00eda a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia. ","en":"Roddy, age 31, was married for nine years.  He is now going through the big hurdle of the separation from his life partner.  They had three children, ages 9, 7, and 11 months.  Roddy has an elementary school education.  With that knowledge he has worked as a bricklayer since he was very young.  He has worked on various constructions with the objective of his children not having to do without anything.\r\n\r\nRoddy lives in the R\u00edo Verde parish in the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province.  It is an inland port that moves Ecuadorian commerce upon joining the mountainous and coastal regions of this country.  Its climate is humid, and the temperature favors agricultural and livestock business activities.  Commerce has also grown, supporting the economic development in the area.\r\n\r\nIn this place several young entrepreneurs have emerged, and they have taken advantage of the opportunities that their city offers in order to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with Roddy, a bricklayer.  Three years ago he undertook the business of raising chickens and pigs to later sell.  He learned this business activity as a boy by his father\u2019s example and teachings.  He father also raises animals.  Roddy spends three times a week on this business activity so that he does not neglect any possible construction jobs that he is hired for.  Nevertheless, on the days that he cannot tend to the animals he pays a person to feed and take care of the animals.\r\n\r\nRoddy has been able to recapitalize his earnings by purchasing more chickens and pigs.  However, he needs more feed to maintain the animals.  That is why he is requesting a loan to be able to buy large quantities of grains for the pigs and balanced feed for the chickens.  This way he will be able to keep his animals well-fed and healthy.  This way Roddy will be able to offer his customers guaranteed product, and he will have adequate control of the quality, which this business demands.  \r\n\r\nRoddy dreams are to grow with his business and to one day see his children become excellent professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":891.27,"image":{"id":1398853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

As this income is not enough for the newlywed couple, Lasha decided to start up a business and become financially independent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Lasha was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions, as they required a stable income and business experience as a precondition to a loan. But Lasha has now received his loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

The knowledge which she gained in primary school did not open many doors for her in the labor market. Nevertheless, she dedicated herself to the household duties for a long time. She is married to Segundo, 46, a hardworking man who is a professional taxi driver in the city. He and Beatriz have one son, who is in a state school. They hope that one day he will become a professional who contributes to the country's improvement. \r\n\r\nBeatriz lives with her family in the parish of R\u00edo Verde in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a terrestrial port which mobilizes trade between the Sierra and Costa regions of Ecuador. Its climate is humid and favorable for agriculture and livestock. Trade has also grown, bringing economic development to the region. \r\n\r\nIn this area, various young entrepreneurs have taken advantage of the opportunities which their city offers for success, such as Beatriz. Some time ago, she decided to help with the household expenses to improve her family's quality of life. She sells cosmetics as a traveling saleswoman, traveling through the city's long streets to offer her products for sale. She makes deliveries and takes payments from her clients, who are mostly women. \r\n\r\nBeatriz has applied for a loan to buy some of the most popular products, using offers which her suppliers offer her. She will then be able to keep products in stock and satisfy the needs of her most demanding clients. She hopes to improve her earnings so that she can cover some of her household expenses and give her son a comfortable life and education.\r\n\r\nBeatriz has joined up with two of her friends, Ang\u00e9lica and Decci, who are also small business owners.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica, 33, is married and also sells cosmetics. She will invest in merchandise which will increase her income, so that she can give her two children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nDecci, 34, is married with three children. She will invest her part of the loan in the purchase of chickens and feed. She makes a living raising chickens to sell.\r\n\r\nThese three women joined up with one goal in common: to give up all pretexts about a lack of work and grow in their businesses to show everyone that it is possible to succeed by putting in effort and working hard."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1264.2,"image":{"id":1398965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products to keep her business stocked.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Gricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Decci Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2062.44,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":228.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":242.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":253.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":255.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":260.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":268.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":272.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":280.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":346.22,"local_amount":344.12,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":346.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814480,"comment":null},{"amount":260.99,"local_amount":259.41,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":260.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320651,"comment":null},{"amount":129.43,"local_amount":128.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":129.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856339,"comment":null},{"amount":259.79,"local_amount":258.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":259.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059917,"comment":null},{"amount":267.77,"local_amount":266.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":267.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-26T20:44:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588599,"name":"Maria Amparo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Amparo tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de familia de 1 hijo el cual vive en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n  junto a su esposo.

That is why Artak periodically goes to the Russian Federation for work abroad, because he needs to somehow enlarge his family income.\r\n\r\nIn his farm, Artak cares for six cows, four heifers, five calves and twenty-five chickens. He also, together with his parents, cultivates their plot of land. They raise vegetables, and fruit and nut trees (e.g., apple, pear, plum, and hazelnut). They perfectly manage to sell products of their farm, including dairy products, eggs and fruits. With the income earned by farming, Artak has already bought some furniture for the house.\r\n\r\nNow Artak wants to start a beekeeping business.

Her husband\u2019s a merchant.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use the loan for herself and for her husband since both of them run separate businesses.  She\u2019s in charge of a snack bar at a local school and he has a small dining room at home where he sells seafood cocktails, seafood stew, fish and roasted pork with fried banana chips which are very popular local dishes.  She sells tasty, nutritious snacks she makes herself as well as very delicious fruit juices that she makes to please the little ones.  She\u2019s been in this business for more than 7 years and her husband has been at it much longer.  This is how they get ahead in an honest, honorable way. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy fish, seafood, pork, fruit and other food items needed to prepare the dishes.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank for more than four years and likes it because the loans have improved their businesses.  Her dream is that her son becomes a professional.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1191.66,"image":{"id":1399025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fish, seafood, pork, fruit and other food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Gricelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1294.21,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":107.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":107.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":215.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815858,"comment":null},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":215.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":216.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966069,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":323.55,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857805,"comment":null},{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":215.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506174,"comment":null},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":215.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":216.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-20T16:45:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":587804,"name":"Clifford","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clifford is 28 years old and from Talibon, Bohol.

He has been involved in butchering activities since he was 15 years old, because his father has been a butcher all his life and taught Andr\u00e9s the trade. Two years ago, with the support of a sister, he started a scrap yard, with which he did very well, but for various reasons the owner of the premises terminated their contract and the business was closed.\r\nAndr\u00e9s is a determined, sensible, and energetic man; for this reason, about 5 months ago he sublet a butcher shop that was going to close; it is located in a minimarket in the neighborhood where he lives.

from Sierra Leone! This is 47-year-old Iye from Moriba town, Bo, Southern area, in Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of 8 years and 18 years. Her children are attending school. Her husband is a driver, so his income is not enough to take care of the home.\r\n\r\nIye runs a cookery business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 15 years. She wake up 4:30 a.m. to prepare her cookery business, and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her to run the cookery business. Her business is the only source of income she has. Iye describes her major hardship as sometimes it is very difficult to prepare the cooked food.  \r\n\r\nIye has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking items, including bags of rice, coconut oil and pure water. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change her cookery structure and pay her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to have her own residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":179.19,"image":{"id":1396776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Thanks to this experience, he now has bean, potato and corn crops. He sells his products in his town's market square to earn an income and sustain his family. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is a humble, hardworking man who is committed and dedicated to his family and his work. He has gone through difficult financial situations due to external factors he could not control, such as the unstable price of products and the harshness of the changing weather which has damaged his crops on several occasions. However, despite all this, he still constantly searches for opportunities to succeed. \r\n\r\nTherefore, he has applied for a loan to invest in the purchase of farm supplies (manure, fertilizer, pesticide, and fungicide) that will allow him to give continuity to his crops and finish the harvest with good-quality products. He will then be able to offer the crops at a good price, earning a higher income. Jos\u00e9 dreams of expanding his crops and taking advantage of his available land to plant a greater variety of products. He will then have the opportunity to give his children a better education and improve his household's financial stability, creating a prosperous future for the entire

Since 2008, she has made a living with her own business, a grocery store where she sells dairy products, meat, cookies, and cakes, among other products. This has allowed her to provide for her household. \r\n\r\nMary has gone through very difficult times, as she was a victim of a tragedy in her region in 2010 when a landslide brought on by strong rains took away everything she had worked so hard to build. However, with her positive attitude and her spirit to overcome, she has managed to move forward alongside her son and her parents. With plenty of effort, hope, and dedication, she started her business once again, and little by little she has been recuperating the level of sales which she had before the tragedy. Due to the landslide, the region's inhabitants were forced to move and sales fell abruptly during that time. \r\n\r\nMary has applied for a loan to invest in the purchase of wholesale stock (cakes, cookies, dairy products, and others) to take advantage of discounts which have been offered to her. She will then be able to have a better profit when she makes sales, which will allow her to continue providing for her household. She will make one more step towards fulfilling her greatest dream, which is to convert her business into a well-known mini supermarket which is often visited by customers. She will then have the ability to provide her family with better well-being and to give her son an excellent

She has a high-school education and works in the local post-office. Her spouse helps around the house. Zamira has bred cattle since 1998 when she began her business with 20,000 som. The farm consists of one milk cow, three calves, and 1.5 hectares of land for planting cabbage and tomatoes. She earns 10,000 som per month from her livestock and crops. She receives additional income from her eldest daughter who lives and works in Russia. Zamira would like to own more livestock, so she asked the microfinance institution Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som in order to buy cows and fertilizers.

Four of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nMonica runs a cookery business; she sells cooked rice, fried fish, and cool drinks. She has been running this business for 20 years. She wakes up 4:30 am to prepare her cookery business and she will not rest until the food is finished. One of her daughters usually helps her run the cookery business. Her business is the only source of income she has. Monica's major hardship is that sometimes preparing the cookery is very difficult.  \r\n\r\nMonica has requested a loan in order to purchase cooking item including bagged rice, coconut oil, soft drinks, and pure water.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to change her cookery structure and save money to buy a vehicle for her husband. In the future, she plans to have her own residence.

Lily\u2019s passion for fashion led her to establish an online store for women\u2019s clothing four years ago. She also sold at the farmers\u2019 market, and the response was so positive that Lily was inspired to pursue her dream, opening a boutique in San Rafael just last year. Lilyluv Boutique is stocked with trendy, edgy clothing and accessories for young women and is committed to modest pricing, the only store of its kind in Marin County. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge to opening Lilyluv Boutique was getting funded. Lily used all of her own savings to establish the business. When denied for a conventional bank loan, Lily felt that she was not taken seriously because she is a young woman. The discouragement did not hamper Lily; her determination to prove to herself that she could be successful, as well as a Kiva loan from Working Solutions, propelled her forward. She hopes her boutique inspires other young women to \u201cfollow their dreams, follow their passions\u201d despite the odds against them. \r\n\r\nThis loan will enable Lily to purchase the inventory she needs to grow the boutique and online store, purchase store furniture, and further promote her business. \r\n\r\nFor more information on Lilyluv, visit the website at www.shoplilyluv.com, the

His business is highly dependent on how much working capital float he has, in order to process customer transactions.  Currently he does not have enough to help all of his customers and he is constantly having to re-balance between his electronic balances and cash balances. This is made even harder by the fact that there is only one bank in Mwandi village and it takes about 24 hours for him to get his money once he sends it to the bank. This means that he cannot serve as many customers as he would like to. He loses out on profit.\r\n\r\nMark is excited to continue to offer mobile money services to his community. He says the support from Kiva has helped his to start and grow his business and improve his quality of life.

He is a modest, hardworking person who is engaged in the cultivation of corn, beans, and sorghum.  He learned this work at an early age from his father.  Since he is the eldest of his brothers, he recalls that his father bought him a \u201ccuma\u2019 [curved knife] to carry and taught him how to clear the cornfield. Rising early and working all day, he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to study until he was fourteen years old and they sent him to school where he learned to read and write.  Later, he decided to start his own family and has been cultivating basic grains and fattening Creole pigs to make a living and pay for other necessities. Nowadays, he is teaching his son how to cultivate so that he can develop job skills in the future and give him space to study and develop other skills.\r\n\r\nHe purchases his supplies at a place that gives him better prices and the quality products that he needs for growing such as seeds, fertilizer, and poisons to control pests and diseases in his crops.  In this way, he can plant a good cornfield and yield good production at the harvest.  In addition, he has to travel 15 kilometers in his \u201cpick-up\u201d to get to the place where his customers find the products they need.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase twelve bags of sulfate, and sorghum for planting.  He will also buy products such as fungicides, insecticides to control pests and diseases, and herbicides for weed control in crops. In addition, he will use a portion of the funds to pay people that help him with land preparation, sowing, and fertilizing planted crops.\r\n\r\nThis investment will help the client purchase agricultural inputs and so, cultivate basic grains for his family\u2019s consumption.  He will also be able to dedicate himself to his crops as he has done since childhood, and in this way, generate income for his family.  Last year, he had problems with his harvest because he didn\u2019t have money to take care of his crops.  However, thanks to the support that Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is offering him today, he will be able to sow his basic grains and give them the necessary attention to obtain a better production. In this way, he will have food for his family as well as income to pay for the needs of his wife and children.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that after paying off this loan, he will take out another one and allocate it to purchase cattle (heifers), fatten them up and have them impregnated, and later sell them. In this way, he will be able to generate more income to pay for his household needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1398929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase sulfate, sorghum, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, and pay laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-29T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-28T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Aguedo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-28T18:18:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588036,"name":"Arthur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arthur runs a service-based business providing motorcycle transportation in the community of Taguitic, Lanao del Norte.
