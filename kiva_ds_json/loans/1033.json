was one of the first of his generation of Malbri to grow up in a modern Mlabri world.  Before him, his father had known the hardships \u2013 and the independence \u2013 of a life lived mainly in the jungles.  Rampant deforestation and extensive agriculture reduced forested land to a fraction of its past area.  By the time Daeng was born in 1983, the Mlabri people had been reduced to indentured servitude in the slash & burn fields of other ethnic groups in Thailand.\n\nDaeng grew up in the Ban Bunyuen village, and learned to read and write at the school there.  Basic education opened up many new avenues of knowledge for him, while village elders and his older relatives introduced him to the ways of the jungle.  Daeng thus straddles both generations; he is an example to the younger ones, and a help in guiding the older ones through the intricacies of modern life.\n\nDaeng does not have the same fear of the outside world as the older generation does.  He can hold his own in a pinch and he knows where to go for help when he\u2019s hard pressed.\n\nLike many of his fellow weavers, Daeng weaves hammocks to provide a better life for his wife and their children- he\u2019s a great dad!  He is savvy enough to make wise decisions in his purchases, yet retains a uniquely Mlabri penchant for helping others \u2013 something that weaving hammocks allows him to do. \n\nDaeng was one of the first to tell about Mlabri life in his lead role in the documentary film, The Importance of Being Mlabri.

Using local organic cotton, One Mango Tree designs and produces womens\u2019 clothing and accessories and provides additional training to its tailors to create new designs with their input. Seventeen women now work for One Mango Tree, and their jobs support their children\u2019s ongoing education.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, she started to sell apparel directly to the public as well as wholesale to specialized retail shops. Her Kiva loan will be used to help Halle increase inventory, in terms of both variety (color, sizes and styles) and quantity.

Her loan requests were always rejected because of lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNazi owns a building and plans to set up a grocery store there.

She is separated from her partner, who is the father of her only child (a son of 17), and lives with her mother, her two brothers, her son and her sister-in-law in the house which was bequeathed to them by her father.  Our friend Lenny's main business activity is selling one of Peru's most traditional dishes: \"Cebiche\".  At different times of year, she also devotes some of her free time to selling women's, men's and children's clothing.  Her seafood restaurant is a family business which has been in existence for 11 years and she serves her customers there in a friendly way, helped by her mother, her sister-in-law, and her brothers.  Since she set up the business, she has achieved great success because her sales have always been positive.  From time to time she sells items of clothing.  She likes her work very much because it keeps her busy and enables her to generate the income she needs to cover her personal expenses and those of her son whom she loves very much.  So great has been the success she has achieved in her restaurant that she now wants to equip it with better furniture and other fittings to provide comfort for her customers.  This is her thirteenth loan from MFP and so she is grateful to all those who make it possible for her to continue to pursue her goals. Furthermore, she is once again very committed to make her repayments on time, as was the case for her other loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank because all its members are very kind, friendly and caring.  She plans to spend the loan amount requested (S\/. 1800) on 4 tables with matching chairs, as well as various ingredients which she needs to continue her seafood restaurant business.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1269180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy 4 tables and matching chairs, as well as various ingredients which she needs to continue with her seafood restaurant business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-08T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-07T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":287.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":297.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":299.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":320.04},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":264.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":272.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573173,"comment":null},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":287.05,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:15Z","rounded_local_amount":295.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122815,"comment":null},{"amount":119.92,"local_amount":297.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":306.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868638,"comment":null},{"amount":120.77,"local_amount":299.83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":308.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577472,"comment":null},{"amount":128.9,"local_amount":320.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":329.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529709,"comment":null},{"amount":133.07,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":339.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974740,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-10T01:17:59Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":514735,"name":"Fidela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fidela, de 58 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora.

27-year-old Mamie from Kulanda town Bo in Sierra Leone. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 2 and 10. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2006, Mamie established her food stand. She began her business because she needs to generate income to support her family. She works at the business 15 hours a day, seven day a week. She describes her main challenges to her business as her customer's low purchasing power, which means she has to keep her prices too low. \r\n\r\nMamie requires a loan to buy more mayonnaise, eggs and cooking seasoning. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her standard of living. In the future, Mamie plans to become an international businesswoman.

They are all local entrepreneurs who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva, to apply for a loan of 500,000 SLL apiece. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their respective businesses, make more sales and consequently improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAmadu is the leader of this group. The 24-year-old is single with no children. For a number of years now, Amadu has been selling bowls. Though capital is low, Amadu has been able to make a living out of his bowl business. With the help of this loan, however, his capital will increase a bit, enabling him to buy a larger quantity of bowls to add to his current stock.

She has four children, two of which are now adults and two of which are still minors: Divana, 15, and Diego, 16. These two live with her in the house that she received as a gift when she got married, hence giving them the best she can offer so that they can grow up to be good people. \r\n\r\nThe work to which our friend Leni dedicates herself is the sale of food. At night she sets up her tables and her kitchen on the sidewalk to sell all of the dishes that she has prepared during the day. Many people come to her stand in search of a satisfying meal, consuming exquisitely seasoned stews. At the same time, she takes advantage of the opportunity to sell refreshing drinks and sometimes soft drinks of every flavor. She has been working at this job for 4 years now, and she has learned that she must always be in high spirits and put on a pleasant smile for her customers so that they feel good about coming to her and want to come back in the future. Some weekends she offers barbecue from morning until night.\r\n\r\nShe is very good in what she does, now that she has many customers with whom she is able to generate good daily earnings. She hopes to continue her work and in the future open her own restaurant to continue offering to her customers the best and most varied in what she refers to as culinary art. Therefore, she is thankful to those who would make this loan possible in order to continue her objectives. She is also very determined to once more make her payments on schedule as she has done with loans that she has received in the past. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank with such good, friendly and supportive members. With the amount for which she has asked (S\/. 1800; $725), she will be able to buy all of the staples that are necessary for the preparation of her meals.

She describes her problems as slow purchasing power of customers and a poor road network within her operation area.\r\n\r\nMariama has requested a loan in order to buy more local food like palm oil, rice and gari. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay school fees for her children and improve her level of living. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mariama plans to become a supplier of local foodstuff. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1272272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more local food like palm oil, rice and gari.

Vodyanoye. He and his wife have been farming vegetables (mainly cucumbers, tomatoes and radishes) on their own land for five years.

She\u2019s single and has a 3-year-old little boy she cares for with much love and protection; she wants to provide him with a good quality of life.  She lives in her own house alongside her two sisters who she welcomes in her home affectionately.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s work consists in sewing clothes.  She has a home-based workshop and has been doing this work for 16 years.  Everything she knows she learned working from a very young age as an employee of a woman who did this kind of work.  Gradually and with much patience she learned sewing techniques and then decided to become independent to generate her own income by putting into practice everything her former employer had taught her.\r\n\r\nDuring the time she\u2019s been in this activity, she\u2019s always sought the best way to do her work because often pressure from her customers has made her feel like she\u2019d be unable to do her work efficiently.  However, she faced these adversities and currently plans to expand the business but knows that the road to attain this is long and for the moment wants to keep it as a long-term goal.  For now, she\u2019s getting ready to start manufacturing her own designs to sell; she already has pending customer orders.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 and she\u2019s grateful to those who make the loan possible so she can continue towards her objectives.  On the other hand, she\u2019s committed once again to punctually make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans she got.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are very good, kind and mutually supportive.  She will use the requested 1,200 soles to increase her workshop buying fabric, needles, thread and other accessories she needs to continue with her clothes making work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1271797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

Her clients are surgeons who hire her services for distribution of medical supplies mainly for the hospitals of Miami. Dianelys carries all the disposable materials needed for surgery rooms.

Dianelys is interested in expanding into the Broward region of Florida.  To do this, she needs marketing help.  \n\nAssist Dianelys in her dream of expanding her business.  \u201cThe most important aspect of being business owners is providing the best possible service.

He has two children who are 4 and 6 years old. He makes a living selling a variety of bedspreads, sheets and blankets from his store which is located in the Delicias neighborhood in the city of Cochabamba. This is the first loan he will be taking out through the communal bank. Ramiro will use the loan to buy a variety of bedspreads at wholesale price, as it is currently the season in which there is high demand and he wants to stock his business. The reason he has requested a loan is because he has received various orders and he does not have the necessary funds to be able to buy the requested items.

Marcela says that over 30 years ago her family bought a cargo truck [three wheeled motorized vehicle with a large cargo bay] .  They rent it during the harvest season (when the sugar refineries start to produce sugar).  They rent it for hauling the sugarcane.\n\nMarcela only has an elementary school education, and she is married to Miguel.  She says that because she did not have much education, she started working when she was very little.  Ever since she formed her family with Miguel, they have worked side by side in order to get their family ahead and to, each day, have the opportunity for a better life.\n\nShe also told us that in the future she would like to start a new business and continue performing maintenance on the truck.  A loan from VisionFund will give Marcela the opportunity to buy some things to provide maintenance on her cargo truck in order to continue renting it.\n\nThis group is grateful to VisionFund for the

","en":"Kiyom is an educated and open-minded man.  Thanks to his parents, he was able to attend college, and all his life he has worked hard and honestly for the good of his own people.  He is now 50 years old.  He is married and has five children.  Since his wife is a homemaker, he is the main breadwinner in the family, although his older children are also working.\r\n\r\nFor the past five years he has been teaching at a high school and he is one of the best teachers there.  All his income is used to meet the needs of his family and therefore he is unable to save any money.  His daughter will soon get married, and he needs to give her a dowry.  Specifically, he would like to give her some furniture for her future house.  Kiyom and his daughter went to visit a furniture store, and his daughter showed him which furniture she would like to receive as a gift from him.  Kiyom cannot say no to her, although he doesn't have enough money to buy her expensive furniture.\r\n\r\nKiyom is requesting a loan of 2,500 somoni to buy some furniture.  He is relying on your kindness, since he is supposed to give furniture to his daughter before her wedding.  He promises to repay his loan on time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":478.61,"image":{"id":1272228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding

person from the Ecuadorian plains. Vicente is 48. He has 5 children and lives with his wife and children. Vicente is defined as a charismatic, honest, responsible and very cheerful person during the time he passes with his family. Vicente loves his family very much and he really likes the countryside. That is why, since he was little, he has worked in farming and raising animals.\r\n\r\nThe loan he has asked FODEMI for will be invested in buying two cows for double milking, because he distributes milk. Vicente says that working in the fields is arduous but has a lot of benefits, because he spends his time with his family and when you really work hard the earnings are very good.\r\n\r\nVicente's dream is to have a small farm with a lot of heads of cattle to be a milk distributor and sell in the markets and in the communities surrounding the area where Vicente lives."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1357.96,"image":{"id":1272421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows for double milking for milk production.

","en":"Burmakan is 46 years old, married, and has a son who is currently a university student. Burmakan has secondary education. She is a very calm and enterprising woman. As the main source of income for her family, Burmakan has been raising livestock since 2002, as well as growing crops since 1992, having started her business with a sum of 20,000 som. Thanks to her hard work, Burmakan's herd currently includes 2 cows and 21 goats and sheep, and she also works 3.6 hectares of land where she annually grows beans and perennial grasses.

escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a sus padres desde muy joven y ahora convive con su pareja \u00c1ngel de 64 a\u00f1os que se dedica al comercio ambulante y con quien tiene 3 hijos quienes se educan en una escuela p\u00fablica y Elba espera poder apoyarles en su educaci\u00f3n hasta que se conviertan en profesionales de excelencia. Elba y su familia viven en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nElba y su esposo han vivido situaciones dif\u00edciles econ\u00f3micamente pero no se han dado por vencidos y siempre han llevado el alimento a la mesa y a sus hijos nunca les ha faltado nada para su educaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, hace 4 a\u00f1os Elba decidi\u00f3 aportar a su hogar preparando unos helados con una receta secreta de su familia, los cuales son muy conocidos en la zona. Ella los prepara en las noches, cuando sus chicos ya descansan y los vende en el d\u00eda con la ayuda de sus hijos que le acompa\u00f1an al volver de la escuela.  Al dar a conocer el exquisito y refrescante sabor de sus helados, Elba ha ganado clientes y muy buena reputaci\u00f3n, por lo que los helados se terminan inmediatamente ya que apenas prepara la cantidad que puede almacenar en su refrigeradora. Ahora Elba requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para poder adquirir un congelador exclusivo para helados, de esta forma producir\u00eda m\u00e1s y sus ganancias ser\u00e1n mayores. Anteriormente ya ha realizado cr\u00e9ditos con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y ha regresado a solicitar su ayuda porque le ofrecen facilidades de pago y la atenci\u00f3n es excelente, mucho m\u00e1s ahora que puede aplicar al producto de kiva para que muchas personas en el mundo tambi\u00e9n formen parte de su sue\u00f1o de crecimiento. ","en":"Elba is a 34-year old woman who grew up in a family with limited resources. Nevertheless, she had the support to finish primary education, worked helping her parents since she was very young and now lives with her partner, Angel (64 years old), who works as a traveling salesman. Together they have 3 children, who attend a public school, and Elba expects to be able to provide them with an education to become excellent professionals. Elba and her family live in La Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, in Santo Domingo, capital of the Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, Ecuador, which has experienced a great sustainable growth in the last few years. The biggest attraction in the capital is its delicious fruit and cuisine. It also counts with a significant commercial sector, as it has become a ground port of commercial exchange between the Sierra and Costa regions. Moreover, it has several tourist attractions which, together with the warm weather, attract many local and foreign tourists. For this reason, the majority of its population has initiated a commercial or services activity for other residents or tourists. \r\n\r\nElba and her husband have gone through financially difficult situations, but they have never given up and have always been able to bring food to their home and to provide their children with everything they needed for their education. However, 4 years ago, Elba decided to contribute to the household expenses by preparing ice cream with a secret recipe of her family, and it has become very popular in the area. She makes it at nights, when her children are sleeping, and sells it during the day with her kids' help, who give her a hand when they come back from school. Thanks to the delicious and refreshing flavor of her ice cream, Elba has earned clients and a very good reputation. She makes the quantity she can fit in her freezer and the ice cream is sold immediately. \r\n \r\nElba is now requesting a loan to buy a freezer exclusively for ice cream, so that she will be able to make a larger quantity and increase her earnings. She has had loans with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa before and has decided to ask for financial support again given that the repayment conditions and the service she receives are excellent. She is excited to use this Kiva loan and to share her business growth dream with many people around the world.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1555.47,"image":{"id":1272456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

is a 30-year-old, single woman who opened a cafeteria 4 years ago to make her living. She sells coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, in addition to special fresh juices, biscuits, nuts, chocolates and chips.\r\n\r\nHeba is working hard to improve her business, that's why she introduced her customers to new brands to be sold such as bags and women's needs. She is requesting a youth loan from Al Majmoua to improve her business capital by buying new scarf collections and bags for the winter season. Heba is an expert in this field, since she used to work in a caf\u00e9 before she started her own business, and is improving her women's needs section with bags and scarfs.

Her main goal in life is to have a better profit so she can sustain the family's daily commodities and improve their way of living.\r\n\r\nRosie would like to maintain her hog raising business, but due to insufficient capital she has, she is asking for additional capital of 12,000 Philippines pesos (PHP). She will use this loan amount to buy livestock feed and vitamins to ensure proper growth of her hogs. She knows that with this loan amount, she could grow her hog business. Rosie hopes that her requested loan amount will be granted to help her gain her goal in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1272850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock feed and vitamins for her raised hogs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Antonio San Mateo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T17:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T17:30:22Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339444663,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346996509,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-22T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357122325,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-24T08:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4085.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365679779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-10T01:31:28Z","paid_date":"2013-05-24T08:41:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":515446,"name":"Bat-Erdene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bat-Erdene is 53 years old and lives with his wife and granddaughter in a small house in the Orhon province of Mongolia.

las imposibilidades de salud que por su edad a veces se presentan. Curs\u00f3 estudios de nivel primario, y el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que ha atravesado fue la muerte de su esposo hace algunos a\u00f1os. Tiene 6 hijos adultos que viven de manera independiente, excepto Lilian de 21 a\u00f1os con quien vive en la actualidad en Atuntaqui una ciudad de la provincia de Imbabura en  el norte del Ecuador.  Un lugar que goza de muchos lugares hist\u00f3ricos que ofrecer a quienes le visitan adem\u00e1s de una deliciosa gastronom\u00eda que es la favorita de  muchos en el pa\u00eds. Otra actividad que es muy conocida en este cant\u00f3n es la textil, pues el dise\u00f1o de ropa industrial y artesanal se ha convertido en una actividad que aporta al crecimiento sostenido de la ciudad por lo que las prendas elaboradas son preferidas por su diferente calidad y dise\u00f1os a nivel nacional e internacional. Cuenta con un clima agradable que es seco y templado lo que ayuda mantener sus tierras f\u00e9rtiles y por lo tanto aptas para el cultivo de cereales y legumbres. Por todas estas oportunidades existentes en la ciudad, Atuntaqui es considerado un centro productivo importante para el Ecuador, m\u00e9rito que no fuese posible sin la fuerza y esp\u00edritu emprendedor de sus habitantes que a la vez generan plazas de trabajo para las familias de la Provincia.\nExpuesta a inesperadas lluvias y a temperaturas fuertes de sol, Blanca ha mantenido su negocio de venta de ropa casual en un puesto designado en la calle donde varios comerciantes de ropa exhiben su mercader\u00eda. Blanca lleva en esta actividad 6 a\u00f1os y en el cual invierte 10 horas cada d\u00eda desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana hasta que el sol se oculta. Paralelamente a esta actividad, Blanca siempre est\u00e1 pendiente de su casa y los quehaceres que hay en ella y traslada sola la mercader\u00eda hasta su lugar de trabajo que aunque son bultos de gran tama\u00f1o su deseo de trabajar y sentirse \u00fatil la ha llevado a adquirir experiencia en todos estos detalles. A trav\u00e9s del tiempo Blanca sabe que cada temporada del a\u00f1o la demanda por cierto tipo de ropa cambia pero que los gustos por la ropa de siempre se mantienen, es por esto que requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar ropa de temporada e incrementar la variedad de ropa que ya tiene, para que sus clientes puedan encontrar lo que buscan y as\u00ed Blanca pueda generar m\u00e1s ingresos que le permitan cubrir sus necesidades y adem\u00e1s mejorar la calidad de vida. Blanca agradece la confianza y agilidad que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa le ha brindado para la obtenci\u00f3n del cr\u00e9dito y agradece a las personas que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva formar\u00e1n parte de su crecimiento. ","en":"Blanca, 60, is a hardworking woman who despite her age continues to work seeking daily support ignoring the health issues her age sometimes presents.  She attended elementary school and the hardest challenge she\u2019s had to face was the death of her husband some years ago.  She has six adult children who live on their own, except Lilian, 21, who currently lives with her in Atuntaqui, a city in Imbabura Province in northern Ecuador.  This is a place that has many historic sites of interest to those who visit in addition to a delicious cuisine that is the favorite of many in the country.  Another well-known activity in this canton is textiles for industrial and artisanal clothes making has become an activity that contributes to the city\u2019s support since the clothes manufactured here are preferred for their quality and design both nationally and internationally.  It has a pleasant climate that\u2019s dry and mild which helps keep the soil fertile and apt for growing cereals and legumes.  Because of all these opportunities available in the city, Atuntaqui is considered to be an important productive center in Ecuador, a distinction that would not have been possible without the strength and enterprising spirit of its residents who at the same time generate employment for families in the Province.\r\n\r\nExposed to sudden rainfalls and high temperatures under the sun, Blanca has kept her casual clothing business open in an assigned stand on the street where several clothes merchants display their merchandise.  Blanca has been in this activity for six years and she puts in ten-hour work days starting very early in the morning and going until sunset.  Blanca is also always watchful of her home and the chores that must be done there; she also transports the merchandise by herself to her work space even though the bundles are very large.  She wants to work and feel useful and this has led her to gain experience in all these details.\r\n\r\nAs time has passed, Blanca has learned that each season of the year demands a certain type of clothes b but that as styles change, good taste does not which is why she needs a loan to buy seasonal clothes to increase the variety of clothes she has so that her customers will find what they are looking for and Blanca will generate higher income to cover her needs and improve her quality of life.  Blanca is grateful for the trust and quickness with which Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided her loan and thanks people who through Kiva are part of her growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1273017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

seamstress who creates masterpieces of Tajik national dress. She is young and energetic. She is married and has one child. In order to provide the family with needed income, three years ago she started her business sewing women's clothes. She sews clothes at home. Thanks to her excellent service she has a wide range of clients. Her clients are women with taste, and it is very difficult to satisfy them, but Hosiyat easily copes with their whims. She handles all of the family expenses herself, since her husband is unemployed. She told her husband that he must find work, since it is hard for her to support the family by herself.  Her husband asked her to buy a ticket to Leningrad where he has friends who can help him find a job. Hosiyat has no money, so she is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni to buy a ticket for her husband. She is counting on you and your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1272802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to buy a plane ticket so that her husband can work abroad.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hosiyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":187.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":195.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":197.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":210.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":212.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":225.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":229.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":235.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":243.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":226.69,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":226.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339741016,"comment":null},{"amount":477.4,"local_amount":2273.31,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2273.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T13:43:49Z","paid_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":515458,"name":"Jaber","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jaber is from Iraq.

She has six children she wants to provide schooling for and raise until they can be independent.  She lives in her own house with her husband, Emilio, 56, who is a teacher and provides her with the strength to continue working hard; they support each other to have a better quality of life.  Nena\u2019s work consists in selling used clothes of all types and for all occasions for women, men and children.  She buys all her merchandise by the bundle in a shopping center in her city and then takes it to be sold in settlements along the river banks and in distant zones.\r\n\r\nShe started in this activity thanks to her husband\u2019s idea and initiative since he\u2019s a teacher in a settlement along the river bank where she takes her merchandise.  Seeing that it\u2019s easy and profitable she decided to continue with this activity and to date gets help from her husband.   She considers the business to be profitable because she has several customers and this generates good income.\r\n\r\nAlthough her work is sometimes somewhat heavy due to the trips she must make and because she has to carry the merchandise by herself, she knows that by exerting the maximum effort she will earn the higher profits.  Despite selling much, she\u2019d like to earn higher profits and sell in larger amounts which is why she wants to continue working and making her business grow.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, this will be MFP loan #13 and she can count on it to continue towards her objectives.  On her part, she commits once again to make her payments on time like she\u2019s done previously.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are very kind, mutually supportive people.   She will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy larger amounts of used clothes by the bundle seeking the lowest prices for volume purchases so that her profit margin will increase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1273082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy larger amounts of used clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-09T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-08T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":298.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":317.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":329.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":341.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":347.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":364.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":119.36,"local_amount":298.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":304.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122857,"comment":null},{"amount":127.07,"local_amount":317.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":323.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868679,"comment":null},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":329.52,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":335.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577515,"comment":null},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":341.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":348.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529750,"comment":null},{"amount":139.12,"local_amount":347.78,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":354.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974781,"comment":null},{"amount":145.92,"local_amount":364.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":371.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T11:45:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":515566,"name":"Marieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Xenia, de 21 a\u00f1os de edad., es una mujer trabajadora y din\u00e1mica, adem\u00e1s de amable y jovial.

This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Ilia owns a building and plans to set up a grocery store there. With the loan, he will purchase stock for the store. Selling grocery products will positively impact him. This new business initiative will double Ilia\u2019s income and enable him to improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1272985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Neli and her husband decided to start a`new business as their existing income wasn't enough for the family. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With the loan, Neli will purchase a car and her husband will serve the local people as a taxi driver.

","en":"Hakim is 45 years old.  He is married and is raising 2 minors.  Hakim is a very hardworking and kind person.  He works as part of a construction crew, specifically as a plasterer.  He works hard every day during the season.  His work season starts in March and lasts until November.  Every day he earns from 100 somoni to 150 somoni and uses his earnings for the needs of the family.  His work is hard and this is why he lost his health.
