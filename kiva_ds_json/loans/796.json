This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family, since she is in a common-law marriage and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health center.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Francisca was not present in the photograph for cultural reasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":1008316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy rugs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remigia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Sonia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15151.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1893.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1894.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133081,"comment":null},{"amount":278.11,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749893,"comment":null},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243377,"comment":null},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516245,"comment":null},{"amount":278.11,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441181,"comment":null},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495129,"comment":null},{"amount":278.1,"local_amount":1893.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1907.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260706,"comment":null},{"amount":278.28,"local_amount":1894.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1909.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T05:55:29Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393653,"name":"Pascuala","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pascuala es madre de familia de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposo y su hijo en una zona rural donde se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda exclusivamente, la casa en la que viven es propia y esta ubicada en el caser\u00edo de nombre \u201cSinchi Roca\u201d el cual pertenece al distrito de Tambogrande y el mismo a la provincia de Piura.

Now they have an established clientele and their home-made products are well liked  by all. Angel\u2019s biggest dream is to increase his business by offering a nice dining room. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy meat, eggs, turnover dough, cooking oil, soft drinks and other supplies that will be used in his restaurant.  He is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n and Kiva for the opportunity he is receiving.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1008335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in the city of Pisco, a city that is characterized by beautiful beaches, a warm climate, and one of the most beautiful tourist attractions of our country, the Ballestas Islands and the Candelabro. Santos loves Peruvian food, and one of the dishes that she likes most is the very delicious \"aji de gallina\" (chili pepper chicken, a Peruvian chicken stew). She is a mother and has two children whose ages are 4 and 14 and whom she loves very much and who are her reason for living. For economic reasons, she could only go to school up to the fifth grade of secondary education, but she would have liked to study gastronomy, because she very much likes to cook.\r\n\r\nThanks to her good cooking skill in preparing dishes, she began her business selling one of the Peruvian flagship dishes, the very delicious ceviche, 11 months ago. Santosa gets up very early to go in search of the ingredients to prepare this dish. She works about eight hours a day and can serve about 30 customers a day. She believes that she is doing well in her business because she is a good cook and furthermore, she treats her customers in a kindly manner.\r\n\r\nSantosa is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to their help she will be able to buy a freezer and a display case for the sale of her dishes, which will permit her to store the ingredients that she uses in preparation in an optimal manner and to have more order in showing her products. With it she will continue working and striving to accomplish her greatest dream, \"to have her own business location.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1008339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to

She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

is Jonalyn, 21, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is single and she manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nJonalyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of Php 16,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes to grow the business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1012599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"  to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T10:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T10:40:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275630,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5333.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5350.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998001,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3200.01,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606541,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5332.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5350.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095399,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T13:01:43Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395850,"name":"Amani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amani lives in Yei.

This work allows her to earn more for her family - she lives with her partner and 2 children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked, she tells us that she likes Pro Mujer and she likes the healthcare support she also receives from them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":1008419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T10:50:02Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madelinne\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian Carla\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yhoanina Maricela\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550.01,"local_amount":3750.06,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3773.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133084,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.03,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749896,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":1875.03,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243380,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516248,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":1875.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441184,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1875.03,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495130,"comment":null},{"amount":274.97,"local_amount":1874.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1886.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260707,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T03:52:39Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T11:00:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395852,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marilyn, she is 41 and a resident of Manila, Philippines.

Among them are: selling underwear, selling salchipapas, selling washed sand, selling skirts and selling weaving.  \r\n\r\nRufina indicates that she has been working with Pro Mujer for a year and joined the institution when she was invited by one of her friends. At present, she has a knitting business selling sweaters and blankets. She has been doing this for awhile, having learned at a business where she used to work.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase her capital. She will buy wool that she will acquire at fairs and later sell in her commercial space. This work allows her to generate resources to support her family.

is 50-year-old Sulaiman.  He is married and has 1 child, age 3 yrs. He has 1 additional dependent who lives with him.  In 1999, Sulaiman established his textiles business. He began his business because at the age of 19 years he went to one of the diamond mining towns known as Kono. However, due to the rebel war in Sierra Leone, they were attacked by rebels, and he fled to Makeni where he started doing petty business with the small amount of money he had by then. \r\n\r\nAfter some years when the business developed, he decided to come to Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, to continue his business until now. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

is Nena, 34, resident of Quezon City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nNena operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a common family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend money on cooking gas and food for one or two persons, when buying cooked rice and other foods cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 38,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and also frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNena dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

He is married and has one child.\r\n\r\nHaving started working at a young age, he already has eight years of work experience. His well-established garage offers such services as oil and tire changes. His garage has a good reputation and his services are very much in demand by car owners in the city.\r\n\r\nRozhgar took a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq to be able to renovate his garage and improve his working conditions.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor, which makes them unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Reginah hopes that in the future she will be able to learn hair dressing. \r\n\r\nReginah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Faridah is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past 4 years, Faridah has been working hard to manage her rearing animals, from which she sells milk. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to build more rental houses, and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and buy food to feed her family. Faridah hopes that in the future she will be able to become a secretary. \r\n\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Faridah's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1012728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to build

She started it with a small amount of savings and with her initiative to generate income and be useful.\r\n\r\nClaritza plans to invest this new loan by purchasing underwear for men and women; she is planning to start selling them in wholesale quantities. She plans to use her earnings to reinvest in her business and save. Her dream is to have a well-established business. She thanks all of you for your support!!!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1015067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy underwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-02-24T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-25T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silverio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belkis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solanyi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":98000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":8199.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7737.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7842.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7949.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8058.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8168.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8279.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8393.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8507.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8624.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":8742.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7495.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":410.62,"local_amount":15936.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15952.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263296701,"comment":null},{"amount":406.9,"local_amount":15792.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":15808.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016053,"comment":null},{"amount":418.09,"local_amount":16226.57,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16242.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276625022,"comment":null},{"amount":429.58,"local_amount":16673.01,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":16689.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476391,"comment":null},{"amount":441.42,"local_amount":17132.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":17149.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287456903,"comment":null},{"amount":418.39,"local_amount":16238.39,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":16254.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294550948,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T20:10:35Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396026,"name":"Shalom 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucia is the coordinator of the group \"Shalom 2\" named like this in honor to the biblical word.

At the onset of his credit history, he obtained a loan in the amount of 300 somoni, which he used to buy one bag of rice and gradually increased his product turnover to 7000 somoni.  He buys rice from dekhan farmers, who deliver several bags of rice to him at a wholesale price.  He sells the rice during the course of two weeks and then buys new product again.

In search of an financing source for her family, Gulmira started her own business in animal husbandry and farming ten years ago with an initial sum of 40,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, today her livestock business yields about 20,000 som per month from sales of milk and milk products.  The earnings from the business allow Gulmira to pay for her son's education at the Medical Institute.  In order to further expand her business, Gulmira requested a loan in the sum of 75,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow and ewes. She plans to invest the earnings into a further expansion of her

She is married and has 4 children, ages 26-33.  Her business is making fried foods and selling soft drinks, a business which she began with little working capital but helped by the most important beer company in Colombia.  Her client base grew gradually and with it her working capital.   She joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in the program of communal groups to gain enough capital to buy on credit and in greater volume.  Up to now she has received 6 loans and they have helped her acquire some property and especially for the possibility of buying on credit from her suppliers.  She has also succeeded in converting her business to her main source of income for her home.  Currently she is applying for Kiva financing, her seventh through the Foundation, and she will use it to buy cartons of soft drinks and ingredients to make the delicious foods that her customers like.  Her goal is to continue developing as an entrepreneur and also to be independent.  The success of her investment is in getting discounts and a good variety of products in the first third of the year.

In addition, to cover daily family expenditures, Baktygul purchases scrap metal that she then turns in to a factory.  In order to further grow her business, Baktygul has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase potato seeds.  Baktygul plans to invest her earning in order to further grow her holdings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1014776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-25T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-26T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baktygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":10156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370831,"comment":null},{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095439,"comment":null},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070991,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15234.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754549,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":15234.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631375,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T04:23:25Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396606,"name":"Moh","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Moh est une femme mari\u00e9e de 33 ans et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants qui r\u00e9side avec  son \u00e9poux \u00e0 Bougouni, dans le quartier H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord. \nN\u2019ayant pas fr\u00e9quent\u00e9e le syst\u00e8me scolaire, elle s\u2019int\u00e9ressa tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t aux activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus telles l\u2019achat vente de cr\u00e8mes, d\u2019ignames, de patates et de chaussures.

She sells cheese, dairy products, and gelatins. She is married and has a 1 year-old child who she hopes will become a successful person. Her husband is a public taxi driver and between the two of them they earn the income for their household. She began learning commercial business when she was 16 years old and was working in stores to help out her widowed mother. So, three years ago when she thought of a way to earn money on her own, she had no doubts about opening her own business, also because at the same time she needed to take care of tasks in her own home. She obtains her dairy products from the department of Magdalena and they are very natural and fresh, which has allowed her to gain a good number of customers. She is currently requesting a Kiva loan, her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy cheese at wholesale price. She will take advantage of the great demand for this product which takes place during carnaval season. Her customers love to make hors d'oeuvres from the cheese and things made from it. This guarantees a successful investment because she responds to her customer\u2019s requests.

She works as a seamstress making clothing for different lines of women's, men's and children's clothing.  Her business is the product of an inheritance given to her by her mother, who had it for about ten years.  She knew the business from experience, but perfected it in technical courses.\r\n\r\nShe has done well with her business and has a set customer base for whom she makes uniforms and also makes personal items to measure.  Her goal in the future is to have all of the technical infrastructure necessary to make new designs and varieties of products.  Currently, she has many orders for uniforms and a contract to fulfill from a high school and she does not have enough working capital to invest.  Her suppliers are stores where she makes purchases in cash.  Her assets are her machines and accounts receivable and she has the financial support of her spouse.  Her accounts receivable rotate their inventories quickly, so her portfolio is well managed.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for this loan, her first with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, so that she can purchase supplies to fulfill her contract and a sewing machine to improve her production times and the quality of her work.  Her investment is exciting because she has orders and the mark of 10 years of experience that her mother strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1009257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase supplies to complete her contract and a sewing machine to improve production time.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-25T01:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-26T01:50:20Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60728},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74590},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76330},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78111},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79934},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81799},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83707},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85661},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":87659},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89705},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91798},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109978}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.92,"local_amount":60728,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62224.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651425,"comment":null},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":74590,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76428.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141039,"comment":null},{"amount":88.8,"local_amount":154441,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":158247.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100926,"comment":null},{"amount":93,"local_amount":161733,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":165719.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774927,"comment":null},{"amount":48.13,"local_amount":83707,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":85770.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386921,"comment":null},{"amount":49.25,"local_amount":85661,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87772.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993789,"comment":null},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":87659,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":89819.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130163,"comment":null},{"amount":51.58,"local_amount":89705,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91916.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519066,"comment":null},{"amount":116.02,"local_amount":201776,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":206749.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817573,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-25T03:43:16Z","paid_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396359,"name":"Neganda1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shumirai is a 48-year-old married woman from Masvingo with 4 children, aged 22, 19, 11 and 4 years.

He grows tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Alexander has five large greenhouses and two separate ones for seedlings. All the greenhouses are heated. Alexander has been growing vegetables for ten years and has approximately 200,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) invested in the business. He spends about 84,000 UAH annually on seeds and polyethylene sheeting to insulate the greenhouses. Alexander needs another 20,000 UAH to purchase coal to keep the greenhouses heated. He has set up a heating system in each greenhouse, but it requires a lot of coal, which is getting more and more expensive each year in Ukraine. Alexander believes there is a good future for his business in this region of the country. Near his home there are two plots of land for sale. Alexander hopes to purchase the land for his business and to continue expanding.
