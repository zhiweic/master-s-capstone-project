age 50, would like to start up a small dairy farm business. He lives in Chiatura District with his wife, their three grown sons, and a daughter-in-law. Mamia has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to obtain family business start-up, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the main source of income for the family is the small monthly salaries earned by Mamia\u2019s sons. Two of them are working as bakers and the youngest is in military service. For additional income, Mamia cultivates family-owned agricultural land where he grows different kinds of vegetables. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMamia has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business, and his loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Mamia will start up a small dairy farm. He will purchase a milk cow and a piglet with the loan funds. With the milk from the cow, the family will make cheese products and sell these locally at the market.

","en":"Gulnora is a skilled seamstress, having begun sewing in her childhood.  She sews beautiful national dresses for women.  She also skillfully embroiders beads and decorative flowers that she uses to adorn her dresses.  Her talent is masterful.  As a youth, she took lessons from a skilled artisan.  There, she learned all the details of her craft.  As Gulnora herself has said, her teacher was very demanding but managed to pass along her skills and mold her into the talent she is today.  When Gulnora started her family and had three children, the need for income increased and she decided to open her own shop.  Six years ago, she and a few of her seamstress friends rented a space near a market.  initially, Gulnora used a sewing machine that she rented with the space.  But she later decided she wanted to buy a new sewing machine for herself.  For the means to do so, she turned to Arvand.  With their support, she did just that.  Now, with the increasing needs of her family, she wants to buy her own embroidery machine.  With this machine, her small business will be able to survive and she will be able to continue to offer her services to a larger number of clients.  This will allow her to earn enough money for her family and her children's education.  She hopes that this loan from Arvand will help her advance closer to her goals and to move past this difficult time.

To earn an income, she buys and sells dried fruit.  Umatoy brings in her products from a neighboring city and sells them in her village.  She has many clients.  Umatoy has turned to Arvand for a loan.  She has problems with her teeth and has since her childhood when she constantly visited dentists.  Now that she's 48, she has almost no teeth remaining.  Umatoy is taking out a loan to receive dental treatment and would like to have metal-ceramic crowns put in.  They are very expensive but she needs them as she is unable to eat food normally which is very difficult for her.  Umatoy has been saving up for this, but she's just short of the total amount.  She hopes that Arvand will support her and that she will be able to heal her teeth."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.12,"image":{"id":1303855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"for dental treatment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T19:00:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":102.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":106.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":113.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":117.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":122.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":130.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":135.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":140.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":144.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":149.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.26,"local_amount":102.73,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863729,"comment":null},{"amount":23.04,"local_amount":106.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":109.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572676,"comment":null},{"amount":23.84,"local_amount":110.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":113.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971446,"comment":null},{"amount":24.68,"local_amount":113.9,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":117.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751960,"comment":null},{"amount":25.54,"local_amount":117.89,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":121.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616034,"comment":null},{"amount":26.44,"local_amount":122.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":125.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859905,"comment":null},{"amount":27.36,"local_amount":126.28,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":130.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136651,"comment":null},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":130.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900847,"comment":null},{"amount":29.31,"local_amount":135.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":139.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550033,"comment":null},{"amount":30.33,"local_amount":140.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":144.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774261,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-04T06:58:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533070,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene, age 43, runs a general store business to earn an income.

","en":"Davlat is married and lives in Istaravshan, Tajikistan with his wife and two children.  He's a hardworking and honest man. His wife raises their children and does not work outside of the home.  Davlat has worked the last four years buying and selling auto parts; this is the family's sole source of income.

is 41 years old. He lives in Sachkhere District with his wife, retired mother and two children who are going to school. Besik requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesik is working as a builder on private orders. His family has one milk cow, and Besik\u2019s wife is milking it everyday to make cheese. They sell it locally at the market and get a very small monthly income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs within the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesik requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor which do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Besik will purchase a mini-bus to transport building materials. He will work on transportation and earn additional monthly income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will help him to develop his business which will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

It has eight members and an executive board, with Susana as president. The members of the group are engaged in various activities, among them cattle trading, baby-clothes sewing, api (a popular drink made with sweetcorn and sugar, usually drunk while eating dumplings) sales, catering, and lamb-meat sales. This loan will thus benefit a group of very small entrepreneurs with diverse businesses. Susana tells us that she has been working with Pro Mujer for two years. She got to know this field partner thanks to a spokesperson, who came to visit her at her house. Susana sells api, a trade she learned from her family, who has been in it for thirty years. She decided to start selling the drink on her own. She needs this loan in order to increase her working capital and buy api and cooking oil. She will buy these from wholesale sellers in La Paz and then sell the product in her neighbourhood.The income Susana derives from her business enables her to help with household expenses, since she is married and has four children. When asked what she likes about working with Pro Mujer, she talks about the training received on topics such as health and credit options."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":1304699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cooking oil and api (a traditional drink).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aorelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22786.25,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2352.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2270.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":340.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":328.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":340.63,"local_amount":2352.02,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2353.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914415,"comment":null},{"amount":328.85,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625404,"comment":null},{"amount":328.84,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021361,"comment":null},{"amount":328.85,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809169,"comment":null},{"amount":328.85,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669239,"comment":null},{"amount":657.69,"local_amount":4541.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915006,"comment":null},{"amount":328.84,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197647,"comment":null},{"amount":328.85,"local_amount":2270.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153421,"comment":null},{"amount":328.6,"local_amount":2268.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T02:46:36Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:41:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533102,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is 30 years old, married, and has two children.

She comes from Managua, in the West of the country. She likes to cook and share with her children a local delicacy, named 'g\u00fcirilas', which are a type of sweetcorn pancake. Due to her lack of financial resources, she was not able to go to university, but she would have liked to study nutrition. Thanks to her enterprising spirit and her desire to get ahead in life, she has her own business: a taxi service. She drives people around the city some twelve hours per day. She is happy to have this business, as this is what feeds her and her children. She needs the loan to perform maintenance on her taxi by greasing some parts as well as changing what needs to be changed: the tyres, the brakes, and the valve.

He used the previous loan to buy fruits, vegetables and drinks, like soda, water and juice, and he has paid back his loan successfully.  He will use this new loan to buy a water container and to buy items his store is now lacking, like beans, wheat flour, mangoes and pineapples. He dreams of owning a wholesale shop.\r\n\r\nSamwel will share this loan with his loan group, Classic, which is comprised of 10 members, including Samwel. They will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":1303735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a

age 53, is a farmer. He lives in a village in the Tskaltubo district with his wife, 20-year-old daughter and a mother who is provided with a retirement pension. Sulkhan keeps busy running the family's small-scale agricultural business. He owns a vineyard and produces wine with the harvested grapes. Also, he runs a dairy farm with four milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold at the local open market. \r\n\r\nSulkhan has requested credit for the purpose of building a greenhouse. The new business will be an additional source of income for the family, which will allow them to combat the poverty in which they live. \r\n\r\nSulkhan\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to the country's rural poor, who often do not have access to credit, as they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Sulkhan will purchase materials for the greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where tomatoes and greens will be grown throughout the year. Sulkhan will work in the greenhouse himself. He will sell the harvested products at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase, and they will be able to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1303814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase building materials and construct a greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Maghlaki","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-03T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-02T23:00:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulkhan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":155.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":158.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":178.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":188.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":194.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.59,"local_amount":136.48,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":138.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570271,"comment":null},{"amount":90.46,"local_amount":147.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968903,"comment":null},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":150.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":152.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749321,"comment":null},{"amount":95.52,"local_amount":155.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613227,"comment":null},{"amount":97.37,"local_amount":158.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856951,"comment":null},{"amount":100.18,"local_amount":163.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":165.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133610,"comment":null},{"amount":103.66,"local_amount":169.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":171.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107210,"comment":null},{"amount":562.23,"local_amount":917.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":929.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254783,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T21:33:02Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:25:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533143,"name":"Angelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelita is a 26-year-old married woman and a mother of three children from San Miguel, Bohol.\r\n\r\nAngelita has been engaged in a rice-farming business together with her husband for more than eight years now.

She already has a lot of customers who prefer her because her product is fresh, well-priced, and of high quality, and there is excellent service. Rosa is an entrepreneurial woman, dedicated to her work and with a lot of desire to move ahead. She is always looking for alternatives that will allow her to achieve success. In the last few weeks demand has increased, and she wants to take advantage of it to make a new investment, but she does not have sufficient capital to back her in this. That is why she is asking Integral for a loan that will allow her to buy wholesale fruits and vegetables. Rosa Amelia has good payment references. She is thankful for the support and says that she will be able to pay the debt. At the same time she is confident that she will give her family a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1304742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase wholesale fruit and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T00:10:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":49.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.57,"local_amount":37.57,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":37.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448326,"comment":null},{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":38.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":38.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451478,"comment":null},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":40.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":40.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082592,"comment":null},{"amount":180.26,"local_amount":180.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":180.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382265412,"comment":null},{"amount":252.91,"local_amount":252.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":252.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390740014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T14:58:32Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:33:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533093,"name":"Ronalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronalyn generates income by selling grocery items to the people in her village.

He is married and lives with his wife and three children in Kobuleti District. His mother is provided with a retirement pension and his son goes to school. Genadi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGenadi has a car and works as a taxi driver. He serves local people and earns income. It makes a total of 500 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nGenadi has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 percent.

It is made up of 9 members and is directed by a board of directors, where Modesta is the president.  The businesses that the group members are a part of are varied and include activities such as selling linaza juice (a local fruit), wood finishing, running a convenience store, selling food, jewel crafting, knitting sweaters, and knitting backpacks.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will help small businesses that Modesta is a part of.  She comments that this is the first loan that she is making with Pro Mujer.  She is making it due to an invitation from a promoter of the institution that went to visit her at her house.  Currently, she runs a convenience store.  She started this business several years ago, but at first her business only sold breakfast foods.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is getting is to increase her capital (buy rice, oil, and noodles) that she will get from the markets in the city of La Paz.  The goods she buys will then be sold at her place of business.  This form of work allows her to generate income to sustain her house (she is married and has a son).\r\n\r\nWhen asked what it is that she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the loans and the health support.\r\n\r\nThis group is accompanied by their credit consultant, Francisca, who is pictured in the green sweater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1304748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy rice, oil, and noodles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nitza Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Regina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nery Delma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27272.7,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4204.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4613.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4613.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4613.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4613.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4615.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":608.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":668.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":668.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":668.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":668.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":668.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":608.92,"local_amount":4204.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4207.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625407,"comment":null},{"amount":668.16,"local_amount":4613.31,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021364,"comment":null},{"amount":668.16,"local_amount":4613.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809172,"comment":null},{"amount":668.16,"local_amount":4613.31,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669242,"comment":null},{"amount":1336.6,"local_amount":9228.51,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":9235.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915008,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T22:49:50Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:02:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533152,"name":"Tovmas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tovmas is a young farmer from Horom village of Shirak region.

His loan requests were rejected because of his family's low income and poor living conditions. The sources of income for Shota's family are the seasonal income from selling harvested maize grown on the family-owned land. Besides the maize, he raises three pigs and sells piglets. \r\n\r\nThe income totals 100 laris per month and is hardly enough to provide food for a family of three. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nShota requested a loan from Credo to restart his family business, which was stopped because of financial problems. His loan request was approved by a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are often regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

That is why she started tailoring at home to support her family well.\r\n\r\nMs. Naseem has gradually improved her business with the support of Kashf Foundation.

He is 33 years old and lives with his wife, two children and parents. Merab requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a small scale business start-up without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source for the family is the small monthly income earned by Merab working as a joiner on private orders, but he doesn\u2019t have enough income to make savings and set up a workshop. The family also runs an agricultural business and grows citrus and nuts on the agricultural land. The harvested products are sold seasonally in the local district.  In addition, Merab\u2019s father is involved in dairy farming and has a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese products. \r\n\r\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start up a joiner\u2019s workshop. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to countryside rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit he will purchase wooden materials and a joiner\u2019s plane. \r\n\r\nMerab is sure that his start-up business will be successful, as his district is quite popular among tourists. Thus, small hostels are being constructed. Merab will supply them with quality furniture for a convenient price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the income of his family.

As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity.

is 59 years old. He is married and lives in the Martvili District with his wife and 12 year old son. Ramin requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nRamin is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has 2 milk cows and a pig. Besides, he has 500 nut trees and a vineyard with 200 vine trees. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\nRamin requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

The house the family lives in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair.

So he is requesting a loan of 4,500,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, including but not limited to fiberglass, hardwood floors, glue and wallpaper. During this time of year, the price of building materials reaches its lowest rate so it is a good time to buy these materials. \r\n\r\nAfter the repairs have been made, the family will be able to live with joy and happiness due to having a warm house. This also will enable the family to burn less coal, thereby reducing air pollution. (In Mongolia, air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal.)

They sell the harvested nuts locally. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

He lives in the south side of town with his family, which is made up of his family, his wife and two children, aged 3 and 13. Two years ago, Ariel started a business selling groceries on credit. He had worked for 24 years in a photography business where he lost his job. He decided to become independent by selling basic necessity products to his neighbors and friends. With them he was recommended and his customers slowly grew in number. He buys directly from wholesalers and gets good discounts, selling on credit. Because of this, he doesn't always have the working capital he needs to respond to his growing and potential clientele. That is why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy groceries and cleaning products, because he plans on increasing his sales again by offering competitive prices, because he will pass the discounts from his suppliers on to his customers. His goal is to duplicate his sales so he can finish his home and finally offer his family a better well being.

At the age of 17, he moved with his family to the city of Barranquilla. \r\n\r\nSo as not to lose the connection with his hometown, he started his own business, intuitively interpreting the needs of the market segment, how to access the excellent food products produced in Santa Cruz de Mompox, and finally with his own life experience, he managed to transport goods for daily consumption to Baranquilla and sell them in a market. That was how he gained his first experience - selling whey, cheese and corn rolls to freinds and neighbors. \r\n\r\nGradually the quality of the products he was selling got its own results and today he has an established clientele and a good reputation in the market. He has also acquired working capital, which he invests in his business and with the profits, he maintains his home, and has even managed to enter the market of buying and selling cattle which he does in his hometown. \r\n\r\nLately, faced with the acquiring all the products that he sells to meet growing demand, and faced with the necessity to strengthen his cattle business, he has found that his working capital is insufficient to achieve this, so he is requesting a loan to buy cheese, rolls, whey, cookies and a bull. This is the third loan that he will receive from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this assistance, he is able to increase his liquidity, sales and profits. In this same way, he was able to finish building the second floor of his home which makes him feel satisfied and eager to continue working to increase his chances of well-being and achieve his dreams of prosperity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1362.08,"image":{"id":1109069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cheese, rolls, buttermilk, cookies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":216383},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":227141},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":231873},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":236704},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":241635},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":246669},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":251808},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":257054},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":262409},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":267876},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":273457},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":286991}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":216383,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":219477.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498036,"comment":null},{"amount":126.82,"local_amount":227141,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":230389.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527853,"comment":null},{"amount":129.47,"local_amount":231873,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":235189.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928597,"comment":null},{"amount":132.16,"local_amount":236704,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":240089.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705747,"comment":null},{"amount":134.91,"local_amount":241635,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-25T08:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":245091.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968039,"comment":null},{"amount":137.72,"local_amount":246669,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":250197.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817235,"comment":null},{"amount":140.6,"local_amount":251808,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-23T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":255409.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323507,"comment":null},{"amount":143.52,"local_amount":257054,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":260730.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082747,"comment":null},{"amount":146.51,"local_amount":262409,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":266162.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062124,"comment":null},{"amount":149.56,"local_amount":267876,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":271707.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731821,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-21T18:30:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533482,"name":"Mohamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamad is 25 years old and single.

The business brings in around 15,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zinakan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to increase the assortment of children's goods. Zinakan will invest the income from the loan in further developing her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1305347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To  increase the assortment of children goods for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karakol town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-04T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-03T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zinakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9315},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9579},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9850},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10129},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10416},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.56},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":197.94,"local_amount":9315,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9410.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754928,"comment":null},{"amount":203.56,"local_amount":9579,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9676.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458955,"comment":null},{"amount":209.31,"local_amount":9850,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9950.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863088,"comment":null},{"amount":664.19,"local_amount":31256,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-27T08:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31575.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T00:34:19Z","paid_date":"2013-07-27T08:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":533490,"name":"Alaywi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaywi is an Iraqi client who is 52 years old and has two wives and two children.
