Thanks to the good quality of her work, now she has a contract with a very good company to start providing third-party services.\r\n\r\nThis is why she needs a loan to buy a flat-bed sewing machine and supplies to begin sewing.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her business accredited and improve it so her income improves and her son can have a better education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1206960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a flat-bed sewing machine and sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Andes","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-10-06T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-05T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleny Paticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65264},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67087},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68961},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70888},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72868},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74904},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76997},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79148},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81359},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83632},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85969},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88370},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90839},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93377},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95986},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98668},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101424},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104259}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":73582,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":74930.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640853,"comment":null},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":58769,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":59846.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029978,"comment":null},{"amount":56.01,"local_amount":98841,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100652.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331166054,"comment":null},{"amount":23.24,"local_amount":41008,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":41759.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548602,"comment":null},{"amount":293.84,"local_amount":518547,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":528050.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098477,"comment":null},{"amount":401.91,"local_amount":709253,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":722251.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517702,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-07T15:06:05Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:17:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479169,"name":"Marino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marino, de 34 a\u00f1os, es un hombre trabajador y amable.

She works hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nCarol has a bean curd pudding business and goes around in the community to sell it. \"Taho\" in Tagalog, bean curd pudding is famous in the Philippines and normally is sold in the morning. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 13,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCarol hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to give her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He raises livestock and grows crops, mainly wheat and barley.  His wife helps him with his work.\r\n\r\nSobir used to travel to Russia to find work, but he did not have a permanent job there.  He has now been involved in animal husbandry and crop production for more than five years.  Thanks to his income, he has been able to improve the living conditions of his household.\r\n\r\nThis year, Sobir sowed barley on two hectares (4.94 acres) of land, but because of bad weather, crop production was lower than anticipated. This is why he has turned to our organization and requested a loan to buy some livestock and expand his animal husbandry business.\r\n\r\nSobir is relying on your

Vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo, sus hijos y 2 nietos, instalados en su propia casa.

Atiende amablemente a sus clientes desde muy temprano y afortunadamente le va muy bien. Empez\u00f3 con un apoyo financiero de MFP, comprando sus productos en peque\u00f1as cantidades. Ya tiene un a\u00f1o dedic\u00e1ndose a este trabajo y ha logrado crecer a base de mucho esfuerzo y en todo este tiempo ha podido consolidar una buena clientela. Trabaja sola aunque en algunas ocasiones recibe la ayuda de su hija. Considera que su negocio es rentable por las ganancias que a diario obtiene por todas sus ventas. Su negocio le permite estar en casa para poder atender a sus nietos ya que los quiere mucho y vela por ellos, adem\u00e1s los ingresos econ\u00f3micos que obtiene le sirven para comprar todo lo que hace falta en su hogar. Por tanto tiene deseos de  crecer y ampliar su bodega hasta convertirla en un bazar donde pueda vender diversos productos que el cliente solicita. Este es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 5 con MFP, es por eso que agradece a todas las personas que hacen posible su cr\u00e9dito para continuar realizando su trabajo con mejores resultados.

Tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1 sacos de yuca porque la temporada de ventas de este producto promete buenas ganancias. \n\n","en":"Elena is 57 years old and is a happy and hard working woman, as well as friendly and cheerful.

She lives with her husband, children and two grandchildren all in their own house. \r\n\r\nElena's business is the sale of general groceries, for which she established a store in her own house. She also complements her sales with the sale of cassava. She attends to her customers in a friendly manner from early in the morning and it is fortunately going very well for her. She began with the financial support of MFP by buying her products in small quantities. She already has a year of experience with this work and has grown her base with much effort and in all this time she has been able to consolidate a good clientele. She works alone but at times receives her daughter's help. She considers her business profitable for the daily earnings that she receives from her sales. \r\n\r\nHer business allows her to be at home to care for her grandchildren because she loves them very much and watches over them. In addition, the earnings that she obtains allows her to buy anything that is needed for her home. She has hopes to grown and expand her store to convert it into a business where she can sell diverse products that her clientele requests. This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is thankful to all those who have made these credits possible so she can continue her work with improved results. On another hand she is committed to fulfilling her payments punctually like she has done with previous loans. She will also buy sacks of cassava because the season for this product promises good earnings. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1207064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sugar, rice, oils and sacks of cassava.

is 48 years old and lives in the town of Bugiri in the Iganga region of Uganda. He is widowed and has four children, with three of them currently in school. For the past two years, Robert has been working hard to manage his grocery, which sells sugar, rice, maize flour and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Robert has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food goods like beans and rice to refill the shop, and will help Robert to generate greater profits and educate his children well. Robert hopes that, in the future, he will be able to shift from retail to wholesale. \r\n\r\nRobert is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

She has been running this business for 3 years. She works at the business from 7am until 6 pm, 7 days per week. The business is the only source of income she has.

She uses this to have more sales.\r\n\r\nRosaline has requested a loan in order to purchase a variety of stock, like rubber buckets, radios, clothes and ladies' bags. The extra income from this loan will allow her to improve her family income. In the future, she wants to expand her business.

She lives in the company of Alex, her spouse of 8 years. Together they have three children who they care for in their house which they bought three years ago. She has adapted to her husband's family's business which is their primary economic activity: the raising of pigs and the preparation of lech\u00f3n (a typical Peruvian dish made of pork). Her work consists of the preparation of this substantial dish, which she does at least three times a week. They sell the lech\u00f3n at parties throughout the Mantaro Valley. Thanks to this, they know many diverse towns and their customs. Preparation goes really well, but she says that it's very tiring to travel with and move an enormous cooked pig. But her her efforts are rewarded because many praise the good seasoning of the lech\u00f3n. However right now it is planting season, so Milagros will begin to plant corn in the agricultural land that she inherited, and she is sure she will have much sucess. \r\n\r\nMilagros belongs to the communal bank Sicaya 2000. This will be loan number 11 for this group working with MFP. She feels happy because in this time she has achieved many gains thanks to the financial support they have provided her. For this reason she promises to comply with the repayment plan. What's more, she likes working in her association where all the women are supportive and hard-workers. \r\n\r\nMilagros will invest the money in the purchase of natural fertilizers for the planting of \"chulpe\" corn, which is characterized by its yellow colour. The rest will be invested in improving her oven. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1205067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy natural fertilizers and fix her oven","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-06T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-05T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagros ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529176,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-20T18:12:51Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478528,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She likes carrying on her businesses,as she can manage her free time to look after her small children, whom she loves very much and who are her motivation for success. In addition, she feels happy about the income her business generates, and with which she is able to help her partner pay the household expenses. \r\n\r\nIt bothers her when her customers are behind in paying their credit, but that does not discourage her. Therefore, she has plans to continue working; as she feels good, and is satisfied with her activities, as they give her the independence she needs. \r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with the MFP institution, so she is grateful to the people who make her loan possible and give her the opportunity to continue working to achieve her objectives.

is 25 years old. She is from Cabawan District, Tagbilaran City. She is married with two young sons, ages 4 and 6.\r\n\r\nAna sells vegetables in the city proper in order to generate an income for her family. She also raises chickens for additional revenue. \r\n\r\nAna is asking for a loan of 13,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) to buy vegetables like eggplant, squash, string beans, bamboo shoots and bitter gourd.

His principal crop is coffee. He learned this activity from working at the side of his parents, who later bequeathed him a parcel of land so that he could work it when he married. He and his wife Tolentina have four children, and to be able to raise his family, Eusebio also works as a loader at a coffee processor. In the last harvest, Eusebio's production was five tons, and for the next harvest he needs to buy fertilizers and do cleaning work on his parcel of land. For this reason, he is applying for a loan. In this way he will increase his production, and he has a goal of buying a new plot of land.

He is working hard on including the glass in his business, which will be a good step towards a wider market.\r\n\r\nHe is looking forward to his new life and for this important step he is going to take.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1205797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To pay for his marriage legal documents and to finish pasting tiles in his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T05:00:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310164,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331050535,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440465,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993155,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735764,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441152,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846387,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614619,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472127,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728232,"comment":null},{"amount":87,"local_amount":87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997173,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-09T11:50:22Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:10:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478590,"name":"Leila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leila is from Iraq.

He offers his services as a bricklayer and works on construction jobs in different provinces and in the city.  Eleuterio also has dairy cows, three of which are producing and another that is pregnant.  He delivers the milk to a processor for making cheese and other dairy products, which are then sold in a town near his community.  In addition, Eleuterio grows potatoes and sells his harvest in the market square once a year.  \r\n<p>\r\nEleuterio took out his first Kiva loan in August 2010.  The loan he requested was used to build and improve the rooms in his home because he was starting a family.  He is very grateful for that loan because it gave him the opportunity to improve his home and provide his wife a better space to live as a family.  \r\n<p>\r\nEleuterio is currently growing in his construction jobs, so he wants to buy a cement mixer that he needs for his work.  He already has contracts to perform more work, so he is requesting his second loan.  Eleuterio now has a daughter who is 1\u00bd years old, so he is very pleased that he started his family two years ago.  He wants to improve his family\u2019s living conditions for the future.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875.12,"image":{"id":596590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy a cement mixer.

She sells seafood including shrimp, fish and conch. She has several years of experience with small businesses which has given her valuable experience. Irma always gets the best profits from sales, and the place where she does business is very crowded with people.  She has many customers who prefer her because everything she sells is top quality, fresh and at reasonable prices. But more than anything she provides excellent service. Irma is an enterprising woman, dedicated to her work and is eager to get ahead and create a more prosperous future. She knows that it will take all of her effort and persistence to reach this goal that she so wants.

She lives with her husband and their three children who are between 12 and 19 years old.  Idalis owns a workshop where she makes men's, women's and children's clothing.  For many years Idalis worked making clothing for third parties.  Large companies would deliver the items of clothing to her already cut out so that she would sew them together in her workshop and finish them off using her creative skills.  Eight years ago, she decided to start working for herself and start her own business so that she could be closer to her three children and take care of them while she made money to improve their well-being.  Now Idalis makes shirts, pants, blouses and Bermuda shorts which she sells to neighbors and family members.  She has the support of her sister who delivers her products to other towns near Soledad where she lives.  \r\n\r\nIdalis is applying for this Kiva loan to buy materials for her business such as fabric, buttons and thread.

This, in turn, will help her to achieve one of her business goals: to increase her production so that she can make better income for the benefit of her family.

small land and it is where Yader lives.  Yader is a 32-year-old man who earns a living working as an elementary school teacher in a neighboring region.  In order to improve himself, he is studying for a teacher training degree on weekends so that he will have his degree and therefore a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOwing to the low salaries that are paid in our country, many people are unable to fulfill their dreams of training to become a professional, doing the same for their children and managing to own a decent home.  However, there are also tenacious people who seek a way to achieve their goals.  This is the case for Yader who has requested a loan to pay his university fees so that he won't face any obstacles in obtaining his teaching degree.\r\n\r\nYader is grateful to Kiva and Ceprodel for the support they have given him through these loans which help him to solve personal problems which, owing to the low salaries in our country, he would otherwise be unable to solve.\r\n\r\n*(line from a well-known Nicaraguan song)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1207555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay university fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T10:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T10:50:19Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yader Eulogio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":353},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":458.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":468.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":482.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":507.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":513.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":531.49},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":545.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":563.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":575.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.89,"local_amount":353,"processed_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":378.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322964799,"comment":null},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":458.59,"processed_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":491.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331950978,"comment":null},{"amount":21.07,"local_amount":468.16,"processed_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":501.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339488979,"comment":null},{"amount":21.72,"local_amount":482.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":517.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347041667,"comment":null},{"amount":22.83,"local_amount":507.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":543.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356473577,"comment":null},{"amount":23.1,"local_amount":513.36,"processed_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":550.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364493560,"comment":null},{"amount":23.92,"local_amount":531.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":569.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373114870,"comment":null},{"amount":24.56,"local_amount":545.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":585.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381674559,"comment":null},{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":563.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":604.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390538846,"comment":null},{"amount":25.91,"local_amount":575.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":617.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788097,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-07T14:53:01Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478615,"name":"Hilaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hilaria is 57 years old and from Antequera, Bohol.

He was able to study social communication at the Public University of Valle because he received financial support from the state for his excellent academic record and his family's limited financial situation.  Currently, Alejandro and his brother only have their mother's financial support since his father died some time ago.  \r\n\r\nAlejandro is passionate about technology and his dream is to study for a Master's degree in sound design in the United Kingdom.  Once he is admited to one of the best universities in Colombia, he is sure that his good grades, media experience, and social projects will allow him to receive a grant to finance his studies.  Now, he is asking for this Kiva loan because it is the only way he can pay for a TOEFL preparation course and the exam fee, which are the first things he has to do to achieve his dream.  \r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nThe great passion of my life is music and sound.  I have received music education since I was very young.  I started studying my first musical instrument when I was eight years old.  More recently I have participated in opportunities that have allowed me to develop my talent and that of many other young people for social transformation through the media, spreading messages of well-being, hope, knowledge, and development.\r\n\r\nMovies are another one of my hobbies, and for that reason I have worked on short and long films since high school.  I made academic and financial effort to study at the school of social communication at the University of Valle, which is known for its emphasis on audiovisual studies and its alumni filmmakers.  \r\n\r\nFor the last few years, I have been developing and participating in projects that fuse audiovisual with music and sound.  I have a music blog and have played in groups.  I have designed some sound pieces for short films being edited and I have also worked as a DJ.\r\n\r\nHowever, at this time my dream is to bring my talent to the next level and that is why I want to learn the art of sound design from the best.  I have chosen to study in the United Kingdom, among other reasons, because of the affinity I feel for their contribution to world culture through music and their world famous quality in sound engineering.  \r\n\r\nOnce I return to this country, I dream of contributing socially in Colombia by creating my own digital media company where I advise young people from marginalized areas on audiovisual techniques, using social media, and community video oriented to sound, music, and sound design.\r\n\r\nThe support of Kiva is without doubt the most important tool that I have to take the first step necessary to achieve my dream.  This loan will cover the cost of a preparation course for the English proficiency exam as well as the cost of enrolling at one of the universities I plan to apply to.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.33,"image":{"id":1208304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay his application costs for a Master's degree in Sound Design for Film and Television.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75009.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042088,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":75009.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710435,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-08T02:27:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":479668,"name":"Aida Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aida tiene 27 a\u00f1os y trabaja en un negocio que hered\u00f3 de su familia.

She sells them directly to retailers and factories in the city of Barranquilla and in the municipality in which she lives. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan with Kiva because she wants to buy a large amount of fabric scraps, a ton, to make sure that she always has enough fabric scraps to make wipes because oftentimes there is a supply shortage.

Her business is offering salon services to the residents in the area where she lives. Many people from her neighborhood and from others go directly to her business to get their hair cut, improve their image and buy beauty products such as creams, shampoos and other merchandise.

She is married and has two children aged 35 and 27. In 2007, she established her grocery store business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used it to buy grocery goods for her business. In the future, Dhan Kumari plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasal, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.

In the future, Durga plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the

Hace 5 anos que empez\u00f3 este negocio como su forma de empleo, pues con tan pocas oportunidades laborales en la ciudad, decidi\u00f3 emprender su propia aventura de negocios. Inicialmente vendi\u00f3 productos mediante una sola revista o gu\u00eda especializada y posteriormente en sus \u00faltimos 5 a\u00f1os, sigui\u00f3 aumentando su oferta de productos y ahora vende ropa interior, blusas, perfumes y calzados.

She has a business whereby she sells perfume and merchandise by catalogue to neighbours and friends in her neighbourhood, going door to door managing to generate income that benefits the livelihood of her home. Five years ago she started this business as a form of employment, with so few job opportunities in the city, she decided to start her own business venture. Initially she sold merchandise through only one magazine or specialized guide and in the last 5 years, continued to increase her product offerings and now sells undergarments, blouses, perfume and footwear. \r\n\r\nYulieth is applying for a Kiva loan to buy more of these products, to sell to her customers. These products are currently at very good discounts and the objective is to take advantage of these offers to gain new customers and increase her revenue and this is precisely the success of her Kiva loan investment. With two small children, Yulieth wants very much to improve the lives of family therefore, one of her goals is to save revenue of her business to buy a family car and to make her distribution job easier as well as to share more in her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1208320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy undergarments, blouses, perfume and footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-07T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-06T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yulieth Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70298},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":78471},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80302},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82176},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84093},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86056},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88064},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90118},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92221},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94373},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96575},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107253}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.17,"local_amount":70298,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":72315.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994386,"comment":null},{"amount":44.84,"local_amount":78471,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80723.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130733,"comment":null},{"amount":92.84,"local_amount":162478,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":167141.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519591,"comment":null},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":84093,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":86506.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071433,"comment":null},{"amount":49.18,"local_amount":86056,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":88525.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527463,"comment":null},{"amount":101.82,"local_amount":178182,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":183296.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928230,"comment":null},{"amount":52.7,"local_amount":92221,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94867.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967694,"comment":null},{"amount":170.4,"local_amount":298201,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":306759.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816908,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T16:32:39Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":478895,"name":"Yon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yon is 59 years old, widowed and resides with her daughter and grandchild in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia.

They have one unit of tricycle that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business, the regular customers are the local community members. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and accessories and also to pay for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNenita dreams to be able to give her family a good life and hopes to give her children and grandchildren a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business.
