compuesta por ocho integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Nila es la Tesorera. Los negocios que las integrantes de la asociaci\u00f3n comunal llevan adelante son variados entre ellos tenemos: elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de mantas, tejido de chompas, costura de pantalones, venta de verduras, elaboraci\u00f3n de mantas de alpaca, tienda de barrio, hilado y venta de lana de vicu\u00f1a.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que sacaran beneficiara a peque\u00f1as microempresarias donde la se\u00f1ora Nila es una integrante, ella indica que hace seis meses que integra Pro Mujer, ingresando por invitaci\u00f3n de una promotora de la instituci\u00f3n que fue a su casa. En la actualidad ella tiene un negocio de hilado y venta de lana de vicu\u00f1a; nos cuenta que este negocio lo adquiri\u00f3 cuando se encontraba sin trabajo, pero sab\u00eda la elaboraci\u00f3n de hilo de vicu\u00f1a, desde esa fecha ella trabaja en ese negocio.\n \nEl cr\u00e9dito que ahora sacar\u00e1 es para el aumento de capital (compra de lana de vicu\u00f1a) mismo que adquiere de las ferias de las provincias y posteriormente lo comercializar\u00e1 en su puesto de venta. Esta forma de trabajo le permite generar recursos para apoyar en lo posible a su familia, pues ella vive en concubinato y tiene dos hijos.  \n\nCuando se le consulta que le gusta de Pro Mujer, ella responde que le gusta el ahorro.\n\n","en":"The communal bank \"Los Angeles\" [The Angels] is going to start its second round in Pro Mujer, as part of the regional hub of Villa Adela. It has eight members and it's run by a board where Nila is the treasurer. The businesses that the members of the communal bank carry out are varied and among them there are: making and selling blankets, weaving sweaters, pants sewing, selling vegetables, making alpaca blankets, grocery stores, sale and yarn of vicuna wool.\r\n\r\nThe loan that are requesting will benefit small micro businesses where Nila is a member. She says that she entered Pro Mujer six months ago, entering by invitation of a promoter of the institution who went to her home. She currently runs a business that yarns and sells vicuna wool. She states that she purchased this business when she was unemployed, because she knew to elaborate vicuna yarn. From that date, she works in the business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she will receive is to increase working capital (to buy vicuna wool).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Originally from the Kror Kor district of Pursat Province, Yoeurn is a mother of four children: two sons who are helping with the family's business, while the remaining two are working for others for a fee. To strive for a living, she has been planting paddy rice on two hectares of farmland as the main source of income. Her husband helps to earn additional income via producing sugar palm for sale. Having been with this business for 26 years, she is able to earn about 17,000 KHR per day in average.  The main challenges which lower her yields are the drought, insects, and the declining price of rice. \r\n\r\nTo tackle these challenges, she is forming a group of two female members to seek a new loan. For this cycle, she is the fifth loan cycle and her member is the third loan cycle with Kiva partner VisionFund.

is a 40-year-old married woman. She has five children whose ages range from four to 21 years. She describes herself as an influential woman. She operates a farm where she sells vegetables such as cabbage, kale and tomatoes. She has been involved in this business for two years and employs one staff member. Her business is located in a less-competitive area and her primary customers are local residents, hotels, and wholesalers. She identifies her biggest business challenge as problems of transporting her vegetables to the customers.

The rest of her family is living in the Dambae district of Kampong Cham province in which both rice and cassava planting are the common business for the villagers. Not much different from her neighbors, she also manages two hectares of farmland for growing rice and another one hectare area for growing cassava. The current business earns her about 28,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the dropping price of cassava. La has been with VisionFund since 2010 as the first loan cycle.

is a married woman. She has 3 children with ages ranging from 12 years to 23 years. She describes herself to be ambitious and determined. She operates a dairy farm where she sells milk. She has been involved in this business for 15 years and employs 6 staff members. Her business is located in a high-traffic area, and her primary customers are schools, churches, business owners, and local residents.

To strive for her family, she has been growing rice for 16 years as the main source of income. Her husband also helps to generate additional income through cow raising and working for others for a fee. She can earn about 21,000 KHR per day from the current business. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva partner,VisionFund.

She has four sons who are students in the local public school. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, she is a paid worker and her husband is a security guard. Having been in the job for 10 years, she is able to earn about 13,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nShe wants to have a proper shelter for her family, so she is seeking a new loan with VisionFund.

Her store is one of the longest-established in her area. Her principal economic activity, however, is farming and she has 15 years of experience cultivating products such as peas, corn, potatoes and alfalfa (basically as feed for her animals). Her agricultural lands are a bequest from her mother and during the planting season she contracts laborers to help her work the land. During the harvest she sells her products to buyers who come to her, however there are seasons when the price falls and she has to take her crops to sell at the market.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the San Santiago Communal Bank and this is her eleventh loan from MFP.

There I learnt how to interact with people from all walks of life. I think this experience has put me in a good position to deal with customers.\r\n\r\nI am asking for the Kiva loan so that I can purchase a trading booth, pay for my ground rates where I will place my trading booth, and make sure that the trading booth is branded and well furnished so that my customers will have a place to sit. With this loan I will also be able to buy phones, receipt books and some T-shirts so that customers can feel confident to transact with me.\r\n\r\nGetting the Kiva loan means I get to set up my own shop. This will change my life in so many ways because I will finally be able to make my dream of running my own business come true. It will also put me in a position in which I can help my parents who are both retired.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2808.23,"image":{"id":1152567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a trading booth, furniture, and pay for ground rates.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-08-23T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-22T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigail","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":24400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":24400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.6,"local_amount":325000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-26T09:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":326331.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281416,"comment":null},{"amount":1327.28,"local_amount":6477129.4,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6503675.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657055,"comment":null},{"amount":204.92,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T17:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1004098.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347220334,"comment":null},{"amount":1209.43,"local_amount":5902000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T21:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5926188.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355983436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-27T07:34:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":461279,"name":"Dominga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dominga tiene 45 a\u00f1os, vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo e hijos, en la casa que hered\u00f3 de sus padres.\nElla no cuenta con una f\u00e1brica para la elaboraci\u00f3n de ladrillos, pero ello no fue un impedimento, pues alquilo una.

Nazca is one of the cities whose inhabitants are very generous and hospitable. It has a cultural heritage that we Peruvians are very proud of because it contains the Nazca Lines, which were drawn on an extensive field and used in early  Nazca culture for farming since they were a kind of calendar that foretold the coming of the rainy season. Because of these majestic lines, the city welcomes an infinite number of tourists every year. Per\u00fa is also very well known for its gastronomy, however the dish that Elizabeth enjoys most is the delicious \u201cAji de Gallina,\u201d: she says that she could eat this dish every day without ever getting tired of it. \r\n\r\nElizabeth studied until the fifth year of secondary school although she would have liked to have studied university administration, however her parents did not have sufficient means and she had to work since very young to help support the household. She has three children, who are 12, 20 and 22 years old. The youngest is in the first year of secondary school and the older ones are studying at the university. Elizabeth struggles greatly to move her children ahead because she is a single mother and through her dedication is helping them succeed. She wants them to be better than she is and feel pride in having a profession and not experience the hardships she has lived through since childhood.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sells sweets, carbonated beverages and beer. Previously she only sold her products from her tricycle but she saved her money and now has tables so her customers can take a seat. She works about 10 hours a day and can wait on up to 30 customers a day and earn up to S\/.100.

He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy; many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits serve every table in Azerbaijan families and also make fresh punch. He usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 120 AZN (Azerbaijani new manat).\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Fazil wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose, he applied for 1,300 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers. This will be his second loan, and he has a good client history.

Gracias a esto ha logrado salir adelante y permitir que en su hogar sus padres y sus hermanos tengan una mejor calidad de vida. En el negocio le iba tan bien, que un hermano suyo le ayudaba a lavar los carros; pero por problemas de salud su hermano ya no puede trabajar con el y ahora todo el trabajo esta a su cargo. A pesar de que no cuenta con unos recursos f\u00edsicos \u00f3ptimos para desarrollar su actividad, Oscar con mucho esfuerzo logra sacar todos los pedidos del d\u00eda a tiempo, y con sus ingresos se est\u00e1 pagando sus estudios universitarios, pero buscando mejorar sus condiciones de trabajo y agilizar la lavada de los carros, Oscar busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una aspiradora, una manguera, e insumos como jab\u00f3n, cera, trapos, entre otros.\n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es lograr sacar adelante este negocio y que le siga brindando los recursos econ\u00f3micos para pagar su universidad. Adem\u00e1s, espera que su familia siga teniendo una buena calidad de vida y gracias a su negocio puedan progresar econ\u00f3micamente. \n","en":"Oscar comes from a family with scarce financial resources and, in order to help out financially at home, he works washing cars and motorcycles outside his house. He has been doing so since he was thirteen years old, and this has allowed him to get ahead and provide a better quality of life in the home for his parents and siblings.\r\n\r\nThe business was going so well that one of his brothers was helping him wash the cars but, because of health problems, his brother can no longer work with him and now he is in charge of all the work. In spite of not having all the best material resources he would need for his business, Oscar manages to finish all the orders for the day on time with much effort. He is using his income to pay for his college studies. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve his work conditions and speed up the carwashing process, Oscar is requesting a loan in order to purchase a vacuum cleaner, a hose, and supplies such as soap, wax, rags, and other items.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is being able to keep the business going so that it continues to provide him with the financial resources to pay for college. He also hopes his family will continue to have a good quality of life and may advance financially thanks to his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1169616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a vacuum cleaner, a hose, and supplies such as soap, wax, rags, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-08-23T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-22T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71244},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73243},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75298},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77410},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":79582},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81815},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":84110},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86470},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88896},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91390},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93954},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96588}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.97,"local_amount":71244,"processed_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":73327.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433330,"comment":null},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":73354,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75499.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617756,"comment":null},{"amount":43.37,"local_amount":75434,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":77640.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640668,"comment":null},{"amount":44.37,"local_amount":77163,"processed_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":79420.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029771,"comment":null},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":80305,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":82653.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165855,"comment":null},{"amount":46.62,"local_amount":81092,"processed_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83463.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548400,"comment":null},{"amount":49.02,"local_amount":85250,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":87743.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098300,"comment":null},{"amount":49.9,"local_amount":86788,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":89326.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517554,"comment":null},{"amount":212.39,"local_amount":369370,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":380174.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364551789,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-30T19:17:34Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:06:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":463192,"name":"Talalupe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Talalupe is 31 years old and married with no children.

The loan will be used to buy more tomatoes, matoke, clothes and charcoal to sell, and will help Judith to generate greater profits and develop herself.

She has three children, two of whom are dependent on her. She and her husband manage four hectares of paddy rice-growing farmland in order to provide for their family's daily basic needs, earning about KHR 23,000 per day. They have been involved in this business for 26 years. Sykheng's group is composed of two female members. \r\n\r\nSykheng and her co-member have been with VisionFund for four and three cycles, respectively. After the past loans that she has paid, she feels empowered that she can obtain a better living condition for her household. Now she leads her group to seek for a new loan.

is 59 years old and lives in a small village in Martvili district. She lives with her mother and her 23-year-old daughter. Naira\u2019s mother is provided with a retirement pension. Her daughter has chronic health problems and gets a relevant pension from the local government.\r\n\r\nShe had to deal with great difficulties throughout her life, but her determination to get ahead has always allowed her to overcome them and continue progressing with her family.  Naira earns her living through an agricultural business. In particular, she has a plot of land where nuts are grown. She runs a dairy business as well.  Naira has 2 milking cows and a calf. She produces cheese and sells it at the local open market. Naira sells nuts and laurel leaves locally too. Besides her business, she works as a family doctor and gets a monthly salary. She is very hardworking, but still doesn\u2019t make enough savings to expand her agricultural business. \r\n\r\nNaira requested a loan to expand her nut business.

As head of the group Rose is applying for a 1200000 UGX loan from BRAC Uganda. Her loan portion will be 70,0000 UGX, which will be used to buy increased amounts of cassava to sell. This will help her generate greater profits and help pay for school fees for her children. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n<p>\r\nRose\u2019s group loan falls under BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents program.

He is the married father of 2 children, aged 10 years and 3 months. He started working when he was 8 years old. Children, especially rural children, learn from their parents how to cultivate the land. That is why it is the only activity they learn, instead of finishing school. They work in the fields planting basic grains such as beans, corn and wheat. With what Juan sells, he buys materials to keep working as well as other things for his home.His family helps him by selling the products in the same community. When the crops are at their lowest he travels to Costa Rica to seek work as a laborer. He would like to sell his products where they pay more for basic grains. He asked for the loan to buy materials and pay for the labor to plant beans and corn. This loan will be a big help because it will give him better maintenance of the crop and obtain a quality harvest and have more income. Among his plans for the future are buying 2 plots of land. His next goal is to have a succesful harvest and pay off his loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1167921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy materials and pay for labor to plant beans and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-08-23T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-22T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Dionicio  \t\t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":296.4,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":148.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":148.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":148.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332006017,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":148.2,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356531042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-25T01:33:46Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:36:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":463258,"name":"Tram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tram is a 33-year-old woman.

Her youngest son attends a fifth grade.  Kulmairam, left alone after her husband's death, decided to get involved in sales of food products to provide a source of income for her family.  She started this business with a sum of 50,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kulmairam's hard work, today her monthly income amounts to about 10,000 som.  Besides this, she is involved in making pies and baked goods, which also bring in a small income.  In order to further develop her business, Kulmairam requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase her product turnover by purchasing tea, vegetable oil, butter and sugar for making jams.

always necessary for her business.  This is not the first loan that she is obtaining from Kiva.

This time, Svetlana wants to use a loan in the amount of 21,000 hryvnia to purchase tea, coffee, food products and sausage for a subsequent retail sale.  At the present time, all three of Svetlana's daughters attend different education facilities, and she tries to help them financially as she can.

Currently, she is able to buy merchandise at a discount, which will allow her to make an additional profit without raising her prices.

She has a very interesting profession: she travels to schools and childcare centers and puts on various kinds of shows, short plays and concerts for children. At the beginning Magdalina used to work by herself without recruiting any assistants. It was hard at first, but thanks to Magdalina\u2019s resilience she eventually managed to promote her services. At present Magdalina\u2019s sister sometimes helps her out. Magdalina is very talented. She writes poems and songs and is a book author.\r\n\r\nMagalina needs additional funds in the amount of 5,000 UAH in order to buy musical instruments (traditional Ukrainian flutes, psalteries, maracas etc) and children\u2019s toys, which are going to be needed in future performances. Magdalina\u2019s dream is to be able to record  CDs with her songs some day. \r\nIn the future she plans not only perform in the Ukraine but also travel to give performances abroad.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1174376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical

Thanks to her persistent work, Keremetkan currently has 5 dairy cows and their calves, 40 sheep and goats, and 2 horses on her farm. Her farming provides a monthly income of about 4,000 somoni. \r\n\r\nKeremetkan also works 3 hectares of land where she grows potatoes, sunflowers, and corn for livestock feed. The seasonal income from her business allows Keremetkan to pay for her daughter's and son's educations in the capital. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of long-term business development, Keremetkan turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 somoni in order to purchase young livestock.

children. She works in an agricultural administrative office. \r\n\r\nTo supplement her family's income, for the last 12 years Gulsaira has grown crops and raised cattle. Despite beginning with a sum of only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS), thanks to her persistent hard work Gulsaira now has 1 dairy cow and calf, 15 head of sheep and goats, 1 horse, and 1 heifer. Gulsaira also has 1.2 hectares of land where she grows beans, corn and potatoes. The monthly income from her farm is 5,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nGulsaira has contacted the company Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS, in order to further develop her business by purchasing more dairy cows to increase milk production. She plans to use the income generated by this expansion to renovate her barn and improve conditions for raising her animals.

It is going very well and her customer base has grown compared to the number of customers she had when she began.  She knows that to keep her customers happy she must fulfill their orders punctually and provide them with a high-quality product that always meets their expectations.

She comments that her work requires a lot of sacrifice because it's not easy to go out into the streets to sell. Her goal is to have her children become well-educated so that they will not have to suffer the hardships that she has experienced.\r\n\r\nNancy has approached Yehu Microfinance to ask for a loan that will help her to buy seasonal fruits and vegetables to sell. She is grateful to Yehu Microfinance and to Kiva for this great assistance that they are providing, as this loan will be a big help to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1174457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

still under school age. She and her husband earn a living as rice farmers. They also earn additional income by working as paid workers, which they have done for several years. Their current business earns them almost 20,000 KHR per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. They manage to save about 10,000 KHR each day for future needs.\r\n\r\nSavy\u2019s group consists of two members who live in the same village. Savy is in her second cycle with VisionFund. The first loan has helped her relieve the financial burden of everyday expenses for her family and keep some money as savings for building a house.

They both work on a dairy farm producing milk which is then sold to a business that makes many types of dairy produce. Marisol lives in the Maica Chicago area of Cochabamba. It's a long way from the town, and the milk producers in the area have many needs. Marisol is seeking a loan to buy a feeding trough so her cows can feed more easily. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to continue working as a dairy farmer as she has done up to now, to see that her children have a good future, and to one day have enough cows for her children to inherit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1169940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To make a feeding trough for cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-08-24T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-23T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308753174,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315358277,"comment":null},{"amount":1333.34,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322968035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T00:42:42Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:59:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":463646,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is 34 years old and is married with five children, three of whom are currently in school.
