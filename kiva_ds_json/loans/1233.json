is a student of the American University of Central Asia, Department of International and Comparative Politics, and here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery final year students choose their profession. Someone becomes an engineer and plans buildings, someone becomes a doctor and saves lives. Of course, all of those professions are important, but there is one which the whole country or even the world depends on. I think that one is politics. Politicians can change the world. They rule the past, present, and future.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, I realized that I started studying the subject of politics earlier than I thought before. In my secondary school, I was interested in international history. Especially, I was interested in politics and the political system of American politicians. \r\n\r\n\"My favorite politician is Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd president of the United States. I was impressed by his charm, influence, and firmness. Despite his disability, he was not afraid of difficulties and he always worked for his country\u2019s interest. Also, he is the only president of the United States who was elected more than two times, he was elected four times. \r\n\r\n\"Influenced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, I started to get interested in the lives of politicians. In a short period of time, I have read many books, articles, and encyclopedias about famous politicians. So, I opened myself to the big and interesting world of politics. \r\n\r\n\"Browsing through the information brochure and the University\u2019s home page, I felt that undergraduate studying in AUCA can give me a lot. First, it has highly qualified professors with great educational background and working experience. They received their Masters degrees and PhDs in the United States. \r\n\r\n\"After four years of studies at AUCA, I have a definite plan for my future, which is applying for a Masters degree from a university abroad. In order to know more about other political systems and build some experience, I will participate in extra activities such as debates, conferences, and other activities. I will also visit lectures of famous politicians and professors. I am really interested in political science and am ready to devote myself to this very area. \r\n\r\n\"Taking an opportunity, I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, which is open to all AUCA students. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that this is another unique opportunity which AUCA gives to its students. I am happy to be part of such a great university.\u201d

Animals on the farm have been given the name of \"Cheboit.\"\n\nKiprotich was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"They have cheap rates.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"It gives increased income.\"\n\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit his family', Kiprotich replied, \"'Improvement of livelihood.\"\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

","en":"Gulnora is a young hard-working woman. She is 28 years old. She is married and raising two children. Her husband is a work migrant in the Russian Federation. Her children are three and one year old. While still at her parents\u2019 home, she learned how to sew women\u2019s clothing. This trade has helped her a lot in life. Her husband does not make sufficient money to provide the family with all necessities. For over nine years, Gulnora has been working as a seamstress. She provides high-level service and tries to attract new customers. Gulnora has been a client of IMON in the past. She used her prior loans to expand her business, i.e. she bought a new sewing machine of the Chaika brand. She is requesting this loan in order to buy a new overlock sewing machine. She is counting on your kindness and hopes for your compassion."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.81,"image":{"id":1448232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a new overlock sewing machine.

Nasibakhon is 41 years old, widowed, and is raising a daughter. Her daughter is in high school, and is always asking her mother to repair the house, but Nasibakhon's income is not enough to cover it.

Keto has also a son, who lives and works in Austria and helps his family financially.\r\n\r\nAs the majority of middle-aged Georgian women, Keto stays home and takes care of her house. She is an excellent mother and tries to give her children all the best. Keto sorrows that she is not able to generate income for the family; that is why she had decided to start her own business and go to Turkey to purchase apparel and linens to sell.

is a student at the American University of Central Asia, in the Department of International and Comparative Politics, and below is her story.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a little girl, one day I wanted to be a teacher, and the next day I wanted to be a doctor. In the sixth grade, I was elected President of my class. I think that was the time when I started to create myself.\r\n\r\nI was President of my class for five years. This experience taught me to be a responsible leader; it taught me to work in a team. I was a member of the Debate Club at school. I remember that debates about human rights, terrorism or politics were the most interesting for me. I noticed that headlines about politics or laws always attracted my attention. So, when the time came, I had to make a decision about what I wanted to study at college. In the beginning I was asking my family and friends, but then I thought that it was my life and it was only my decision. \r\n\r\nI started thinking about what I liked and what I was good at. I applied to International and Comparative Politics because this is the program that most attracts my attention among the other programs that AUCA offers. I have always been passionate about such subjects as human rights, international organizations, political violence, terrorism, international law and others that the AUCA International Comparative Politics (ICP) program offers. \r\n\r\nI believe that ICP offers education in a field that will always be important, especially for Kyrgyzstan. Specialists with an ICP degree will be in demand on the labor market. My goal is to have a job of a lifetime, that I will be passionate about and that I will love. I think that if a person has a job that he or she likes that person can be really successful in life. If I have a successful career that I love, my family will be proud of me and I will be happy. My ultimate goal is to create change for myself, my family, friends and my country. \r\n\r\nI was a participant in a program called FLEX [Future Leaders Exchange Program]. Living in America was a life-changing experience. I changed my perception of life; I became more active and ambitious. I started to ask questions and look for answers. I just really came to understand the value of life, the value of the time that we have - time that we cannot waste. \r\n\r\nMy American experience was full of things that I had never tried before. For example, I was able to meet people with disabilities. I saw the care system for people with special needs in the U.S and I realized that I had never questioned what was going on with special-needs people in Kyrgyzstan. That experience showed me that I wanted to help people. Maybe one day I will be a governor who will pass acts that will change Kyrgyzstan, or I will work in an international organization that helps Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nThere are some financial difficulties in my family though and therefore I am applying for Kiva loan. This Kiva loan will help me to fully dedicate myself to my education and not to worry about the money that will cover my tuition.\u201d

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of Journalism and Mass Communication, and below is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe first time I went to AUCA was on the 'open day.' I was struck by an amazing and unique atmosphere that prevails at this university. Even the walls emit some kind of furious energy, an energy of joy, desire to learn, to grow and be leaders. Remarkably, there aren\u2019t any universities in our country where it is possible to feel such an amazing spirit of unity and friendship, and a sense that these fifteen hundred students are bold steps to make this world a better place. AUCA also differs in its approach to each student, and a unique system of education. It is the only university in which you can get pleasure from every minute spent here.\r\n\r\nI started thinking about the choice of my future profession a long time ago. At first I wanted to be a linguist, then a psychologist, and then a marketer, and finally, I came to the conclusion that I want to be a journalist. I want journalism to be developed in our country. I want to bring the national media to a new level, to do something new in this area. I want to be a journalist, because this profession opens up the world of people and events, and makes it possible for people to rethink their views and opinions, helping them to evolve spiritually and move forward. It shows people all aspects of that which we have to think about. Journalism is some type of self-expression, and by expressing his ideas, a journalist illuminates life changes, over time. A journalist, as a modern educator, brings into our lives novelty and food for thought, so this is a profession where I would like to work.\r\n\r\nAUCA provides a lot of different opportunities: perfect knowledge of foreign languages, the ability to make your own schedule at your convenience, and chose subjects which you are interested in. There are prospects for further education and a career abroad. The diverse student cohort at AUCA offers the chance to become acquainted with people of different nationalities, their cultures, traditions, and mentality.\r\n\r\nAUCA gives another opportunity; it gives a loan through KIVA, which is a great opportunity for all the students to cover their tuition fees. So, taking an opportunity I am also applying for a KIVA loan, which will help me to cover my tuition.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1440222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is the student of the American University of Central Asia and here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was graduating from the Kyrgyz-Turkish High School, at the end of the year, I got offers from many universities. I got good scores and enrolled in many Universities in Turkey, Malaysia, Europe, but due to financial restrictions I chose Pamukkale University in Turkey for a full scholarship. After four months of studies at the department of Management and Marketing, I had to come back to my home country due to some family reasons. My knowledge, leadership and communication skills are the most important values for being a successful businessman. The BA department at AUCA caught my attention more than other departments. I believe that the business trend in AUCA is based on knowledge and not corruption, which is very important for me. AUCA offers lots of possibilities for realizing my business ideas, organizing various projects, etc. I want to take an active part in the social life of AUCA, take the initiative and direction for me to acquire the knowledge that I am going to use in the implementation of my future projects and business ideas. In our country, even abroad, the majority of graduates of BA programs of AUCA work in good positions that help to keep the BA program one of the most promising areas. Once I finish this program, I see myself as a successful businessman and plan to open my own business centers, as well as launch a number of projects that will help to stabilize the economy of our country.\r\n\r\nThe only problem that I have is financial difficulties of my family. For this reason, I am taking an opportunity and applying for a Kiva loan, which will help me to cover my tuition fees.

is a student of AUCA, department of Business Administration, and below is her story. \r\n\r\n\u201cI am entering the most crucial phase in my life; a phase when I need to make significant academic decisions that will have a bearing on my future life and career. My keen interest in the world of business and the way in which companies operate has led me to my intention to pursue my bachelor degree in Business Administration. I believe that Business Administration is the key to successful career development in modern society. It is a subject which particularly interests me, because of its relevance to current economic issues and the potential it provides for employment in many areas. \r\nI have maintained a consistency excellent academic record that showcases my suitability for further study. Furthermore, my involvement in all classroom activities underlines my interest in expanding my knowledge. When I was in tenth grade I became a president of my high school. Being in this position helped me to gain leadership skills and improved my team-work as I always had to plan events and activities for the people in my school. While considering what career to choose, I was in the process of organizing good-bye-party for graduates. It was here that I began to draw parallels with my organizational skills and the world of Business Administration. Looking back at the holidays I organized, I believe the principles of Business Administration were at the very heart of my actions \u2013 effective communication, critical thinking, financial management and human resources. \r\n\r\nMy plans for the future include an extended academic relationship with American University of Central Asia, culminating in a Bachelor Degree in Business Administration. Then, I plan to go on to work in a successful, environmentally friendly company, strengthening it with my creative ideas, fostering innovative collaboration. I envision my work as contributing to positive, sustainable social change. I am especially passionate about the need to protect what is left of our pristine environments, and nurture or rebuild what has been destroyed. \r\n\r\nTo make all the above mentioned happen, I need a Kiva loan, and it is great that the American University of Central Asia gives its students such an

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, and here is her story.\r\n\r\nChoosing a university is very important, and maybe even the main step that can influence your life and future. It is as important as a choice of profession. So in order to love your future job, you must not make a mistake, not only with the choice of profession but also with a choice of a proper university. I had a very big desire to study at AUCA and I am happy that my dream came true. AUCA will help me to get the best education, new opportunities and a bright future.\r\n\r\nNowadays education is the main tool to attain all your aims and become a successful person. If in the past the strongest person was one who had a powerful weapon, now it is brains and an acquired education. I think that AUCA has all the resources to give opportunities to students who try to get higher knowledge. One of the most important factors is the professional teaching staff which consists of experienced objective Kyrgyz and foreign professors who give significant knowledge and teach students both theoretically and practically. \r\n\r\nAUCA is a place with new opportunities and new people for me. I can get acquainted with more people and thus, have more possibilities to share my feelings, opinions and just spend a good time with them. Fortunately, this year I had a chance to be a dance instructor for AUCA students in one important event and I found many friends there. I know that because of the American system of education I have an opportunity to choose different subjects and study with different students on each course. When I enter the building of AUCA, I immediately feel an absolutely diverse and very pleasant atmosphere, like I am in another world. Besides, in this university I will have different opportunities, since AUCA provides students with different internships, projects, student programs, clubs and extracurricular activities. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my family is unable to cover the tuition fees fully. Therefore I am applying for a Kiva loan. Kiva loans are one of great opportunities that AUCA gives to each

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of European Studies, and here is her story:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very important for a person to choose the right university and profession, that will influence their future life as a whole. If you manage to make the right choice, you will be a successful person. AUCA is one of the best universities in central Asia. I am happy to become part of it, and I think I meet all the requirements. \r\n\r\nAt first, studying at AUCA will contribute to realizing my goals. The second one, my faculty is opening for me all the doors to international organizations. And the last one, AUCA has influenced me and my life in some way.\r\n \r\nFirstly, I have plenty of goals, and I think the American University of Central Asia can help me to realize them. Studying at this university, I will improve my knowledge, confidence, resoluteness, etc. So I can say that there, I will have more opportunities to develop the best personal qualities and features to do everything to reach my goals.\r\n \r\nSecondly, I have chosen the European Studies faculty, because it is one of the best and strongest faculties in AUCA. I think that the teaching staff and friendly atmosphere at this university will give me advantages to make my life better, improve my academic skills, gain new knowledge, feel a multinational environment, and make a lot of friends from different countries. \r\n\r\nVery smart and pretty people will study in my faculty, so I can compete with them and improve my skills and knowledge to the best. As a result, I will have a lot of opportunities in my future career. I will be able to work and cooperate with the most prestigious organizations and companies that offer interesting jobs and high salaries. I think it is a good chance for me.\r\n \r\nAnother opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is Kiva loans. It is what can make dreams come true. \r\nI am applying for the loan as well, as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\u201d

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of Business Administration and here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cI have chosen to apply to AUCA because it brings innovative ways of education to people that are seeking knowledge.  One of the main things I do really enjoy is that no person is forced to make a decision on his career and life during the entrance to the university.  Personally I was in the middle of cross roads deciding whether to pursue a career in the field of business or engineering.  I was always fond of working in a team, being a leader who inspires everyone and also taking advantage in learning from experiences of others.  I believe both engineering and business are successful when a person can cooperate with others and bring in new different ideas to the table.\r\n\r\nKyrgyzstan is a perfect place for new developing small business because of its location, nature and costs of living compared to other places in the world.  It would be mutually beneficial for Kyrgyzstan and small businesses to help the business grow and expand out to CIS and later on go global.  As a result, the whole world would discover Kyrgyzstan for themselves and if they decide to visit us, they would fall in love with our country from the first visit.  I believe that will help our country achieve and maintain politically stable situation and increase political and economic awareness among people. \r\n\r\nI want to pursue my bachelor degree at the American University of Central Asia, because I think it would be the ideal place for me to understand myself,  and gain invaluable knowledge and experience to further help my country develop.  Hopefully, the AUCA community will help me to build up and shape myself. \r\n\r\nI also want to mention that AUCA gives great opportunities, which is financial aid. I would like to apply for a Kiva loan, which is available for every student of AUCA.\u201d

is 41 years old and a married woman and mother of five children; one of her children is shown in the photo with her. She has been running a business of animal sales and purchase with her husband (who is also shown in the picture) for the past 25 years. She basically belongs to a rural family where the people normally depend on agriculture and animal purchase and sales business. \r\n\r\nZarina buys animals (baby goats and baby cows) at low prices, brings them up, then her husband sells them in the market at higher prices.

The family has income from its farming activities as well. Specifically, they have hens and sell eggs from their house. The family income is modest and they get social assistance from the government because they live under the poverty line. Given her situation, Irma lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience. The start up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Irma to get a loan of 2,000 GEL and start a retail business. She will purchase stock of merchandise, such as groceries.

","en":"Currently, Boymurod is actively working in animal husbandry. Regardless of the time and situation, he never leaves his animals and tries to constantly visit the barnyard. It has become a habit for him to rise early every day to feed and water the livestock. Boymurod tries to ensure that his animals are always well-fed and feel comfortable.

One can always see a great difference between one's first and last pieces of work, and this brings to mind the time when, having little experience in knitting silver, a friend of mine bought a pair of earrings I had made.

Thanks to their hard work in the business, the couple were able to buy the store that they rented previously.

His wife works as assistant cook in a restaurant. Their children go to high school. He is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 Mongolian tugriks (MNT) to buy building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, fiberglass and foam.

This manner of working allows him to generate an income to upkeep as much as possible the new home in which they recently started to live.\n\nWhen asked what it is he likes about Pro Mujer, he responds that he likes the meetings, the training they receive in the loan and health, and the advice given."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1559.3,"image":{"id":1445915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy fabric to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T07:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T07:40:01Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Exaltaci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vivtor Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helen Lidia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxi Lucia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Carmi\u00f1a\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16576,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2651.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2723.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2797.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2872.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2933.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":376.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":405.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":424.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":759.88,"local_amount":5248.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5250.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153760,"comment":null},{"amount":394.36,"local_amount":2723.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2724.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615336,"comment":null},{"amount":405.06,"local_amount":2797.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2798.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736276,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-11T09:00:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618907,"name":"Akuvi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un m\u00e9canicien auto et \u00e2g\u00e9e de 39ans, madame Akuvi pour aider son conjoint revend des charbons de bois et des c\u00e9r\u00e9ales \u00e0 domicile.

In 2004, she started her own business of selling fruits and vegetables at the central market in the city where she lives. She started this business with initial start-up capital in the amount of 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work she put into her business, Kiyal has been able to increase her sales turnover and develop her business.

Gulnara has higher education and works in the village administration as a social worker. As an additional income for the family, Gulnara works with livestock breeding, after having started 8 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows, two horses, two goats and four sheep. The monthly income is 12,000 som (KGS). \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of calves to increase the number of heads of cattle. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of household animals, and also plans to save up money for the future education of her children."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1446868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Noot village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-11T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-10T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2015-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1027.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":719.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1027.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618927,"name":"Salama Ii Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Evariste  fait partie du groupe Salama II  et  habite \u00e0  Bubanza.
