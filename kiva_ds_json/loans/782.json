Some time ago, she decided to set up her own sewing workshop so that she didn't have to answer to a boss.\r\n\r\nMaria Virgelina currently works making household furnishings such as bedclothes, bedspreads, drapes, etc.  Thanks to this work, she makes the income she needs to support her household.\r\n\r\nMaria Virgelina has recently had very good orders from her customers but she has realized that her orders don't increase because she doesn't have physical products to display.  This is because she has always made her products to her customers' requirements.  However, now her customers like her to show them designs and then make an order with her for certain quantities.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maria Virgelina needs to buy some supplies such as fabric, thread, needles and other products which she uses in her sewing.  Right now, she doesn't have the capital she needs to buy this merchandise.  For this reason, she hopes to receive a loan which will allow her to buy the supplies she needs.\r\n\r\nMaria Virgelina's dream is for her sales to increase considerably so that she can create a lot of work for the people who need it most.

Se levanta a las 3:30 a.m.  Para prepararse e irse al lugar donde elabora el pan, por la tarde se va en una motocicleta a vender el pan por diferentes cantones y caser\u00edos. Los materiales para elaborar el pan los compra en una ciudad del oriente del pa\u00eds y tarda unos treinta minutos en llegar ah\u00ed. \n\nHoy en d\u00eda Edgar quiere instalar su propia panader\u00eda, por lo que solicita el pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, para comprar 400 ladrillos, 6 bolsas de cemento y para pago de mano de obra, ya que construir\u00e1 un horno artesanal de barro para coser el pan, porque el horno de gas es muy caro.

He rises at 3:30am to get ready and head out to the place where he makes the bread.  In the afternoon he heads out on a motorcycle to sell the bread in various cantons and settlements.  He buys the ingredients for the bread in a city in the east of the country and takes about thirty minutes to get there.\r\n\r\nToday, Edgar wants to set up his own bakery which is why he\u2019s asked Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy 400 bricks, 6 sacks of cement and to pay labor costs to build an artisanal clay oven to bake the bread because gas ovens are very expensive.  This way he will have his own business and will be able to receive better income for his family and provide schooling for his son.  He intends to hire four bakers and about ten salesmen once his bakery is operational.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":991724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy 400

un d\u00eda tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de independizarse debido a que el trabajo era muy mal pago y no le alcanzaba para generar los ingresos suficientes para el sostenimiento de su familia.\nHenry inici\u00f3 su negocio de venta de calzado con un capital muy bajo, pero gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos que le han otorgado ha podido ir mejorando su negocio, surti\u00e9ndolo con mayor variedad de productos y atrayendo as\u00ed una mayor clientela. Henry desde entonces ha podido mejorar su empresa considerablemente y actualmente tiene m\u00e1s clientes que los que puede atender.\nEs por esto que Henry en el momento busca comprar m\u00e1s surtido de calzado, pero no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar la compra de esta mercanc\u00eda, por lo que tiene la esperanza puesta en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de mercanc\u00eda de calzado para surtir su almac\u00e9n y tener una mayor cantidad para ofrecer a sus clientes.\nHenry espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender a m\u00e1s clientes que antes no pod\u00eda atender.\nHenry tiene el sue\u00f1o de que su negocio le genere grandes ingresos de modo que pueda brindarles en un futuro una mejor educaci\u00f3n, y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"Henry is person known by his family and neighbors as being very hardworking and devoted to his family\u2019s and other people\u2019s wellbeing.  He\u2019s 40 years old, married and the father of two children who are 2 and 9 years old and who are his motivation to work hard every day.\r\n\r\nHenry used to work as an employee in a firm but one day made the decision to go into business for himself because the job didn\u2019t pay very well and he didn\u2019t earn enough income to support his family.  Henry started his shoe selling business with very little capital but thanks to the loans he\u2019s been granted he\u2019s been able to improve his business stocking it with a wider variety of products and attracting a larger clientele.  Since then, Henry has been able to improve his firm considerably and he currently has more customers than he can tend to.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, henry wants to buy a still wider selection of shoes but lacks sufficient capital to buy this merchandise so he\u2019s placed his hope on a loan that will allow him to buy merchandise to stock his shoe store and have larger amounts to offer his customers.\r\n\r\nHenry hopes that his income will increase considerably this way because he will be able to take care of more customers than he\u2019s been able to to date.

Besides, she has a large pending order from one of her customers to supply uniforms for their firm.  Because of this, Mar\u00eda Olga needs to buy supplies and repair her sewing machine.  However, she does not have sufficient capital at present to do so which is why she\u2019s hoping for a loan that will allow her to buy the supplies needed to make the uniforms like fabric and thread, among others, and to repair her sewing machine so that she can continue with her work normally.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Olga\u2019s dream is that her children can attend University and this is why she saves up all she\u2019s able to in order to have sufficient resources when that moment arrives.

Martha, siempre ha querido brindarles la mejor calidad de vida a sus hijos, es por esto que le colabora a su esposo en la generaci\u00f3n de ingresos para el hogar. \nDebido a las pocas oportunidades de empleo que se le presentaban, Martha decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio de comidas r\u00e1pidas, el cual ha sido el generador de los ingresos para que ella le pueda colaborar a su esposo en los ingresos del hogar.\nMartha, generalmente ha tenido muy buenas ventas, sin embargo, en diciembre debido a la temporada invernal que se vio, sus ventas disminuyeron significativamente, por lo que actualmente no cuenta con mucho dinero disponible. A pesar de que el panorama se le ha venido aclarando a Martha, pues sus ventas han aumentado en el mes de Enero considerablemente, a\u00fan cuenta con muy poco dinero disponible para comprar los insumos necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de las comidas r\u00e1pidas para la venta a sus clientes. Es por esto que Martha aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de insumos como salsas, panes, carnes, entre otros para la elaboraci\u00f3n de comidas r\u00e1pidas. \n\nMartha espera que sus ventas sigan aumentando como lo han hecho en el mes de Enero y poder as\u00ed seguir generando ingresos suficientes para mejorar la calidad de vida de todas las personas de su hogar.\nMartha, tiene el sue\u00f1o de que su negocio crezca, y en un futuro, le brinde la posibilidad de ofrecerles a sus hijos un acceso a la educaci\u00f3n universitaria y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica en sus vidas.\n","en":"Martha has always been noted for being a very hardworking person who is devoted to her family.  She\u2019s 54 years old, married and the mother of two children who are 15 and 17 years old.  Martha has always wanted to provide a better quality of life for her children and this is why she collaborates with her husband generating income for the home.\r\n\r\nBecause of the few employment opportunities she had, Martha decided to open her own fast food business which has generated income that she can use to share household expenses with her husband.  Martha\u2019s sales are generally very good.  However, because of the winter conditions in December, sales dropped considerably so she doesn\u2019t have much money available presently.  Even though Martha\u2019s outlook has been improving since January sales have improved considerably, she still has very little disposable money to buy the necessary ingredients to make the fast food to sell to her customers.  This is why Martha hopes for a loan that will give her the opportunity to buy ingredients like sauces, bread, and meat, among others, to make her fast food.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes that her sales will continue to increase like they\u2019ve done in the month of January so that she can continue generating sufficient income to improve the quality of life for everyone in her home.  Martha\u2019s dream is that the business grows and in the future to provide her children with access to a university education and economic stability in their life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":991730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

siempre hab\u00eda querido colaborar con los gastos del hogar a su esposo, pues con lo que el ganaba en su empleo, no era suficiente para poder satisfacer plenamente todas las necesidades de su hogar. \nMaricela, con 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 2 hijos de 6 y 12 a\u00f1os, a los cuales siempre les ha querido brindar la mejor educaci\u00f3n posible. \nEs por esto que Maricela, luego de haber trabajado en un taller de confecci\u00f3n durante mucho tiempo, decidi\u00f3 retirarse y empezar a trabajar como independiente, por lo que mont\u00f3 una sala de internet. \nMaricela desde entonces trabaja en su sala de internet todos los d\u00edas para generar ingresos suficientes para aportar a los gastos de su hogar.\nMaricela actualmente tiene muy buena clientela, y gracias al buen servicio que ella ofrece a\u00fan sigue aumentando la visita de sus clientes. Sin embargo, Maricela no cuenta con el servicio de impresi\u00f3n y scanner, servicio que sus clientes le han pedido durante mucho tiempo, pues no cuenta con el capital suficiente para ello. Es por esto que Maricela quiere comprar una fotocopiadora que sea multiusos y tambi\u00e9n le permita ofrecer el servicio de scanner a sus clientes. Pero como Maricela no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar esta compra, tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le permitir\u00e1 acceder a la compra de una impresora multiusos que le permita imprimir, fotocopiar y scannear, de modo que sus clientes encuentren en su caf\u00e9 internet todas las necesidades satisfechas.\n\nMaricela espera que de esta manera sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, y as\u00ed pueda ofrecerles a su esposo y sus 2 hijos una mejor calidad de vida.\nMaricela tiene el sue\u00f1o de que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad, y en un futuro acceder a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria que les permita prepararse para un empleo bien remunerado.\n","en":"Maricela has always wanted to help her husband pay for home expenses, because what he used to earn at his job wasn't enough to fulfill all of their needs.\r\n33-year-old Maricela has two children aged 6 and 12, and she has always wanted to provide the best possible education for them. That's the reason why, after having worked at a dressmaking shop for a long time, Maricela decided to retire and start working independently by setting up an internet caf\u00e9.\r\nEver since then, Maricela has worked at her cybercaf\u00e9 everyday in order to get enough profits to contribute to her home expenses. Maricela currently has very good clientele and, thanks to the good service she provides, her customer's visits are still increasing. However, Maricela doesn't dispose of a printing and scanning service, which her customers have long been asking for, because she lacks the working capital for it. That is why Maricela wants to purchase a multifunction copier which also allows her to offer scanning services to her customers. But, since Maricela doesn't have enough capital to make that purchase, she hopes the loan will allow her to purchase a multifunction copier for printing, photocopying and scanning, so that her customers can have all of their needs met at her internet caf\u00e9.\r\nMaricela hopes that by doing that, her sales will considerably increase, and she will be able to improve her husband's and her two children's living conditions.\r\nMaricela dreams of having her children get a high quality education, and in the future get a college education so that they can prepare themselves for a well-paying job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":991777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

She's 63 years old and lives in the town of Granada. She has two children who are already independent. She attended a nuns' school in Chinandega in order to study for a career in nursing. Soon she was sent to the town of Granada to practice her profession. There she got a permanent job as a nurse at a hospital, got settled, married and raised her children, but then she retired. She currently provides nursing services privately from her home. She is very well-known in her neighborhood, because of how experienced and friendly she is.

She is married and the mother of three children. She started her business because of her mother, the former owner of the grocery store. She gradually learned every chore her mother did on a daily basis in the grocery store until she took charge completely and became independent from her mother. She introduced new products little by little in order to provide more variety and diversity at the store, so it will keep running and allow her to pay for her children's education. Her husband works as a tailor while she manages the business as well as their home.\r\nShe got the loan in order to purchase basic grains, cleaning products, olive oil, juices, canned goods, milk, eggs and school supplies. She still has plans to improve the store, get more merchandise, purchase shelves and window displays and save money for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":991827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase basic grains, cleaning products, olive oil, juices, canned goods, milk, eggs and school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":260.51,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":86.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263382053,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":86.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095581,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":86.84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710194,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-03T00:22:54Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386742,"name":"Niuvai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Niuvai is 39 years old, married and has four children.

Es por esto que entonces decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio de comidas el cual le generara mayores ingresos para el sostenimiento del hogar.\nAleida inici\u00f3 su negocio de comidas fritas, como papas, empanadas, entre otros, hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os, y desde entonces ha venido ejerciendo esta actividad como m\u00e9todo de generaci\u00f3n de ingresos. Aleida, tuvo un tiempo en el cual no pudo trabajar mucho, puesto que su esposo se encontraba enfermo y necesitaba cuidarlo. Por esto, su negocio hoy se encuentra con niveles muy bajos de ventas, apenas esta recuperando la clientela y espera poder iniciar de nuevo.\nEs por esto que Aleida espera comprar insumos para preparar sus comidas fritas, adem\u00e1s de unas vitrinas para exhibir su comida. Sin embargo, no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar estas compras, por lo que tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brindar\u00e1 la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de los insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas fritas como empanadas, papas, entre otros, y la compra de unas vitrinas de exhibici\u00f3n que le permitan tener a la vista de sus clientes los productos que ofrece.\n\nAleida espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, y pueda as\u00ed ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida a las personas de su hogar. \nAdem\u00e1s, Aleida sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos tengan la oportunidad de acceder a una educaci\u00f3n superior.\nAleida tambi\u00e9n se ha impuesto una meta y es que pueda comprar o construir apartamentitos para arrendarlos y vivir el arriendo de estos.\n","en":"Hardworking and dedicated to her family are the words that would best describe Aleida, a person who has always been on the lookout for income generating opportunities and has always wanted her family to have the best possible quality of life. \r\nAleida is 42 years old, she is married and the mother of three children, who are her motivation to work hard every day. \r\nAleida used to work for different companies and she did different jobs, but she did not like the idea of having to work for such low wages.  This led her to decide to start her own food business, which generated a better income with which to sustain her family.\r\nShe started her fried food business, selling French fries and pasties, among others, approximately five years ago, and since then this activity has been her source of income. Aleida went through a period during which she could not work very much because her husband was ill and she needed to look after him. Because of that, her sales are very low at the moment. She is only now recovering her clientele and hoping to get started once again.\r\nFor this reason, she is hoping to buy ingredients for her fried foods and some display counters to exhibit them. However, she does not have the necessary capital to make these purchases, so she hopes a loan will allow her to buy the ingredients to prepare her French fries and pasties, among other fried foods, and the display counters that will allow her customers to see what she has to offer. \r\nShe hopes her income will increase considerably in this way and she will be able to offer a better standard of living to her family members. \r\nAleida also hopes that her children will be able to access a college education.\r\nShe has set herself a goal: to buy or build small apartments that she can rent out

She took orders from her customers and now she sells gold and silver in different designs. After she separated from her husband, her children never left her alone and have always supported her business. Only one daughter currently lives with her and helps her financially, because she's working.

Formerly when she lived with her husband their income was not sufficient enough to provide a good quality of life. Now, her husband has abandoned her and she is a single mother head of household with a son. She wants to give him all that he needs. Since being abandoned, Gladis has been casting about for ways to make a living. \r\n\r\nCurrently she gives manicures to people in her area. She learned by watching the person who did her nails and then began giving manicures to family members and little by little started attracting new customers until she reached the point where today she has a large client base.

This loan will create better living conditions for the family. Saqer is photographed in the picture.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

un nuevo empresario en la actividad que tanto le ha gustado.\nJorge Ivan, con 43 a\u00f1os de edad, casado y padre de 2 hijos, trabaj\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 12 a\u00f1os en un gimnasio de la ciudad, donde laboraba como la persona encargada del montaje y el mantenimiento de los equipos. Jorge Ivan no le gust\u00f3 seguir adelante con ese empleo debido a que era muy mal pago.\nJorge Ivan decidi\u00f3 tomar al camino de independizarse, y mont\u00f3 su propio taller de m\u00e1quinas para gimnasio, donde fabrica las m\u00e1quinas y tambi\u00e9n le hace mantenimiento a las m\u00e1quinas de varios gimnasios de la ciudad. Gracias a esto, Jorge Iv\u00e1n genera los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar.\nJorge Iv\u00e1n actualmente tiene un contrato para entregar unas m\u00e1quinas de gimnasio con un muy buen cliente suyo, y requiere de m\u00e1s materia prima para culminar la elaboraci\u00f3n de este y otras m\u00e1quinas m\u00e1s. Sin embargo, no cuenta con suficiente dinero puesto que su cliente le paga una vez entregada la m\u00e1quina, es por esto que Jorge Ivan tiene la esperanza puesta en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brindar\u00e1 la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de materias primas como hierro, metal, entre otros, para la elaboraci\u00f3n de las m\u00e1quinas para el gimnasio.\nJorge Ivan sue\u00f1a con que su negocio crezca y se consolide como un referente en la regi\u00f3n, de modo que pueda generar empleo para las dem\u00e1s personas que m\u00e1s lo necesitan y tambi\u00e9n genere suficientes ingresos para progresar con su familia.\nJorge Ivan sue\u00f1a brind\u00e1ndole a su esposa una mejor calidad de vida, y a sus 2 hijos el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad. Jorge Ivan sue\u00f1a con que su familia en un futuro tenga una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica que les permita evitar pasar por situaciones adversas como las que ha tenido que pasar el en la vida.\n","en":"Enterprising is the best way to describe Jorge Ivan, someone who, thanks to his charisma and desire to get ahead, has progressed as a businessman, doing the job that he likes the most.\r\n\r\nJorge Ivan is 43 years old, he is married and is a father to 2 children. He worked in a city gymnasium for more than 12 years, as the person responsible for setting up and maintaining the equipment. Jorge Ivan did not want to continue doing this job due to the poor pay. He decided to go down the road of independence and he set up his own workshop for gymnasium equipment, where he manufactures and performs maintenance for several gymnasiums in the city. This provides Jorge Ivan with the necessary income to maintain his household.\r\n\r\nJorge Ivan currently has a contract to deliver some gymnasium machines to a very good customer of his and he needs more raw material to complete the production of this and other machines. However, he does have enough money due to the fact that his customer will pay him once the machine is delivered.

Sin embargo, Marta Cecilia no cuenta con el dinero suficiente en estos momentos, por lo que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina de coser que le permita tener una persona como empleada trabajando al lado suyo.\n\nMarta Cecilia espera que sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente debido a que podr\u00e1 recibir m\u00e1s trabajo por parte de la empresa, y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida a su esposo y sus 2 hijos.

Therefore, when she grew up it was hard for her to find a job.  Thanks to a course that she was given, she learned how to make clothes.  Later, thanks to a very good boss that she had, she worked as a sewing machine operator in a business.  \r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia, age 64, is currently married and has two children.  She has always wanted to give them everything that they need.\r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia\u2019s boss offered her the chance to have a machine in her house.  This would allow her to work from home.  Therefore, Marta Cecilia now receives cut fabrics, and she sews them into garments.  Marta Cecilia is very behind in her production because she only has her one sewing machine.\r\n\r\nThat is why she wants to buy a sewing machine to generate a job and to have a person to help her with her work.  However, Marta Cecilia does not have enough money at this time.  This is why Marta hopes for a loan that will give her the opportunity to buy a sewing machine that will allow her to have an employee working at her side.\r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia hopes that her sales increase considerably because she will be able to get more work from the company.  This way she will be able to give her husband and her two children a better quality of life.

Siempre le ha gustado y es por esto que despu\u00e9s inici\u00f3 un curso donde le ense\u00f1aron m\u00e1s acerca de las t\u00e9cnicas de confecci\u00f3n. Una vez aprendi\u00f3 todas las t\u00e9cnicas y aprendi\u00f3 a producir prendas de vestir, su padre le regal\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina para iniciar su trabajo, y estas m\u00e1quinas las ha ido renovando con el pasar del tiempo. \n\nActualmente Luz Elena sigue con su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n y ya compr\u00f3 dos m\u00e1quinas m\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s de una mesa de corte y otras herramientas m\u00e1s para su taller. Gracias a la buena calidad de los productos que confecciona, Luz Elena tiene muy buena reputaci\u00f3n entre sus clientes, los cuales le hacen muy buenos pedidos. A menudo, Luz Elena tiene que contratar a 2 personas para que le ayuden con su trabajo, pues los pedidos son tan grandes que no le da para confeccionarlos ella sola. \n\nLuz Elena ha visto como sus ventas se han incrementado significativamente, y ya no la manera de confeccionarlos a m\u00e1quina y a mano no le esta dando resultados. Es por esto que Luz Elena acude a la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina de confecci\u00f3n industrial, con la cual pueda realizar su confecci\u00f3n de manera automatizada y produzca de manera m\u00e1s eficiente. \n\nLuz Elena sue\u00f1a con que su negocio siga creciendo y le genere buenas ganancias con las cuales pueda brindarles a su esposo y a sus 2 hijos de 14 y 18 a\u00f1os, una mejor calidad de vida y una prosperidad econ\u00f3mica y estable.\n","en":"Luz Elena has dedicated the greater part of her life to sewing since her mother taught her this business from a very early age. She has always enjoyed it and so later she decided to begin a course of study where she was taught more about the techniques of dressmaking. Once she learned all the techniques and learned to make articles of clothing, her father gifted her a sewing machine with which to begin her work, and she has been refurbishing these machines as time goes by. \r\n\r\nCurrently Luz Elena remains in business with her own dressmaking shop and has already purchased two additional machines, as well as a cutting table and other tools for her shop. Thanks to the good quality of the apparel she makes, Luz Elena has a very good reputation among her customers, who place very good orders with her. Frequently Luz Elena must hire two persons to help her with her work, since the orders are so large that she is not able to fulfill them all on her own. \r\n\r\nLuz Elena has seen her sales increase substantially, and making the clothes by machine and by hand is no longer producing results.  Thus Luz Elena turns to the hope that a loan may provide her with the possibility of being able to purchase an industrial sewing machine with which to construct the apparel in automated, and thus more efficient, fashion. \r\n\r\nLuz Elena dreams that her business would continue to grow and generate a good profit with which to offer her husband and two children, of 14 and 18 years of age, a better quality of life and stable financial prosperity.

He has worked as a security guard for a business for two years, and he is very good at his job. Before getting this job, he worked in agriculture; this is the job his father taught him.\r\nHe still cultivates food, but only for his family's consumption. He buys supplies such as fertilizer and pesticides in a city in the east of the country. In order to get there, he has to walk two and a half kilometers to catch the bus. Coming back, he has to carry everything with him and walk back home.\r\nLidio is requesting this loan for the purchase of cement, sand, and iron, and to pay labourers to build a hallway in his home; the current one is damaged. This way, his family will be more secure; the hallway is dangerous. The earthquakes have damaged the supporting beam, and Lidio doesn't have the money to repair it. In the future he wants to make other repairs to his home; for example, to put in a floor. He wants to provide his family with a dignified and secure

Damaris se dedica desde hace aproximadamente 9 a\u00f1os a la venta de productos de uso personal, gracias a que su abuela le ense\u00f1o muy bien.

Damaris cuenta con muy bajo capital para comprar los pedidos por lo que debe dejar de vender a grandes cantidades. Debido a que actualmente tiene un gran pedido de un cliente que no quiere pasar por alto, Damaris tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brindar\u00e1 la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de productos de uso personal como son lociones, maquillaje, cremas, entre otros, y poder as\u00ed cumplir con el pedido a su cliente y seguir generando m\u00e1s ingresos para su hogar.\n\nDamaris sue\u00f1a con no tener que vender por pocas cantidades, sino hacerse a un gran capital que le permita tener una gran distribuidora, y contratar a muchas personas que requieran de unos ingresos.

At 39 years old, she is a single mother, head of her  family with a 6 year old son, who she is looking to provide with everything he needs. Damaris has worked for approximately 9 years selling personal care products, thanks to her grandmother who taught her well. Damaris currently has very good clients, and thanks to this she can affort the expenses of her home and can offer her son an education and stable life.\r\n\r\nDamaris has increased her sales thanks to the quality of her products, to the extent that she has had to pass up sales from some orders as a result of not having the capacity to respond to the request. Damaris has very low capital to buy the orders, which she would like to be able to sell in large quantities. Given that she currently has a large order from a client that she does not want to pass up, Damaris hopes that this loan will provide her the opportunity to make the purchase of personal care products such as lotions, makeup, and creams among others, and she can thereby complete her client's order and generate more income for her home. \r\n\r\nDamaris dreams of not having to sell in small quantities, rather she would like to get access to more capital that would allow her to have a larger distributor and hire many people who require income.

Nancy is a single mother and head of a family with 2 children, 16 and 13 years old, whose father abandoned them a long time ago. Nancy should generate enough income to support the expenses of her home and provide an education for her two children. Additionally, Nancy wants to provide the possibility of accessing education to her young niece, who doesn't have this possibility given her father abandoned her and her mom, Nancy's sister, finds herself unemployed. \r\n\r\nNancy learned to sew from her family as a young girl and she decided to open her own sewing workship where she offers sewing services to third parties. In this shop Nancy has very good sales, but has the inconvenience that the roof of the sewing workshiop is crumbling because it is made of wood and has a large leak. Nancy needs to urgently repair the roof, as she has been unable to use the shop due to fear that the roof will fall on her. Nancy, given that she doesn't have the money to perform the roof repair, hopes that this loan will allow her to repair the roof so it doesn't fall and she can continue working in her shop normally. \r\n\r\nNancy dreams that her sewing workship continues increaseing its sales, and that in this way she can generate employment for her family and other people who can't find employment opporutunities.

Prior to this, Felix had a bakery, but he decided to other things that would help him to improve his income.\r\n\r\nHe bought the pigs when they were 5 weeks old, in a city that is two hours away from where lives. He bought the concentrate, food and vitamins in the same place and he sells the meat in a city that is two hours away from his house. He has strong clientel and he supplies the city's sellers with meat. \r\n\r\nFelix asks for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy sheet metal, cement, sand, iron and bricks to construct another pigsty. This way he will be able to raise more pigs so that when they are young he can keep them in one pigsty and when they are at the stage to be butchered he can transfer them to another. As the pigs keep growing he will categorize them by pigsty. With this investment his production will be greater and he will recieve better income.

Gerardo is 36, married, and has two children. He tells us he has done paint and body work for ten years. He is applying for this loan because the work he has requires the purchase of a lot of materials, so he wants to buy paint, wiping cloths, acrylic etc., to have ready for the cars.\r\n\r\nThere is also Hilario. He tells us that he has been a mechanic for ten years and has been the owner of a home-based auto body and repair shop for four years. He is applying for this loan because he needs to buy tools and materials for his work. \r\n\r\nThis is because there are people who come to leave their cars, and don't give him any advance notice, so he has to buy everything he needs, whether replacement car parts, or paint for doing body work. \r\n\r\nIn other cases, people don't pay him until the work is done; and this is when sometimes he doesn't have what he needs, so he's late finishing the jobs, because of the money that he has to invest in them. So he needs to stockpile gaskets, silicones, wiping cloths, tools, paint etc. Also, he tells us that he wants to buy a spray gun for painting cars. \r\n\r\nHe is confident that FAPE can offer him the support he needs, as he is the leader of the duo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":979266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

Con el \u00e1nimo de revertir esta situaci\u00f3n, Nubia quiere comprar una carpa para taparse, por lo que acude a un pr\u00e9stamo con la esperanza de que este le pueda brindar la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de una carpa para taparse de la lluvia y la compra de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas.\n\nNubia espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues en \u00e9pocas de lluvias sus ventas no se ver\u00e1n tan afectadas.\nNubia sue\u00f1a con que en un futuro su negocio le permita brindarles a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria, adem\u00e1s, de poder mejorar la calidad de vida de su esposo, sus hijos y ella.\n","en":"Nubia is a very hard-working person and always wants to provide the best quality of life to her husband and two children.  Due to the limited employment opportunities available to her husband, and the little income he was bringing home for this reason, Nubia decided to set up a fast food business outside of one of the city's universities.  Since then, Nubia has contributed to the household income, collaborating with her husband on expenses incurred.\r\n\r\nNubia has many good clients, which has caused her income to increase considerably.  Nonetheless, the winter has brought down sales because she doesn't have a tent for cover, only a plastic sheet that keeps out a little of the rain.  In an effort to reverse this situation, Nubia is turning to a loan in the hope that it will provide an opportunity to purchase a tent for protection from rain as well as to buy supplies for preparation of meals. Nubia hopes that this will result in a considerable increase in income, since sales won't be so affected by the rainy season.\r\n\r\nNubia dreams that her business will allow her to offer her children a quality education and access to a university education as well as improve quality of life for her husband, her children and herself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":994760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a tent for protection from the rain and to purchase supplies for meal preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-03T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-04T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nubia Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56940},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58547},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60200},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61899},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63646},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65443},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67290},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69189},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71142},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73150},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75215},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77339}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.93,"local_amount":115435,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":116650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075609,"comment":null},{"amount":32.38,"local_amount":57566,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":58172.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902341,"comment":null},{"amount":352.69,"local_amount":626999,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":633602.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432096,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T01:49:11Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387391,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 40 year old a married woman with three children, two of whom are in school.

Approximately 22 years ago, Ruth took a class in order to paint country art, through which she learned how to do this activity. Since then, and with the thought of earning necessary income for her household, Ruth has produced her crafts and sold them to large customers she has. Currently, Ruth has so many orders that she cannot keep up with some of the orders her customers place. Thanks to this, Ruth is recognized for having very good products of very good quality. In addition to country art, Ruth makes linen goods for the home, which she also does by hand, and also sells to her customers. With the combination of the two activities, Ruth can contribute to generating the income necessary to cover the expenses of her household, which she shares with her husband and their 4 children.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ruth has a large order from a customer that requires the purchase of raw materials in order to do it. This is why Ruth hopes that a loan will give her the opportunity to purchase raw materials such as paint, fabric, and various materials that she needs to make her crafts.\r\n\r\nRuth hopes that her sales will continue to increase, and she dreams that one day she will be able to have a large building where she can exhibit her products.

They are on average 46 years old, have 5 children each, and live in the rural commune of Sako\u00efba.\r\nThey met and are united through bonds of kinship, marriage, and are involved in the small business of selling ladles, mortars, and calabash gourds, both simple and engraved.  In order to increase their business, the members of the group have decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and have requested their 12th solidarity loan.  \r\nAminata, second woman from the right in the photo, is known for the sale of calabash gourds engraved with beautiful motifs and patterns.  She is planning to use her loan to buy 300 calabash gourds which will be engraved.  Engraving is done by dipping needles in the fire for at least an hour.  After the needles have become red, they are removed from the fire and used to make beautiful designs on the back of the gourds.  Aminata buys her raw materials at the Kati\u00e8na market.  She sells from home, in nearby villages, and at the Grand Market in S\u00e9gou, for cash or on credit, to mostly women customers.  With this loan, Aminata expects average monthly profits to reach 25,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the activity and also used to take care of household expenses and children's healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":999214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy calabash gourds.

and selling tortillas from her home for ten years. At first she sold snacks to children who passed by on their way to the local school. When she realized that there was no place selling tortillas in the surrounding area, she started one, thanks to the support she got from a girl who worked with her as a helper. \r\n\r\nShe now also sells traditional clothing in the capital city, but only on Sundays. So she is applying for this loan to buy corn at wholesale, and merchandise for her business selling traditional clothing. \r\n\r\nAs a small business owner, she got to know Maria Eugenia, who for three years has been making and selling carnitas and chicharrones (barbecued pork and pork rinds) beside Lucia's tortilla stand. \r\n\r\nEugenia has the business she runs thanks to her mother's initiative in renting a place, and in making a name for herself in her community for the rich, delicious way she makes her carnitas and chicharrones. Now they have two chicharrones stands in the capital city. \r\n\r\nLucia needs working capital to be able to invest a bit more in her tortilla and traditional clothing businesses for the Christmas and New Year's season. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Eugenia also had several meat orders for Christmas gatherings, so they are deciding to work together as loan partners and successful women.

She purchases the ingredients she needs for making pupusas and traditional dishes in the city market, which takes her about ten minutes to get to by minibus, and in some shops that are located about five kilometers from her house. \r\n\r\nYanira is asking for the loan so she can purchase 46 kg (100 lbs) of maize, six cabbages, half a box of tomatoes for making sauce, oil, seasoning, and other items.  She will also use the loan to purchase half a truckload of sand, 500 bricks, 15 bags of cement, and 230 kg (500 lbs) of rebar, which she will use to build a room in her house.\r\n\r\nThe loan will ensure that Yanira will have enough ingredients for making pupusas and other traditional dishes to meet existing demand.  It will also allow her to earn enough profits to build a room for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1102.06,"image":{"id":995298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

When he realized one day that his job was very poorly paid, he decided to become independent and launch his own business. In the beginning he distributed the goods on a motorcycle, then a few loans helped him to buy a car and he could serve more customers because he could transport a larger quantity of goods.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Juan Carlos runs his business with a very good customer base and because of this his income has increased considerably. Often he has so many customers that he can't serve them all, because his inventory is not sufficient for all his customers. This is why Juan Carlos hopes that a loan will give him the opportunity to buy more bakery goods and pastries in order to have more goods to sell to more customers and thus he would continue to earn money for his household expenses.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos dreams that his business may give him a good profit. Later on, he might launch a great selling company and offer his products in several cities and create jobs. In addition, Juan Carlos dreams that his children get a high-quality education and that he and his wife could enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":993522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"to buy more bakery goods and pastries in order to have more goods to sell to more customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-04T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-05T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71182},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73190},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75255},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77377},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79560},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81805},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86485},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88925},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91433},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":94012},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":96664}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.93,"local_amount":71182,"processed_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":74082.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362283,"comment":null},{"amount":73.06,"local_amount":127059,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":132236.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075583,"comment":null},{"amount":44.63,"local_amount":77624,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":80787.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902318,"comment":null},{"amount":43.38,"local_amount":75441,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":78515.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326686,"comment":null},{"amount":47.98,"local_amount":83447,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":86847.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432072,"comment":null},{"amount":325.02,"local_amount":565247,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":588280.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T18:14:02Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385973,"name":"Henry Nelson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Henry es una persona emprendedora que desde hace aproximadamente 7 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will use the loan as part of her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosana hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

She looks after them in her parents' house which is located in the city of Jauja. Her melancholic expression is due to the death of one of her children who passed away one month ago. She feels sad but she knows that she must continue working in order to get her other children ahead in life. Her main job is to provide a laundry service for her neighbors, who pay her according to the amount she washes. She earns some money from this but she does not always carry out this service. Therefore, in the mornings she works in a house where she cleans and cooks. There they pay her a monthly salary which allows her to financially support her home. \"I have many jobs since I support my children by myself\", she states. \r\n\r\nNow her plan is take advantage of the job that the city government is offering for the construction of a new road. She says that her children will stop receiving the orphan's pension and she wants to get a stable job. She therefore wants to set up a work tricycle to sell candy on the streets, in schools and at festivals where there is good demand. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to support group \"Sin Fronteras\" [Without Borders] and this is her third loan with MFP. Therefore she is hoping for a small loan to allow her to fulfill her objectives. Apart from that she promises to make her repayments, as she did in her previous loan.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is both family tradition and a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered wasteful to spend money on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.  Lilibeth earns a minimum of Php500 in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nLilibeth dreams of giving her child a good and high quality education through all of her hard work on her business and also hopes to have her own restaurant.

She lives with Lucio, her husband of 17 years. They have 7 children whom they raised with much love and now they live with a granddaughter in a rented house in the city of Jauja.  Now she no longer has children to raise for they are all grown up and she is proud. But she has to work, together with her husband, in order to support herself and to avoid any worries aside from raising her granddaughter.\r\n\r\nReyna plants corn, potatoes and alfalfa on their own land, which she tends constantly since at harvest she markets the food at the wholesale market in the city where she has fixed customers. In addition, her husband receives a pension after retiring from his job. Over time, he saved money to buy an auto and now works as a taxi driver in public transportation between two nearby cities. He obtained all the permits, except for one, in order to be able to work in peace. He earns a good salary from his work because he owns the auto and thus gets a better profit.\r\n\r\nReyna belongs to the San Lorenzo Communal Bank and this is their eleventh loan with MFP. Consequently she hopes for a small loan so that she can meet her goals. She promises to make her payments on time, as she did with an earlier loan she had.
