A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe. Most people in Homa Bay make their living from farming, and the rolling hills of the area are dotted with fields and fruit tree plantations.\r\n\r\nSamson is married and has seven children. He also cares for two orphans from the area. He works as a pastor, serving two gospel churches, and as a community mobilizer, organizing local groups in the area. In addition to this work, Samson also farms, and is currently growing maize, sweet potatoes, kale, sunflower, amaranth, and tomatoes, as well as rearing cows and chickens. He likes beekeeping because honey is a nutritious food, and the bees will pollinate his sunflowers, leading to higher yields and a higher income. \r\n\r\nThis is Samson\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use the income from his hives to educate his children, as well as improve his land by adding more trees for his bees to forage on.

Homa Bay County is located at the southwestern tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flows of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay County means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nDaniel is married and has seven children.

lives and works outside of Sindo, in Homa Bay County. Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nPetro is married and has nine children and many grandchildren. He has retired from his job as a union labourer, while his wife is engaged in selling cereals. He has been farming for 50 years, and is currently growing maize, millet, beans, lentils, sunflower, and amaranth, as well as raising dairy goats and local cattle. Petro thinks that beekeeping is a good business as \u201cit is not a tiresome activity.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is Petro\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to pay school fees for his grandchildren.

However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Dianna was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. The loan is a hope for this family and they will be very grateful to lenders' for

Toktokan started this 16 years ago when she bought cattle with 20,000 KGS. Because of Toktokan's hard work, today her farm boasts two dairy cows, one horse, one bull, and forty sheep. Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Toktokan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase cows for breeding.

He asks for this loan to be able to purchase forage for feeding the livestock. This will greatly help him to continue developing his farm and run it in a sustainable way. As this is Vazgen's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before because they have no credit history.\r\n\r\nVazgen waits for the lenders' support. The loan is very important for him.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He and his wife lead a happy life and are doing all they can to give a good life to their child.  Rustam makes a living from his own business and has been involved in buying and selling fruits and vegetables for a few years already.  He used to work on a mid-size farm in the past, but he then decided to sell his own harvest.  Using his own truck, he now transports his crops and sells them at the market in town.   He also buys other types of fruits and vegetables at the market and resells them in his own store.  This business brings him a stable and good income.\r\n\r\nRustam now wants to expand his business and he would also like to build a small kiosk, next to his house, where his wife could sell fruits and vegetables.  He plans to use his loan to buy a large selection of fruits and vegetables.  He has turned to Arvand to receive this loan, and he is hoping for a positive outcome.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1498350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rustam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":93.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":114.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":116.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":119.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125.22},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.61},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.37},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.22},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658088,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

The loan will be a huge support for this hard working farmer as he will be able to continue his agribusiness.\r\n\r\nArtur has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately, he wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Artur was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, Artur has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

Homa Bay County is located at the southwestern tip of Kenya, and its northern end is dominated by Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Lake Victoria extends into three east African countries, allowing cross-border flow of goods and people, and a market day in a lakeside town in Homa Bay County often boasts traders from Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, all of whom arrive in boats to ply their wares. Although the semi-arid nature of much of Homa Bay County means that poverty rates are quite high, many people in the region hold a strong cultural emphasis on education, and as a result, school attendance figures around Homa Bay are above the national average. \r\n\r\nSela is married and has six children. She engages in grain banking (storing grains in the harvest season to sell in the low seasons to make a profit) and cares for orphans. She is currently taking care of seven orphans. Her husband used to be a fisherman but now runs a grinding mill that turns maize and other grains into flour. Sela has been farming for 30 years and is currently growing maize, millet, lentils, beans, groundnuts and amaranth, as well as tending to cows and poultry.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nReuben is married and has six children. He works as a primary teacher and his wife works on their farm and in their house. In his free time, he loves soccer and watching movies. He has been farming for 10 years and is currently growing maize, millet, sorghum, peas and beans. He also keeps a variety of livestock including cows, goats, sheep and poultry, and he cultivates natural forests on his land.

This is William. He is the deputy head teacher of Kiwafu Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Kitooro in Entebbe with 1,237 students. Kiwafu Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKiwafu Primary will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Juliet. She is the head teacher Jerodin Primary School, a mixed school in the Peri-urban area of Kitooro in Entebbe with 350 students. Jerodin Primary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nJerodin Primary will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank.

For this reason, her father is very proud of her and wants to give his daughter a good future but he was not able to send her to a good university.  Therefore, Brenda was not in school for six months until she saw an advertisement for CampoAlto.  She immediately called and was given the names of the courses that were offered.  The ones that caught her attention were related to the Nursing Assistant Program.  She could see herself in the end studying for a degree in which she could enjoy helping other people without expecting anything in return.  If there were some point in which something happened in her family, then she will have gained knowledge that would be helpful.  \r\n\r\nSince that time, Brenda is pleased with what she has learned to date because she knows there are great things in store for her in the future.  Someday she will enjoy greater well-being and become a successful person.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

Rebeca sees beekeeping as a business with many benefits: it does not require much capital or work, but still provides honey (which is medicinal), pollinates crops and helps improve the environment.\r\n\r\nThis is Rebeca\u2019s first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her hives to pay school fees for her children and expand her samosa business.

is an experienced farmer from the Prey Chhor district of Kampong Cham.

Having been in this business for almost 15 years, she earns approximately KHR 20,000 per day. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve the income of her family, Sary has considered creating a new business of tailoring clothes because she has enough skills for this type of business.
