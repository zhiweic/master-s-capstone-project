tries to improve their standard of living and jump-start the economic situation of their family. She is a 45-year-old widow with 2 children. After the death of her husband, it was very difficult for her to manage to provide for her children. She grew crops for a living, but her earnings from this activity were not enough for her to buy all the basic necessities for her kids. Sarvar has decided to set up a new business for the welfare of her family. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She wants to get into the field of buying and selling cattle. Animal husbandry is a very developed business where she lives, and there is a lot of opportunity for her to make a good income. She plans to use the money generated by this loan to get the latest technology for her children. Sarvar is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle so she can start up her business. She is waiting for your kindness.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to set up a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarvar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":38.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.47},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":49.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":595.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740909,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T13:57:56Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507133,"name":"Ponciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ponciana is a merchant from Panglao, Bohol.

Her husband is a kind man who works as an economist at a factory. Nasibakhon is the head of the human resources department at the polyclinic in her hometown. She is very intelligent, and has a post-secondary education. Her eldest son is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation, and every month he sends money home to help out. However, despite all their efforts, their combined family income is not sufficient for them to cover all their living expenses. Nasibakhon wants to buy winter wear, namely coats and jackets, for herself and her children, but she does not have enough money to do so. Winters in northern Tajikistan are quite cold, but this family does not have warm clothing. Nasibakhon is seeking a loan of 1,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy winter wear. This loan will help her to buy clothes that will enable her to protect her children from the cold, and she promises to pay it off on time. All her hopes are on you. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1253895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To buy winter clothes for herself and her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasibakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.39,"local_amount":68.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":73.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740911,"comment":null},{"amount":39.32,"local_amount":174.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":187.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056214,"comment":null},{"amount":18.09,"local_amount":80.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":86.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801913,"comment":null},{"amount":18.14,"local_amount":80.61,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":86.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510159,"comment":null},{"amount":18.68,"local_amount":83.04,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915445,"comment":null},{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":86.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693153,"comment":null},{"amount":20.11,"local_amount":89.38,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":95.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555965,"comment":null},{"amount":20.29,"local_amount":90.17,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549829,"comment":null},{"amount":21.21,"local_amount":94.27,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958804,"comment":null},{"amount":21.65,"local_amount":96.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":103.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420074973,"comment":null},{"amount":12.76,"local_amount":56.69,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":60.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227681,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T16:10:51Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507135,"name":"Enkhbadral","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Enkhbadral, 23, lives with his wife and daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

years old, married, and has 2 children. She and her children live in an old house, but her husband has left for the Russian Federation and does not help his wife with the home repairs. They have had this housing problem for several years, but have been unable to deal with it because they have a low salary. Zamira has been working in a private company for several years. Her income goes towards providing for her family because supporting 2 children in today's world is not easy and requires a great deal of money. Zamira has taken out loans from our organisation before and has a good credit history. She fulfilled all the plans that she had hoped to with the help of her previous loans from IMON. This time, she has decided to take another loan so she can repair her house, because she no longer hopes for support from her husband. She needs to carry out repairs in her children's rooms and the kitchen. Zamira is seeking a loan of 2,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy building materials for home repairs. She and her children will wait for kind lenders to help them resolve their housing problems.

She is a very hard-working woman. From a young age she has had specific goals and has tried to realise them. She had a cherished childhood dream of becoming a fashion designer like Maria Lopez. This dream led her to learn now to sew women's clothing. For several years, she has gained experience in this field, and 4 months ago, she set up her own business. She took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate. She has been trying very hard to develop her business but has not yet been able to because her sewing machine is very old and does a poor job. Her clients have made several complaints. If she cannot get a new sewing machine, her clients will start going to a different seamstress. Farangis is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy a sewing machine to develop her new business. She is waiting for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine to develop her new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farangis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":38.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":595.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740913,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T14:51:23Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507146,"name":"Vicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicent is a thirty-eight-year-old married man with eight children living in Bundibugyo, Uganda.

She will use the loan to buy additional stock of medicines and mineral water to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Nida hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1254858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To pay for more stock of medicines and mineral water needed in her pharmacy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Her husband is a miller, and she grows crops. With each passing year, her children need more things and her earnings are not sufficient to cover the costs of providing for her kids. Her husband's income is also small. \r\nHurmat has decided to set up her own business. For this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate. Now she is fully capable of setting up her own business and becoming successful at it. She wants to get into the business of raising and selling cattle because there is great demand for animal husbandry in her region. She will buy cattle, raise them, then later re-sell them for a profit, thereby earning an income. She plans to use the money generated by this loan to provide her children with a good education and nutritious food. Hurmat is seeking a loan of 500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy cattle to get her new business started. She is waiting for your kindness. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1253936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

As\u00ed mismo comprar\u00e1, para atender la demanda de su mercado,  ropa, calzado y detalles femeninos, para que los clientes y sus familias, se vistan muy elegantes y reciban las navidades y el a\u00f1o nuevo, con ropa que ha comprado en la miscel\u00e1nea de Felipa que le permite a ella ganar un poco m\u00e1s de lo acostumbrado, como ocurre siempre a final del a\u00f1o.","en":"Felipa is 56 years old and has a business in which she sells a little of everything, including beer, stationery, accessories for the home, internet services and telecommunications.  Her business is located in a part of her home, where she lives with her spouse and four children, who are between the ages of 10 and 20 years.  Felipa began her life as an entrepreneur by buying a crate of beer which she then sold retail.  The immediate profits she earned from this venture encouraged her to reinvest and gradually increase her product line with various merchandise, such as women\u2019s accessories, stationary and even an internet caf\u00e9.  Most of her sales are done on a cash basis, although she also has customers to whom she sells on credit, but before offering financing she observes their behavior and only gradually gives them this option.  Her workday begins at 7 am and lasts until 10 pm.  She puts a lot of effort into her business because she is determined to add a second floor to her home so that she can separate her personal life from her workspace and have some more peace.\r\n\r\nFelipa is currently applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy beer by the crate, which she will distribute through stores and commercial establishments.  She plans to make good use of the approaching holiday season when consumption increases and inventories of drinks are exhausted very quickly at a time of maximum selling potential.  At the same time, in order to satisfy the demand of her customers, she will buy clothing, footwear and women\u2019s accessories, so that her customers and their families will be well dressed for Christmas and New Year with clothing from her shop.  This will allow her to earn a little more than the usual, as always occurs at year end.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1247024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy beer by the crate, clothing, footwear and women\u2019s accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felipa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80049},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84553},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86526},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88545},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90611},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92725},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94889},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97103},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":99369},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101687},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104060},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":109883}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":164602,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":170664.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071621,"comment":null},{"amount":46.59,"local_amount":81001,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83984.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527644,"comment":null},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":94070,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":97534.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705553,"comment":null},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":90611,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":93948.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817044,"comment":null},{"amount":402.5,"local_amount":699716,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":725486.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731692,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-29T18:28:03Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:12:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507166,"name":"Muradi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muradi is from the Terjola district.

He is married and is raising four children. His wife Salomat is a very kind woman and a good homemaker. His children are still young and therefore Tojiddin is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to provide for the family, he started his own business 12 years ago buying and selling livestock. His efficiency helps him to be successful in his business. He is gradually learning all aspects of his business and his customers are satisfied from his activities. Tojiddin has a car that needs repair. He is unable to repair the car and so he is requesting a loan for 3,000 Somoni for car repairs.

earns a living by selling fruit, maize and gari (or pickled vegetables) in the town of Elmina. To prepare the gari, she buys raw fresh cassavas from the market. She washes and peels them, and then sends them to a mill to be turned into dough. Gari is popular among students and large families. Students eat it often because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak gari with condensed milk and water, and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare gari in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines.

He lives with his wife, Ceferina, and their six children, who they raise in a house that Rodolfo bought twelve years ago. \r\n\r\nTwelve years ago, Rodolfo set up his guinea pig farm in an area of his home. He raises 500 guinea pigs there, which he looks after very professionally. He separates them according to their genetic traits, thereby avoiding inbreeding. As a result he gets good animals to sell. \r\n\r\n\"I have regular customers for my guinea pigs, because they are a vitamin-rich foodstuff. Black guinea pigs also sell well in the market, because people believe that they cure certain ills.\" he says. \r\n\r\nHe now hopes to increase production, as he has lots of land on which to farm as well as many customers, and he can't meet the demand. That is why he hopes to be successful in his new challenge. \r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP. He is very happy to know he has financial support, and he likes being part of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive.

","en":"Mahabat is 35 years old, married, and is raising five children, the youngest daughter of which is a newborn. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income since 1990, Mahabat has been engaged in raising livestock and agriculture, starting with 15,000 Som and the purchase of one cow. Mahabat received land before the breakup of the USSR where she does annual planting of beans and potatoes. Through hard work, Mahabat and her family currently have in their household one dairy cow, a horse, 30 sheep, and two goats. Monthly income from the business is 3,500 Som KGS from the sale of milk and dairy products. Income from growing crops allows her to buy sheep and cattle at the end of the season. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Mahabat appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy livestock and to pay for preparation of her land for seeding.

Elsury prepared to be an assistant clinical laboratory technician in the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, a public institution in Colombia.  This allowed her to begin working to finance her studies in nutrition and dietetics at the University of Antioquia.  During her program, Elsury began to become interested in the areas of public nutrition and research on the social factors that determine the state of community nutrition and health.  \n\nCurrently Elsury works in research and is a professor in a university.  Nevertheless, her salary is very low and it's not enough to realize her dream of undertaking the master's degree in community health.\n\nThe help of Kiva will allow Elsury to achieve her dream of finishing her graduate work so she can expand her knowledge of determiners of health inequality, get to know other cultures, perfect her knowledge of French and English, grow as a professional and as a person, and contribute to the development of her country.\n\nHere's her story:\n\n\"Since I was a little girl I've had a high social sense and have wanted to learn about the well-being of others.  Thanks to my job and my dedication I had the possibility of undertaking my technical and university studies in public institutions in my country.  This increased my need to contribute to national development and to the improvement of the living conditions of the population.\n\n\"Realizing this goal is what drives me to study the determiners of health inequality and motivates me to undertake the master's in community health in one of the best universities in Canada.  The knowledge and experiences I will acquire will help me to grow as a professional and as a person.  More importantly, they will give me the tools to serve society and assure that public health and nutrition policies will be more effective.\n\n\"Throughout my entire life I have sought to develop all my abilities, I have strived to make my dreams come true, and I have managed to realize them because of the love and energy I put into everything I do.\n\n\"I am convinced that when people put all their effort into something and are perseverant, they manage to overcome all the obstacles.  Since I decided to do my master's degree, I have faced many difficulties that I am sure I will be able to resolve by having the support and the help of Kiva.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1255320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application fees for her master's degree in community health","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsury","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1660000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":1660000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1661756.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042092,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-15T01:10:46Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507749,"name":"El Rosario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este es el Grupo \u201cEl Rosario\u201d que conforman 09 socios  que se dedican a diversas actividades de comercio que pasan al ciclo 17.

He is a conscientious, goal-focused, and hardworking man. He was born in a rural area with good conditions for crop cultivation and raising livestock. \r\n\r\nMamur's son is currently in Russia, but he doesn't have consistent source of work. So Mamur cannot count on having money sent home by his son and works himself, raising crops and animals. As a result, he has a fair amount of experience in animal husbandry and agriculture. His main crops are wheat, barley and corn. Mamur uses his harvested crops to buy livestock at the market for low prices. He then fattens the animals up for a certain period of time, and resells the livestock at high prices. The livestock is maintained by feed that Mamur himself grows. Mamur's wife helps him run the business.\r\n\r\nWith the income he makes from his business, Mamur has improved his living conditions. This year Mamur planted 5 hectacres of barley, wheat and corn.

is 28 years old, married, and the father of five children. The children are three boys and two girls, ranging in age from 1 to 10 years. Two of them go to school. The family lives together in a minority community in Kosovo. \r\n\r\nSince 2005 Refik has worked in his own business, carrying wood for others, using his horse. This is the main income source for his family. Refik is a very hard-working man, who works a lot to support his family. He uses his horse to carry wood in his area. The money he earns from this season he must save, also, for the spring and summer seasons when he does not have a lot of work to do.\r\n \r\nRecently the family moved into a new house in another place, and Refik wants to build a new stable for his horse. He is requesting a loan of 1,300 EUR in order to build a new stable for his horse. The loan will help him to have a place for the horse and to continue his business, which is very fruitful in this cold weather. He hopes in the future to ensure a better life for his family. His goal is to give a better education to his children. He is very grateful to all Kiva lenders!

","en":"Zamira is 46 years old and has 1 child. She is a very kind and hard-working woman, but her fate has been a difficult one. Her husband left her and their child, and does not provide any child support. Zamira has to manage to meet all expenses on her own. Her tough situation forced her to start her own business as a means of earning an income. For more than 7 years, she has been working in the field of processing and selling dried fruit, such as apricots. In the summer, she picks the apricots, processes them and sells them at the market as dried apricots, and she also sells other fruit that she buys from wholesalers. She is very courteous with her customers, so she has a large clientele. She uses her earnings from the business to pay for her child's food, clothes and education. She now wants to further develop her business. She needs to buy more goods to sell, but she does not have the financial means to do so. Zamira is asking for a loan of 1,500 Tajikistan Somoni to buy dried apricots. She is a repeat borrower of ours and has a good credit history. She is waiting for your kindness and promises to pay back the loan on time.

She is a fighting woman, friendly and hardworking. She lives with her husband William, 28 years old and they have a 3 year old daughter called Jeslyn. At the moment she lives in her mother-in-law\u2019s home, a place where she and her husband share the happiness of educating and raising her daughter and putting all their efforts and sacrifices towards providing her a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nElena sells groceries like rice, sugar, milk, eggs, oil, and she also sells soft drinks, sweets, fruits and other products. She has a space in her house for this activity where she serves her customers daily. In the afternoon she has a stand in front of the school in the area where she lives and there she works during recess until the time her children leave. \r\n\r\nShe considers the most difficult part of her work having to be under the harsh sun that is so intense in the afternoon. She has been doing this activity for seven years. She works alone while her husband works on his motorcycle taxi. What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to do other things. Now she wants to implement a more expanded store with quality products. She hopes to soon achieve her goal and continue on the road to success and prosperity for the wellbeing of her family.\r\n\r\nThis is the eighth loan through MFP, so she is grateful to those who have made her loans possible so she can continue towards her objectives, and on her end she is very committed to once again complete her payments punctually as she did with previous loans she took. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank since all the members are very good, friendly, and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the amount requested (2500 soles), she will buy more groceries such as rice, sugar, milk, eggs and oil, and also she will buy various sweets, fruit, and other products that children consume, and this way she hopes to maintain a stable income.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1256087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sweets, fruits and other products that children consume","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-15T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-14T01:10:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":377.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":397.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":396.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":443.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":457.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.09,"local_amount":377.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":377.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189088,"comment":null},{"amount":155.21,"local_amount":397.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":398.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573021,"comment":null},{"amount":154.62,"local_amount":396.45,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":396.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122663,"comment":null},{"amount":166.77,"local_amount":427.62,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":428.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868489,"comment":null},{"amount":172.99,"local_amount":443.57,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":444.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577320,"comment":null},{"amount":178.32,"local_amount":457.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":457.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-21T06:02:26Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507784,"name":"Eddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eddy dreams of working in public finance.

Both she and her husband are now retired, and aside from their pension, their main source of income comes from raising livestock and growing crops. Thanks to their hard work, Rysbubu and her husband now have 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, and 10 sheep on their farm. Rysbubu also cultivates 2.8 hectares of land, where she grows beans and potatoes. With the goal of expanding her business, Rysbubu turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 some (KGS) to purchase young livestock for fattening and resale.

She is 24 years old, married, and has one child. Her husband has gone to the Russian Federation, but he doesn't send back enough money for her to make ends meet. Muborak needs a source of income, and this became the reason behind the idea of starting a new business.  She found out from a neighbor about a course organized by the Association of Businesswomen called \"Achieve success\", and read more about it in an ad. She took the course and receive a certificate.

She's in a relationship with David, 32.  Together they have a child from their love, Milena, age 7, for whom she works hard and makes sacrifices every day.  She works hard to be able to give her a better quality of life.  Currently they live in their own house, which she got with so much effort and dedication.  There they share their days as a close family.\r\n\r\nCarmen makes a living mainly selling parts, components, and accessories for all types of vehicles, basically for motorcycle taxis.  She also performs  maintenance and repair on motorcycle taxis that have operating defects.  Thanks to the excellent quality of her work she's recognized as one of the best in this area and has become one of the best known in the city.  She shares this renown with her husband David, who also has worked with her since she started the business two years ago.\r\n\r\nThey have a lot of customers and she's always highly recommended.  This generates security and financial stability because the flow of customers is high every day.  They do this job in a place they rented together and although in the beginning it was a bit difficult because they were worried and had doubts, they didn't allow themselves to be frightened, and now they're making progress and want to continue growing.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is seeing that her customers are happy when they observe that the vehicles end up in good condition and functioning perfectly.  This is a satisfaction she knows and shares up close because she also has two motorcycle taxis.  Her big goal is to get a bigger place where she can offer better customer service and have more spare parts in various brands, whether to sell them or to continue doing good repair work.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1000 soles (PEN) she'll increase her stock of spare parts, components, accessories, and tools in her shop, including chambers, gears, tires, bolts, oil, and other parts in various brands.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1256081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

:{"en":"Malkhazi is 37 years old and lives in Zestaponi district, with his wife and two children (three and nine years old). The elder son is a schoolboy and the younger daughter goes to the local kindergarten. The only source for the family is the small income earned by Malkhaz. He is involved in a trading business. In particular, he buys fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices, transports them by his own car and sells at the local open market.   Malkhazi managed to make some savings and built a store, where he plans to set up a grocery. He has requested a loan several times, but his loan requests were rejected each time because he did not meet income requirements and he lacks experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. But Malkhazi\u2019s loan request was approved by Credo, as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups and re-startups. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Malkhazi will cover the costs of purchasing his initial inventory of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.  Malkhazi will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions for his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular, available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event they need it in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1255635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to start

and married. All of Zuura's children are grown and living on their own. In search of a source of funding, Zuura started her own business 30 years ago in livestock, starting with the purchase of a dairy cow and five sheep. Through hard work and perseverance, Zuura today has in her farm two dairy cows, one hourse, and 25 sheep, bringing about 7,000 Som (KGS) per month from the sale of milk and meat products. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase the number of her livestock, Zuura appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy calves and sheep. The family plans to invest income from the loan to further multiplying the number of livestock and improving the welfare of the

","en":"Marziya is 41 yeras old, married, and the mother of three children. Her eldest son is an adult and works in Russia, and the younger is attending school. After the collapse of the USSR and the collective farms, Marziya received her own plot of land. And since she was engaged in cattle breading and cultivating field crops, she started her own business with the acquisition of one cow. \r\n\r\nThrough her efforts and hard work, Marziya today has a developed farm with two cows and ten head of sheep.

She is married and has children. Sharofat is engaged in making flatbreads. This is a family business. She is helped by her husband, son, and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nNot long ago, she installed a big new tandoor (national oven) and now ever day they bake through four bags of flour which yields about 1,200 flatbreads. \r\n\r\nFrom these earnings, they also increase the family budget. This business is the only source of income for the family.

desire to rise above her circumstances. She is originally from Managua, with a background in business, and she has her high school diploma. She is the proud mother of three children, only one of which she still has under her direct care; an 11-year-old daughter who is currently enrolled in middle school. She has been selling clothing and shoes for eight years. \r\n\r\nShe began her business with money that she had personally saved. She had a clothing shop in the past, but it burned down in the municipality of San Carlos del Rio San Juan. Going off of her previous business, she decided to sell groceries from a spare room in her house, and she does receive some financial support from her daughter. Her products are sold within her own community and in the surrounding grocery stores in the area. She feels satisfied with her business because it is more profitable, and she can count on steady clients. \r\n\r\nShe would like to use the loan to buy sugar, beans, oil, rice, detergent, soap, and other products necessary to outfit her grocery store. She would be very grateful for the loan, as it would be of great help to her further investment in her business and to attract more customers, generating at the same time more income. Her future plans include making repairs and improvements on her house and eventually buying a car, but her next goal is to expand her business.

They have three grown children. \r\n\r\nDespite his age, Abdukayum works very hard. For over ten years, he has been a great fisherman. Every morning he gets up early and goes to the sea with the hope to catch fish and in this way to live through the day. He catches primarily 20-25kg of fish per day and sells it at the local market. His son helps him in this work. They live not far from the sea and it is convenient for fishing. Abdukayum buys food, clothing, and other necessary means for living. Abdukayum's family is satisfied to have such a caring father and husband. \r\n\r\nBut year after year Abdukayum's health is deteriorating. He is seriously ill and urgently needs treatment. Abdukayum has no money for treatment and therefore applied for a loan of 2,000 Somoni to buy medication. He is awaiting and hopes for your kindness. He promises to repay the loan on time.

Karomat always dreamed of having her own business, and so two years ago started her own cattle breeding business. \r\n \r\nShe has two cows. She has a large garden where she grows hay for the cattle. She sells cattle that she watched over the course of 15 days. She sells cattle twice per month. The market has many customers.

She is married and has three small children. She lives with her husband's parents. They are pensioners, and her husband does odd jobs. \r\n\r\nFor more than seven years, Mavluda has been keeping and looking after domestic livestock and considers this a very good and beneficial activity as it provides milk and dairy products to her family.

According to national traditions, Tajiks have many ceremonies and events, one of which is the birth of a grandchild. As grandmother, Mutabar must prepare many gifts and put on a big event. To do this, Tajiks save money, but with a state salary it is not possible to save up much. \r\n\r\nWith the loan received, Mutabar wants to buy gifts for her grandson and to host an event. She looks forward to the help and support from Kiva and sends her thanks in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":559.04,"image":{"id":1252807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

But due to financial constraints, she is unable to purchase it. \r\n\r\nFor that, as a member of a six-person lending group, she has requested a loan from Kiva's Partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Rebecca is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kamwenge, in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is single and has two children who are currently in school. For the past three years, Rebecca has been working hard to manage her tailoring business. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rebecca has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more materials for making clothes for sale. It will help Rebecca to generate greater profits and to develop herself more, in terms of business ability and providing good basic needs. Rebecca hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy cows for her family. \r\n\r\nRebecca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills
