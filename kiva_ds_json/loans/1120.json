My husband Javier drives a taxi, so we both bring income to support or family.\n\nI have a small local where I sell candies. Occasionally I go selling door to door or outside of schools.  I stoped selling cosmetics five months ago, because I didnt have money to buy inventory, but now I want to get back to selling cosmetics because I already have some recurring clients, but I will continue to sell candies.

their combined skills and expertise, Bianca and her fianc\u00e9 created Wavvy Barber and Beauty Salon, a full-service, family-oriented barber shop and beauty salon that offers both the traditional services found in many chain hair salons, and a number of unique touches that help it stand apart from the San Antonio competition. These include spa services (manicures, pedicures, etc.) and hairstyles such as tapers, edge-ups and perms. \r\n\r\nAs the company\u2019s owner, Bianca established a firm mission to provide the highest quality services at affordable prices. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and an inviting environment are trademarks of the Wavvy brand. Bianca feels that these are the components that will keep her clients returning to the salon time and time again.\r\n\r\nIn the process of developing her business plan, financing was the one major roadblock Bianca encountered. But she didn\u2019t let that deter her. While doing research online about financing options, Bianca came across the Accion Texas Inc. website. She reached out to the lending staff and worked with them to qualify for a loan to launch her business. Now Bianca can purchase new equipment, as well as create a website to complement the social media components that are essential to her marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nBianca is thrilled to take the first step towards opening the Wavvy Barber and Beauty Salon. She has defined concrete goals that she would like her business to accomplish, including the addition of 10 full-time employees who will embrace the Wavvy mission and help it reach its revenue goals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1224.29,"image":{"id":1350039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She eventually found herself working for a major consumer electronics company, where she was tasked with managing marketing efforts for new technologies, which included experiential marketing events. Not to her surprise, she absolutely loved this role!\r\n\r\nShe eventually took her passion for event planning and launched her own business, Charisma Events & Consulting, in 2012, specializing in planning a wide variety of events from birthday parties to weddings to business expositions. Eventually finding her niche, Kadesha focused her business primarily on planning weddings.\r\n\r\nKnowing what it was like to plan her own wedding on a budget, Kadesha prides herself in helping clients plan their dream weddings on a personalized budget that works for them. Her core business philosophy has always been to treat customers as extended family, and she takes pride in the relationships she builds with her clients as well as with her vendors. Being a strong believer in marriage, Kadeha strives not only to plan great events, but to encourage all the couples she works with.\r\n\r\nAfter being in business for a little over two years, Kadesha is finally ready to take her business to the next level. She is going to use her $2,000 Kiva loan to move into her own office space and purchase an inventory of wedding dresses to sell and rent to the brides she works with. With this expansion, she hopes to truly become a one-stop-shop for wedding planning.\r\n\r\nWith her driven, go-getter attitude, Kadesha hopes to eventually open a local wedding boutique and grow her business to the point of being able to franchise her shops across the country.\r\n\r\nCheck out Charisma Events on the web:

Even at a young age she liked the field of healthcare and wanted to be a great doctor or nurse. When she finished school, she gave birth to her daughter and had to wait a year to study. For economic reasons, she was not able to study medicine, so studying to be a licensed practical nurse seemed like a good start. Time passed, and after her daughter reached 6 months of age Alejandra started to work because she needed to earn money to study. She started working at a bar and saved all the money she could. After a year of working, she searched on the internet for schools where she could study to be a licensed practical nurse. She had never heard of Campo Alto, but an old friend who had completed the same degree there found out that she was looking for schools and highly recommended Campo Alto. So, Alejandra went there to look around and ask about what she would need, and she liked it a lot. That was when she decided to start studying there.\r\nBefore she started she had to think about who would care for her daughter. Being a young mother, her parents have always supported her with her studies, but they weren't able to take care of her daughter. Alejandra enrolled her in daycare, and this took a lot of work. Once her daughter was settled, Alejandra started to study. She is now in her second semester and is very happy because she knows that her hard work will be rewarded one way or another. She has very much enjoyed studying at Campo Alto. The professors are excellent and her fellow students are very friendly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1350414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her studies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-05-16T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-15T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":305466.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891062,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152733.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-16T16:10:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559789,"name":"Alejandra Camila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra es una mujer de 21 a\u00f1os, es soltera, vive en la ciudad de Ica con sus padres y hermanos, ella es una persona muy amable, trabajadora y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n; lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos y por la necesidad que tuvo de trabajar para ayudar a sus padres, Alejandra no ha podido estudiar la carrera profesional de Administraci\u00f3n que desea, en sus ratos libres le gusta dedicar un poco de tiempo a la lectura y en algunas ocasiones cocina una riqu\u00edsima Carapulcra para compartir con su familia.\nPor iniciativa propia, con mucho empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, Alejandra trabaja como vendedora en un centro fotogr\u00e1fico de su ciudad, ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas atendiendo a clientes y puede hacerlo por un aproximado de 10 horas, ella cree que le va bien por su buen desempe\u00f1o y por el trato amable que brinda a los dem\u00e1s.\nAlejandra se encuentra muy agradecida con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada podr\u00e1 realizar el mejoramiento de una habitaci\u00f3n en su vivienda, ya que esta solo tiene piso de tierra y requiere ponerle piso de concreto, de esta manera Alejandra y su familia tendr\u00e1n mayor seguridad y bienestar, as\u00ed pues ella seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de estudiar una carrera profesional.\n","en":"Alejandra is 21 years old.

She is asking for this loan in order to buy fruit such as bananas, apples, pineapples, melons, avocados and other fruit in order to offer a greater variety of items in her business. In this manner she can continue selling fruit as she has done in the past.

One of the members, Flordelina, sells farm products and all kinds of food products.  When she can, she sells anything, even clothing or shoes.

Frustrated, the 35-year-old wanted to start over with a new career.  Searching for a new business idea, Carlos found apps and it felt like home. \n\nMyriad Co. began in June 2011, developing cell phone applications. One product, Fishing for Words, is an app inspired by Carlos\u2019 love for fishing.  He even has professional fisherman Bill Dance sponsoring the project to promote awareness.  The app is similar to the well-known game, Words with Friends, but with a twist.  The major difference will be that Fishing for Words will have a dictionary to define words, a rating system, 15- and 30-minute game timers for those looking for a short game and it can be played in Spanish, Japanese and French.\n\nWorking in his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., Carlos already has an app on the market, an automatic-reply app for Android called Autovoxt. Carlos says he wanted a job where he could relax and still get paid, and once he saw the demand for apps, \u201cI saw the vision and I studied the market.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo one taught me. The Internet and Google are your best tools,\u201d he says.  However, a background in computers helped. Carlos works as an IT administrator at a hospital where his coworkers are familiar with his side job. One co-worker advised him to visit Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), a local free confidential counseling nonprofit organization for start-up businesses seeking advice, in Memphis, for financial support. \n\nThey referred him to Accion Texas Inc.  He used the Accion loan to finish the Fishing for Words app process, but mainly to create business cards and posters that have the app logo and instructions on how to download it. \n\n\u201cMy goal is to get 10,000 downloads the first week,\u201d he says. \n\nHis long-term goals are to hire those he contracts with in United States, Japan and India. \u201cWe have plans, if this expands, then these people will come under my umbrella. They\u2019ll move to Memphis and be my employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat separates the market is what separates Apple from PC. I have lots of ideas for apps. I compare myself to Myspace and Facebook.

She finished her primary education and then couldn't continue her studies because her parents were not able to support her financially. Her parents taught her how to work in agriculture, which continues to be the way she earns a living for herself, her parents and her children. The family works together on different agricultural activities as they support the family by farming. Their crops are marketed and sold in local markets on a small scale by the different vendors in the area.\r\n\r\nCurrently Erlin is asking for help to buy agricultural inputs, which will improve her coffee and vegetable crops.

Together with her partner she transports the whole harvest to the market and every time that they get money they use it smartly. Part of it goes to daily expenses and another part to invest in their fields. \r\n\r\nCristina's goal is to build her own home, but for now she will keep planting her crops, taking advantage of this month's rains. This is her second loan with Kiva and she promises to make her payments punctually. She will invest the 2000 soles in the purchase of organic compost for her plants."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":592.91,"image":{"id":1351570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":174.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":178.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":169.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":191.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":186.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":205.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":213.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":214.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":229.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":235.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":67.74,"local_amount":174.81,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:50:02Z","rounded_local_amount":176.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530565,"comment":null},{"amount":69.21,"local_amount":178.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":180.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975611,"comment":null},{"amount":65.74,"local_amount":169.63,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":170.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996880,"comment":null},{"amount":74.24,"local_amount":191.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":193.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864351,"comment":null},{"amount":151.31,"local_amount":390.47,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":393.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904488,"comment":null},{"amount":81.46,"local_amount":210.23,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":211.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090541,"comment":null},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":214.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777308,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T13:31:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559325,"name":"Musheera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musheera is a 40-year-old married woman.

Her business gradually started to bear fruit and, although she now has a market stall, she needs to extend to other markets so as to increase her sales, make savings and eventually have a new and bigger shop of her own.  Celia sells her goods for cash or credit 7 days a week from 8am to 5pm and collects the money owed to her on a weekly basis.  She uses this money to make cash purchases in the town centre, where she qualifies for special volume discounts.  This would be far more effective if she had more money to invest.  It is for that very reason that she is applying to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first Kiva loan.  She will use it to buy clothing, footwear and other items for women, increase her purchasing power, offer a wider range of goods and, as a result, boost her income.  This is how she intends to make successful use of her Kiva loan.

This is also her greatest challenge. Yunis is now seeking a loan from Kiva, the first time she has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the money she plans to buy fabric, thread and other sewing necessities. She will be able to increase production and lower costs through buying in volume, just what the loans are intended to achieve.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":466.27,"image":{"id":1352095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"buy fabric, thread and other sewing necessities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yunis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":112892},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":115526},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":118222},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120981},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":123803},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126692},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":129648},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":132673},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":135769},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":138937},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":142179},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":145497},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":148891},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152366},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":155924}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.09,"local_amount":112892,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":113902.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705964,"comment":null},{"amount":63.54,"local_amount":115526,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":116560.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968252,"comment":null},{"amount":65.02,"local_amount":118222,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":119280.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817435,"comment":null},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":120981,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":122064.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323709,"comment":null},{"amount":68.09,"local_amount":123803,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":124911.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082942,"comment":null},{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":126692,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127826.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062300,"comment":null},{"amount":71.31,"local_amount":129648,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":130808.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T02:41:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559362,"name":"Asiya's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiya is a 45-year-old woman.

59, is a farmer. He is married and the father of one son. He has been raising seasonal fruits and vegetables for the past thirteen years. He chose this business because it is profitable and because there is always high demand for fresh food. People use fresh vegetables every day and include them in many national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every family table in Azerbaijan and are often made into fresh punch. Tahir sells his crops in the Sabirabad central bazaar. His monthly income is 400 AZN. His son actively helps him to raise his crops. Tahir also receives a pension.

Leishembi is the featured borrower member, and she is pictured with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nShe is married now with three children. She runs a tea shop and also weaves traditional attire. \r\n\r\nLeishembi's main business is weaving and her woven products are women's wrap-around skirts and traditional shawls. She was making a good profit but her sales entirely depend on the festive season. She makes good sales during marriages, send-offs and other events and sales goes down once it is off season. So she also started running the tea shop in the front yard of her house. \r\n\r\nThe tea shop is near the main lane in the neighbourhood, which adds an advantage for her business. The tea shop is a popular place for all age groups in the neighbourhood. She is jolly and also a very good chef. Elders, women and children love the foods Leishembi prepares. People swarm in the tea shop especially in the morning and at noon time. \r\n\r\nShe serves Puri, chow-mein, smash potato fry and toast. Many school-going children depend on her tea shop for breakfast and she works hard to prepare so the children can eat their breakfasts and be on time for class. Besides running the tea shop, she also weaves at night and also gets finished woven products from other weavers and supplies them for profit to the women vendors at the main market. With both the businesses in hand, Leishembi now has a daily income as well as seasonal income, which enables her to make savings.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase sacks of flour and wheat and a full tin of edible oils for her tea shop. With the profits she will order woven products from other weavers and sell them for profits. Her growth in financial stability since the inception in the group has been huge and beneficial says Leishembi. She has managed to open a bank account and also send her children to private schools for better educational quality. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the impending financial assistance and support towards the group.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1347824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase sacks of flour and wheat, a tin of edible oils and necessary supplies for her tea shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A.leishembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A.inaobi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maloti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Y.punimashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N.shantibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T18:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559365,"name":"Rufat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufat is 60 years old, married, and has three adult children.

is a 34-year-old married woman. She lives in Tulkarem in a small house with her husband. Su'ad's husband is a worker with low wages, which barely cover the family's needs.

Since her husband passed away, she takes care of her three children. She takes both the father's and mother's roles and shows strong character.\r\n\r\nShe has continued extensive aquaculture, which she and her husband used to do. She uses the pond that was dug by her husband and his friends and then raises fish in the pond, which is located just across the house. \r\n\r\nManaging the family expenses with the retirement monthly pension of her husband was difficult. In order to supplement the family income, she joined the group and availed loan.  \r\n\r\nShe bought hundreds of fry and twats with her first loan. She also bought feed from the markets called powdered-husk. Since it is an extensive aquaculture, she entirely depends on the natural vegetation of the pond. She usually feeds the powdered husk in smaller quantities at a consistent time. She usually sells the fish to women vendors in the town market when they are full grown. \r\n\r\nShe says there was a time when all the fish died from an unknown cause. She was disappointed, but her love for fish farming urged her to continue raising fish. She says it is multipurpose because she loves raising fish and at the same time it generates income. She uses the profit for her children's education and the rest is used for household maintenance. She also managed to join the group's savings and she is happy to be part of the Sahei Group.\r\n\r\nShe says that neighbours' children and poultry get inside the house perimeter and play in the fish pond. She says it is sometimes rude to chase or chide the children and that eventually creates enmity between neighbours.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase fencing nets for the fish pond. If she can arrange a proper fencing for the fish pond, then she won\u2019t have to worry about the fish in the pond. She says thank you to Kiva and WSDS for the support and says please continue helping us.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, cattle rearing, ginger farming, vegetable selling and a paan shop.

He lives in Khashuri District with wife and father, who is provided with a retirement pension. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Nowadays the family is out of sources of income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

Also in the summer time, she sells bricks and sand to people who are in need of house building materials. With her previous loan, she finished building her own house, but during last three years the house is deteriorated due to strong storms and frosts. So she is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, fiberglass, cements and planks. Using these materials, she can repair and insulate her house which will provide a more comfortable and warmer place for her children. Also the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

In April, 9 years ago, he set up his own business, having been encouraged to do so by his mother-in-law, who has always been a shopkeeper. She passed on her knowledge to her young daughter who then helped her mother in the business.  When they got married, Luis' wife decided to start selling clothing and underwear, small electrical appliances and footwear, for which there had been a previous demand among her customers.  Their business gradually grew and so Luis used what he had saved from his redundancy pay to expand the business, in which his wife still serves the customers, while he works as an employee so as to generate two incomes and increase his family's wellbeing.  They sell goods for cash and on credit and make purchases in cash in the city of Barranquilla, where the warehouses and distributors offer them the best prices.  Today Luis' great ambition is to see the family business grow even more and that is why he is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first Kiva loan, which he will use to buy sets of cookware, small electrical appliances, household goods, clothing and footwear, because sales of these goods are increasing as Mothers' Day approaches.  Luis and his wife want to be ready to rotate their stock for Mothers' Day and that is precisely why their Kiva loan will prove to be a succesful investment.

Using these materials, he and his son-in-law can complete the house renovations, thus preparing a comfortable and warm place for his daughter and grandchild.
