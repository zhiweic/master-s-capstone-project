Since then, Phyllis has been in photography for 15 years. \u201cI decided to take that hobby and turn it into a career,\u201d she says. Phyllis, age 45, with a Bachelor in Marketing, returned to school to complete her degree in Computers and Graphic Design. While in college, Phyllis obtained two internships: one in marketing and another working on computers. The marketing internship was not for her. \u201cI would get off work and take time to photograph,\u201d she says. Soon after, Phyllis received compliments. \u201cMaybe someone is willing to pay me for this,\u201d she thought. \u201cI\u2019m going to slowly build the program.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn January, Phyllis opened \"PJE Multimedia\" in Shreveport. Phyllis plans to assist other local businesses with creating and assembling their websites. Another aspect of Phyllis\u2019 work is her ability to manipulate a photo to please clients. For example, she photographed an elementary class and, for one parent, Phyllis swapped her child, who was standing on the end, with the child who was standing front and center. However, Phyllis says she wants to focus more on web design and graphics until she can fully develop her photography business plan. When she photographs, Phyllis tries to capture the essence of her subject. \u201cThe purpose is to portray the photos as art,\u201d she says. Phyllis advises her customers: \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind, and if I can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter attending a lecture on small business administration at Louisiana State University, Phyllis inquired about a loan from ACCION Texas Inc. instead of a traditional bank. Recently approved, she will use the loan to purchase a lighting kit which includes lights, a green screen background and a small black background for torso and head shots. The loan will also fund product research. Phyllis plans to work with another company to print her photos on shirts but she needs to know the shirts won\u2019t wither after a couple of washes. \u201cIf a company is not up to par, I\u2019ll switch companies,\u201d she says. At the moment, Phyllis does not employ anyone else but she plans to contract a model to be on-call and pose in the shirts with her photos on them.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I have to make a quarter,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to make a picture and approach a client \u2026. The money is nice, but the emotional reaction from clients is better.\u201d For more information about PJE Multimedia, visit her website at: <a

non-traditional shoppers, Mirella, 55, opened <i>It\u2019s New To Me<\/i>, a women\u2019s clothing store, on April 28. The shop is located on a main street, 30 blocks outside downtown Laredo, Texas. At <i>It\u2019s New to Me<\/i>, Mirella sells dresses, jewelry, purses, some shoes, candles and other accessories. Though she currently sells women\u2019s apparel, Mirella plans to expand and sell new and gently-used furniture. She also plans to open a small snack shop within her store to enhance the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nMirella wanted to be her own boss, which influenced her to become an entrepreneur. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for someone else all my life,\u201d she says. Her cousin owns a furniture resale shop in Corpus Christi, Texas and inspired Mirella to do the same. As she moves out of her current location (which requires all vendors to sell new items), Mirella plans to obtain furniture to sell. Mirella\u2019s cousin was also the person who informed her about Accion Texas Inc., which saved a trip to a traditional bank. \r\n\r\nUpon approval of the loan, Mirella purchased inventory for the store. The combination of the loan and her savings paid for business cards, a 13-week ad in Laredo\u2019s <i>Bargain Book<\/i>, a new sign, rent, fire department and other necessary permits, and part of the deposit.  She says the loan will also help her buy the initial merchandise she needs.\r\n\r\nMirella currently employs her daughter-in-law and does not plan to hire more employees until her business flourishes. She plans to re-invest her earnings into the growth of <i>It\u2019s New to Me<\/i> and have a Grand Opening party in the near future to notify the community of her store.

In order to continue developing her business, Azimkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to expand the range of her products.

They live in a rented house in the district of San Pedro de Cajas \u2013 Tarma.\r\n\r\nShe has been through some difficult times. One of them was the separation from her husband. Now she is feeling better and with more motivation to work for her children. She makes weavings by hand on looms. She has been doing this work for more than 10 years. During this time she learned better strategies to sell her products more quickly. One of them is the uniqueness of her designs and the variety of the items that she makes, such as pullover sweaters, ponchos, gloves, hats, and shawls. She makes them with different qualities of wool. She also makes blankets, which is what earns her the greatest income. \u201cI make 5 blankets per month and I sell them for use in Cerro de Pasco (a city with a very cold climate),\u201d she explains. But to do this, she has to invest $35.00 per kilo of alpaca wool. \r\n\r\nThanks to her characteristic optimism, she can sell her products for use in cities like Lima, Huancayo, and Ayacucho. In this way she is able to provide her children with a decent quality of life. And, since she isn\u2019t a woman who just conforms to her situation, she also works in agriculture. She plants potatoes and high-quality maca [a traditional food and medicinal plant], since the soil in her area is rich in minerals.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she says she will be punctual with her monthly repayments. She likes the other members of her communal bank, \u201cMujeres al Futuro,\u201d because they are responsible and support one another.\r\n\r\nElvia will use the requested money to buy several kilograms of alpaca wool to make pullover sweaters, shawls, and blankets. She will also buy skeins of synthetic wool to make other items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1086779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T03:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T03:00:06Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1058.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187836,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T07:37:20Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":425044,"name":"Loma Alta Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO LOMA ALTA ES UN GRUPO SOLIDARIO DE CREDITUYO, SON 6 INTEGRANTES SUS NOMBRES SON ANA, BLANCA,EDITH, LAURA,RUTH Y THELMA.

They have four children who are in school.  They live in their own home in the indigenous community of Santa Rosa de Ubiriki in Chanchamayo.\r\n<p>\r\nAt a young age, Pablo worked on his parents' farmland and learned the trade in this manner.  He now utilizes his experience to support his family.  Pablo has a plot of land on which he grows cassava, citrus fruits, bananas, and annatto.  \"All of these products are profitable, but only if you know how to negotiate,\" says Pablo.  Last year he harvested 8,000 kilos of annatto, each kilo selling for 5 PEN.  He generated good earnings, which enabled him to continue planting.  Pablo earns extra income for his daily expenses by working as a laborer on other farms.  A large portion of his production is sold at the fruit markets in neighboring cities.  When the buyers from different cities arrive, he gets paid a fair price for his harvest.  One of his future goals is to acquire more land so that he can expand his annatto and cassava crops.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his eighth loan with MFP and Pablo gives his word that he will be punctual with his loan payments.  In addition, he is pleased that the members of his Communal Bank,  \"Las Rositas de Ubiriki\" (The Little Roses of Ubiriki), are responsible.  With this loan, Pablo will pay his workers to clear his land of weeds that could affect the normal growth of his plants.

She has full confidence that with her work and with help from God and this institution she will reach her dream of giving her family better living conditions that are different from the ones they have now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1092605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":65.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98,"local_amount":98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049668,"comment":null},{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":50.87,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":50.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521305,"comment":null},{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":57.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":57.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349738,"comment":null},{"amount":107.25,"local_amount":107.25,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321106,"comment":null},{"amount":59.74,"local_amount":59.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":59.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929682,"comment":null},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":132.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":132.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339845983,"comment":null},{"amount":58.77,"local_amount":58.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":58.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347003904,"comment":null},{"amount":64.99,"local_amount":64.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":64.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447276,"comment":null},{"amount":70.23,"local_amount":70.23,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":70.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450533,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-17T16:08:41Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:06:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428276,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisa is a farmer from San Miguel, Bohol.

Ana es una mujer ejemplar la cual cada d\u00eda se levanta muy temprano para poder cumplir con sus tareas del hogar y luego salir a hacer su recorrido en las diferentes \u00e1reas de la zona donde habita para ofrecer sus productos. Trabaja muy duro ya que siempre est\u00e1 pensando en la forma de colaborar con la econom\u00eda del hogar ya que los ingresos de su esposo no son suficientes para cubrir todas las necesidades del hogar que cada vez son mayores.

Ana is an exemplary woman who rises very early every day to do her household chores and then go out to various areas around where she lives offering her products.  She works very hard and is always thinking of ways to help with the family economy since her husband\u2019s income is insufficient to cover all household expenses which are higher every day.  It\u2019s worth stressing that her husband works as a bricklayer and often is out of work because he has to wait for projects to happen that he can offer his services to so he does not have steady income.\r\n\r\nFor Ana, the most important thing is that her family we well and able to enjoy better conditions than she\u2019s had.  All of this compels her to work very hard and to find ways to make her business grow.  Based on the above, she\u2019s made the decision to ask INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in the business buying a variety of clothes like blouses, skirts, dresses, pants and other items to attract more customers and meet their needs.  She trusts that based on this decision she will succeed in increasing profits and be able to improve her and her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1092625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.18,"local_amount":79.18,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319369,"comment":null},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":82.51,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049672,"comment":null},{"amount":82.16,"local_amount":82.16,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":82.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521309,"comment":null},{"amount":84.76,"local_amount":84.76,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329927,"comment":null},{"amount":171.39,"local_amount":171.39,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":171.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349741,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T02:00:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428281,"name":"Gabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gabina is a widow from San Miguel, Bohol.

lives with her partner and their children who help them with household expenses. Maria sells tortillas and is very well known because she sells the most delicious hot tortillas in the area. Her business is located near a high school, which means she has a lot of customers since the student's parents have them bring tortillas home after school to complement their meals. She makes everything with good quality ingredients and sells it at an affordable price. In addition, the service is quick. \r\n\r\nHer daily profits are good but she knows that they could increase if she invested a little more in ingredients. Maria is a hardworking woman and always takes advantage of opportunities that present themselves. She thinks that, in her life, she hasn't had any problems, only millions of challenges. \r\n\r\nGrowing her business is her biggest goal, and for that reason she has asked INTEGRAL for a loan to buy corn in bulk, propane, oil, etc. Maria is sure that, as with previous loans, she will be able to make all her payments. She also has faith that with hard work she will be able to give her family a better quality of

She has a store where she sells basic needs products like rice, beans, bread, eggs, and soap, among others.  This business is located in her house, and it is through the business that she supports her household.  \r\n\r\nThe store is very well-known in the area; it is the best stocked store in the area.  Her customers find everything they need.  Her products are the best quality, and the prices are quite accessible.  Like all good merchants, Yolanda always has good earnings at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nHowever, she needs to invest more in order for her business to prosper.  She is a very hard-working woman with great expectations for the future.  She thinks that self-confidence is the key to achieving those objectives.  She has decided to request a loan from Integral.  The loan will allow her to buy basic grains, instant products, bread, candy, condiments, and soap.  These are the products that are most in demand, and she does not have them or her inventory is very small.\r\n\r\nYolanda is sure that her business has the liquidity to pay for any financial responsibility.  At the same time, she has faith that she will be able to give her family a life with better opportunities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1093218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives with Filemon, who is 35 years old, in a rented house together with their three children, who are the inspiration for their hard work.\r\n \r\nFor 14 years she has worked in agriculture. She and her husband get up very early to go to the small farm where they produce cocoa, which is the product that generates the most income to support her family. \r\n\r\nHer favourite thing about working is really dedicating herself to what she is doing, since in this way she can increase her harvests. The thing she finds most difficult about her work is carrying the sacks from harvest from the farm to the town. \r\n\r\nHer future plans are to have a grocery store, but at the moment she hopes to maintain her crops fertile. This is her third loan with MFP. In her communal bank she feels happy working with people who support her and share their experiences.

She also aspires to purchase an ox plow from the additional profits from this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1099584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Likoni","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":203,"posted_date":"2012-05-20T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-19T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loise  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10650,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":761},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":757}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":6.35,"local_amount":451.09,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":535.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287632798,"comment":null},{"amount":4.58,"local_amount":325.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":386.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294404869,"comment":null},{"amount":2.62,"local_amount":186.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":221.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301459304,"comment":null},{"amount":47.85,"local_amount":3397.02,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4033.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308454320,"comment":null},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":3384.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315658977,"comment":null},{"amount":40.93,"local_amount":2905.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3449.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323055735,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-21T00:05:01Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:31:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428337,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is a resident of Likoni, Kenya.

Her husband and one of her sons make a living through brick laying.  Her other children are in school.  They want to better themselves and become professionals.  Her oldest son helps Ana with her bakery business that is located in her home.  This is how she manages to provide the daily bread for her home given that apart from her husband's income and the income she makes from her business, she doesn't have another source of income.

She is very well-known in the area as a hard-working, responsible, and honorable person.  Thanks to her charisma and good service, she has been able to establish some fixed customers who prefer her more every day.  Her wish is to be able to maintain her business for a long time to continue contributing to her family's income.

Ruth ha emprendido su negocio con una peque\u00f1a tienda instalada en su hogar, mientras su hermano es empleado de autos. Los deseos de lograr superarse econ\u00f3micamente para obtener mejores condiciones de vida, hicieron que Ruth iniciara vendiendo productos de limpieza e higiene, granos b\u00e1sicos, golosinas y otros alimentos de bajo costo que son adquiridos por sus vecinos y personas con acceso cercano a la tienda. La tienda es atendida por Ruth principalmente, pero tambi\u00e9n su hermano, al regresar cada tarde del trabajo, se ocupa de la atenci\u00f3n de los clientes que visitan la tienda, ya que es un esfuerzo familiar por mantener una fuente de ingresos tan importante para los dos. Debido al carisma y motivaci\u00f3n, de Ruth y su hermano, la tienda se mantiene funcionando pero necesitan acceder a un pr\u00e9stamo que les permita adquirir productos para la venta como: frijoles, az\u00facar, huevos, arroz, detergentes y otros bienes de primera necesidad para la tienda y as\u00ed ser un negocio que ofrezca mayor atractivos para los clientes, por contar con m\u00e1s variedad de productos para la venta.  De esta forma espera darle estabilidad al negocio e incrementar sus ingresos que le permitir\u00e1n accesar a mejores condiciones de vida para ella y su hermano.\n","en":"Ruth Lily is 31 years old and lives in a family house with her 21 year old brother. Ruth launched her business with a small shop in their home while her brother is an auto employee. Driven by the desire to get ahead economically to achieve a better quality of life, Ruth began selling cleaning and hygiene products, basic grains, candies, and other low-cost foods. These products are purchased by their neighbors and others who have close access to the store.\r\n\r\nRuth is the primary attendant in the store but her brother also helps the customers each afternoon when he returns from work. The store is a family effort to maintain a source of income that is so important for the two of them. \r\n\r\nThe store continues to run thanks to the charisma and motivation of Ruth and her brother, but they need a loan that will allow them to acquire more products to sell, such as beans, sugar, eggs, rice, detergents, and other essential goods. The business will offer more attractions to the customers and will have a greater variety of products for sale. In this way, Ruth hopes to give more stability to the business and increase their income, which will allow the two of them to improve their quality of life.

She is a single parent, brining up three children on her own. For 15 years, Jiparkul has been raising livestock, having launched this business with a starting capital of 20,000 KGS. Thanks to Jiparkul's hard work, her farm at present includes one cow, one horse, eight goats and eight sheep. Sales of milk and dairy products bring about 18,000 KGS monthly. In order to develop her business further, Jiparkul has turned to \"Bai Tushum& Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS in order to buy additional farm animals for fattening.

When he is working his wife tends to the business; they support each other in order to improve their living conditions. His son, who is studying, is his biggest inspiration to keep giving them the best so that some day he can be a professional with better opportunities than his parents had. This has motivated him to look for the best way to improve his business, as his son's needs grow and they want to have the money to give him the help that he needs. \r\n\r\nFor that reason he asks INTEGRAL for a loan to buy coconuts in bulk to meet the increased demand that will allow him to improve his profits, and thereby his quality of life.

He makes a living growing basic grains like corn and sorghum. It is worth mentioning that not only does he grow the basic grains, but he also sells the products after the harvest at the main markets in his area. He has 10 years of experience in this activity, so he has gained a lot of knowledge about the trade.

43, lives with her partner and two children. She is a fifth grade teacher, but she has also been working as a moneylender for the past year. Greta gives small loans to other people in her community, such as friends and neighbors who need emergency funds or who are investing in machinery. Greta makes a profit by charging interest on the loans. \r\n\r\nA loan will help Greta continue her business of loaning capital to those who may not otherwise have access to financial services.

She is 26 years old and a high school graduate.  Carmen has a grocery store that she started in August 2011.  She took the initiative to start this business because she likes being independent and there were no other stores in her area.  However, she only had a small amount of capital to invest.  At the moment, her store has gained acceptance since it is stocked.  Carmen works Monday through Saturday from 7am to 11pm with the help of a niece.

She lives in her own home with her family in the western part of the country in a rural area. She works in agriculture, mainly growing corn and millet. She has been doing this activity for many years and it has permitted her to meet the daily expenses of the home. This is her main source of income as she knows no other way of earning an honest wage. She sells part of her harvest in the major markets of the area where she lives and she saves a part for consumption by her family as you can see in the photo.
