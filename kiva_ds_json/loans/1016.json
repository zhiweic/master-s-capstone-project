She is the mother of three children, two of whom are dependent on her. Ing earns her living by farming rice, and by working for others as a paid laborer. Each day, she is able to earn around 24,000 KHR and save approximately 7,500 KHR after deducting the cost of living. \r\n\r\nThis will be Ing\u2019s second time requesting a loan via VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The first loan that she obtained, and successfully paid back, helped her to better support her family\u2019s living standard. Ing is leading a group member who is borrowing through VisionFund for the first time,  to take out a loan in the amount of 186,000 KHR, each person.

He lives in a very old house, built by his own father. \r\n\r\nTogboy is married and raising six children.  Since his wife is a homemaker, he is the sole breadwinner in the family.  His children, who are high school students, always ask their parents to repair their house, but Togboy's salary is not sufficient to perform those repairs.\r\n\r\nTogboy has been buying and selling food products for a few years.  He has his own booth at the local market and his own clientele.  The salary he derives from this business is enough to provide his family with food and inexpensive clothing, but not to repair his house.  He needs to repair every room, as well as the kitchen and the exterior front wall of his house.  To this end, he is requesting a loan of 2,000 somoni to purchase building materials. \r\n\r\nTogboy promises to repay his loan on time.  He and his children are counting on the help of kind lenders to help them solve their housing situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1252846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building materials to repair his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Pendjikent","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-12T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-11T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Togboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":138.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":146.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":153.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":162.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":174.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":178.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":183.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":194.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.28,"local_amount":302.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":306.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740904,"comment":null},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":159.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":161.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056208,"comment":null},{"amount":28.41,"local_amount":133.71,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510151,"comment":null},{"amount":35.46,"local_amount":166.87,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915439,"comment":null},{"amount":34.53,"local_amount":162.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693146,"comment":null},{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":170.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":172.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555958,"comment":null},{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":170.61,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":172.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549822,"comment":null},{"amount":38.28,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":182.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410958798,"comment":null},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":183.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":186.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420074967,"comment":null},{"amount":78.53,"local_amount":369.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":374.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T05:36:11Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T09:55:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":506553,"name":"Lilibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilibeth is from Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte in the Philippines.

He is married and is raising 4 children.  His wife, Nasiba, is a very smart and kind woman.  Bahodur is happy that he has such a good wife.  The children are not yet able to help the parents support the family.  Therefore, Bahodur is the main provider in the family.  He tries with all his might to provide the family with all the necessary resources.  He has been working as an electrician for more then 6 years.  He provides electrical services to local residents and earns an income this way.  His house is already old and he needs to repair all the rooms, starting with the entryway and continuing on to the children's room and kitchen.  His house is not winterized and he needs a loan of 2000 somoni for the purchase of building materials.  He promises to pay back the loan on time.  Bahodur and his children will wait until kind creditors help them to solve their housing problems.

These hard working Tribal women live in a small village on the outskirts of Senapati district in Manipur State located in the Northeastern part of India. This part of the state still lacks developmental programs, which is why these women came together as a group in 2008 to help one another to take a loan.\r\n\r\nNengneilam is the group leader. She is pictured with her hand raised. She is 39 years old and a mother to four sons and a daughter. All her children go to a private school nearby. Her husband's main source of income comes from cutting wood, which is a time-consuming process to turn into money. In order to supplement the family income, she took a loan to bridge the gap of cash flow by undertaking income-generating activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2008, she bought 3,000 pineapple saplings to grow at her farm. It takes three to four months time to harvest. With the sale profits, she was able to repay her loan and attend to the family needs such as the children's schooling fees and needs. With her second loan, she managed to cultivate on a larger scale. She purchased more pineapple saplings to increase her production. Effortlessly, she met her loan liability and with the profit, she, along with her husband's help, built a new house to live in, which is under construction. Together with her husband, she plans to provide a good education to the children.\r\n\r\nAt first, her husband was indifferent to her taking a loan. Now she is very happy that with the success that she had, her husband is willing to support her in sharing the loan responsibility. She is all the more excited that her husband actually suggested that he take the responsibility of tending the farm for her next cultivation. \r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue with pineapple cultivation. She will use the loan to buy more pineapple saplings to cultivate. She hopes that she enjoys a good harvest like the previous harvest and with the profit to spare, she means to finish building her house, which is half done.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed another loan to continue to benefit from their respective income activities. Pineapple cultivation comprises most of the activities of this group. One member has a piggery and another member opened a general store to generate income.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1252914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase pineapple saplings to cultivate and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chinchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veitin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T01:52:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":506854,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 66 a\u00f1os de edad es madre de 9 hijos en las edades e 24 a 36 a\u00f1os; ella se dedica a la venta de carne de res, v\u00edsceras, especialmente los fines de semana y desde hace 32 a\u00f1os, cuando inici\u00f3 este negocio con el fin de apoyar es sustento de su hogar y solventar los gastos familiares.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the Sahei group, which consists of eight members and was formed in 2008. They all belong to the Tribal community and hail from a small village located on the outskirts of Sadar Hills in Manipur State in the northeastern part of India. They came together as a group to help one another to take a loan.\r\n\r\nLhaingah, pictured with her hand raised, is the profile representative of the group. Since 1996, she has been living a widow's life. She is a mother to three sons and a daughter. All by herself, she shoulders parentat responsibilities trying to educate the children. She is very happy that now the two older children are on the verge of completing their graduation and the younger two are still pursuing their intermediate grade. She had done farming activities on rented land before her loan. Usually she would labor as a wage earner for extra income. In order to have a break, she abandoned the rented land to avoid paying high revenue to the landowners while she sweats.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 with her first loan, she bought two piglets to raise. In order to repay her loan, she sold one pig after four months to meet her loan liability. At the end of the year, the full grown other pig gave her a good income. With her second loan, she increased her production by raising four piglets. All her children help her by gathering waste food house to house for the pigs on a daily basis. From the sale proceeds of one pig, she bought pineapple saplings to grow in her homestead garden to sell at the market. In this way, she has been struggling to keep up and manage her children's education.\r\n\r\nShe always wanted to renovate her house's thatch roof to weather condition tin sheets and she has been saving but as usual, the savings will be used for the children's needs. She plans to execute her tin roof plans the following year, provided she is in good enough health to raise more piglets. Now she needs another loan to continue her piggery activities for better fortune. She will use the loan to buy at least four more piglets (preferably two female piglets for reproduction) to raise for profit. She also means to use part of the loan to buy new clothing for her younger children for the Christmas celebration. \r\n   \r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too need another loan to supplement their income activities. Pineapple farming, poultry farming, vegetable farming and vegetable selling are the preferable activities that the group is engaged in. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1253874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglets to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-13T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-12T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lhaingah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahchong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-14T14:05:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":506593,"name":"Katiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Katiba is 42 years old.

In 1989, as she was searching for a new source of income for her family, Aptakan began her own animal husbandry business with 5,000 som. Thanks to persistence and perseverance, she now has two horses, one cow, two calves, and five sheep for trade. Her monthly profit is about 8,000 som. \r\n\r\nWith long-term business development in mind, Aptakan turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 70,000 som loan that will help her expand her farm by purchasing cows together with their calves.

is 64 years old and lives in Artamet village, in the Armavir region of Armenia, with his wife. Both of them are of retirement age. Usub is involved in cattle breeding and he keeps ten cows and 300 lambs. His wife uses the milk they produce in cheese production and Usub sells it in the local market. Additionally, he provides beef to local butchers.

In spite of working full time, she takes care of all the housework and makes sure that she can fulfill all of her children's needs. All of the income which comes from her tailoring business goes to the household expenses, on account of which she is unable to save any amount for her children\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nShazia, as a member of this three-person borrowing group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase fabric and a sewing machine for her tailoring business. (Currently, she has only one sewing machine, which she uses for personal use as well as for her tailoring business.) This loan will help her to increase her net income.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have his photo published online, so his son appears in his Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nGhaleb is a 57-year-old married man, a father to three sons and two daughters. He is employed and earns a small salary that is not enough to cover the family's needs. Ghaleb's son is a university student specializing in Engineering who wants to complete his studies, so Ghaleb is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help his son cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop. This will help Ghaleb's son to do his homework and reports and help him in his studies. This will ensure a better future for Ghaleb's son and improve the family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

de 67 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en un municipio muy cercano a la ciudad de Barranquilla, donde tiene un negocio desde el a\u00f1o 1997, el cual inici\u00f3 al recibir su liquidaci\u00f3n, despu\u00e9s de haber sido empleado de una empresa. Inicialmente vendi\u00f3 frutas, por unidades, y fue agregando queso, carne, de cerdo, suero, mantequilla y tub\u00e9rculos varios, como hoy lo hace. Sus ventas las realiza de contado de lunes a domingo, desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta 5 de la tarde. Carlos compra a proveedores de grandes abastos de contado. Aunque su negocio poco a poco ha ido creciendo, el volumen de compras que puede hacer, aun no es suficiente para satisfacer la demanda, pues tiene el gran desaf\u00edo de no contar con el capital de trabajo requerido para comprar en mayor cantidad, lo cual le permitir\u00eda lograr precios mas competitivos y responder a su potencial clientela, especialmente en la temporada que se acerca, la navidad y el recibimiento del a\u00f1o nuevo, donde el consumo de alimentos se incrementa y Carlos justamente vende lo que usualmente en su mercado, los clientes usan como insumos para hacer el delicioso sancocho trif\u00e1sico, un caldo, en el que se hierven o cuecen con tres tipos de, carnes de cerdo, res y gallina yuca, pl\u00e1tano, \u00f1ame, ahuyama, verduras,  y que es usual en las fiestas, para ser consumidas despu\u00e9s de tomar licores que causan  la resaca del siguiente d\u00eda. En la actualidad Carlos est\u00e1 aplicando al segundo financiamiento que hace a \u00e9l, la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual logr\u00f3 tener m\u00e1s capital de trabajo, para aumentar sus inventarios y as\u00ed mismo su clientela. Hoy est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer cedikiva, para comprar en mayor volumen, carnes de cerdo, res y gallina yuca, pl\u00e1tano, \u00f1ame, ahuyama, verduras y hacer su mejor venta, en la \u00e9poca que se aproxima, por lo cual espera convertirlo en una inversi\u00f3n exitosa.\n\n","en":"Carlos is 67 years old and lives in a community very near Barranquilla, where he has had a business since 1997.  He began it after he lost his job at another company.  At first he sold individual fruit but then added cheese, meat, whey, butter, and various types of tubers.  He sells for cash, Monday through Friday from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm and buys his wares for cash from large suppliers.  Even though his business has been growing little by little in size, the volume of goods that he can buy is not sufficient to satisfy the demand.  He has the great challenge of not having the working capital he needs to make purchases in quantity, which would provide him with more competitive prices and allow him to respond to potential customers, especially during the holiday season, when the consumption of food increases.\r\n\r\nCarlos sells what he usually sells in his market.  Customers buy ingredients to make delicious soup that they boil and add three types of meat, pork, beef, and chicken; plantain, smoked yam, and vegetables.  It\u2019s eaten at parties after drinking liquor.\r\n\r\nCarlos is asking for another loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that he will use to increase his working capital and investments and number of customers.  He is using his first Kiva loan to buy pork, beef, chicken, yucca, plantains, etc. in bulk to improve his sales for the coming season.  He expects this to be a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1246663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

In addition, her daughter works as a teacher at the local school, and her son is a soldier. Both of them get monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nMarine requested a loan for starting up a trading business. Her loan requests were rejected each time, because she did not meet income requirements and she lacks experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. But Marine\u2019s loan request was approved by Credo, as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups and re-startups. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marine will cover the costs of purchasing her initial inventory of basic groceries, for starting a grocery store. She plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Marine will work hard, and she will be able to improve the living conditions for her family. With this loan, her family will generate enough income to access regular, available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event they need it in the

His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family's poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is a small agricultural business. They have a milk cow and 2 calves. The family produces cheese and sells locally. Their income is hardly enough for food for a four member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGocha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business and build a greenhouse. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Gocha will purchase all the building materials for the greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built properly, Gocha will grow greens and tomatoes. The harvested products will be sold for a good price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the family income and all members will improve their living conditions.

Judith's group is comprised of three hardworking women. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Judith has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to buy more fashionable clothes to sell; this will help her to generate greater profits, pay for her medical expenses, and buy new clothes for herself. Judith hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. <p>\r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1254185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1247056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which has a high regional output of maize. She has seven children. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business. She has been doing this work for 15 years.\r\n\r\nJustine stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Poultry keeping and dairy farming!\" Her biggest challenges are animal diseases and expensive animal feed. Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Seroi' and 'Lelmet.' \r\n\r\nJustine will use the loan of 30,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nJustine was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Because it gives loans to small-scale farmers, so as to improve their lives.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"They are financial institutions that offer short-term loans.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Justine replied, \"Money from the sale of poultry and its products will enable me to pay school fees for my children.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Justine owns the following: a cow, poultry, a bicycle, and an automobile, but she does not own a pig, a pump or a motorcycle. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, a sewing machine, and a television, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1254188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

He would like to stock up on the wood he uses for his carvings, to increase production.\r\n\r\nGusti has been selling through NOVICA since 2003. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I was born to a family of farmers, and I worked after school to ensure my education. We were six children, so my parents could hardly invest in our education. I also took a part-time job finishing and adding color to art products. Since school, my artwork has always been admired. After I graduated from a technical school, a friend suggested painting on a piece of wood, and the result was very nice. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have been dedicated to this art form ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks much to God and to all of you who are helping me with this micro-credit. With the money, we can buy wood and increase our production. With this, we hope sales will increase so my team can have a better income, and the daily needs of our families can be covered. It's good to help small artisans.

When I was still quite young I knew I had an ability to translate nature into artful things of beauty.

He is a father to two sons and one daughter. He is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Yaqoub has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and a good second source of income for the family. Yaqoub wants to own a taxi, to improve his earnings. Therefore he is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN, to help him cover the price of purchasing a new taxi. Owning the taxi will enable Yaqoub to work extra hours and to accept additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively. Yaqoub is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fee. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages, to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulie hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is Jennifer, 34, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Lino. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nJennifer also sells fish of different kinds and also meat. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer dreams of having children and hopes to expand her business.

Her business is located in an area of her home, in the town where she lives with her partner and her children, ages 3 to 10. \r\n\r\nShe needs to buy steel, sandpaper, welding rods and polishing disks. Her aim is to increase her output and obtain discounts by acquiring these raw materials in bulk and getting good prices. This is in order to pass them on to her customers at the end of the transaction. \r\n\r\nHer funds are insufficient to respond to the growth in her demand. This is because she sells 50% on credit and 50% for cash, and her recovery of debts is not timely enough to respond to her orders. For this reason, investing becomes a great challenge. This is why she is applying for a credikiva loan, her second with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy the necessary supplies so that she can succeed in being effective and increasing her income once again. This because the first loan enabled her to fulfill the needs of her loyal clientele, which she has built in the 24 years since she began, after having taken a course through the National Learning Service (SENA). There she learned the basic elements of ornamental iron work: designing, measuring, cutting steel, welding, polishing, painting and installing. \r\n\r\nToday in her business, she has a sales frequency of five days, buying the supplies for cash at steel distributors. With her business she is fulfilling her objective, for which her idea was born, which is to generate income to help with household expenses, responding in this way to the lack of job opportunities and to the support she has received from her uncles. They were the ones who supplied her with her first working capital, so that someday she could get ahead in life, which remains the goal she still dreams of."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1246703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy steel, sandpaper, welding rods and polishing disks.

20 years old, lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda.

For the past 3 years, Anita has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Anita has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

This compelled Yasmeen to start her own business, to contribute to the family income.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the business of sewing for many years. She is well familiar with the stitching techniques. She initiated her business with the support of Kashf Foundation; she took her first loan to buy a sewing machine. At present, she enjoys a great client list and has gained a lot of appreciation and popularity in her community.\r\n\r\nShe requested a loan of PKR 30,000 to buy more spools of thread in various colors, with packs of buttons, zippers, and related items for sewing. With these in stock, she will be able to meet the demands of her customers, without fail. She hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving a good and quality education to her children, through all her hard work in her

For the past three years, Anita has been working hard to manage her small business in clothing sales.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Anita is requesting a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale and will help Anita to generate greater profits and pay for her family's medical expenses.\r\n\r\nAnita hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nAnita is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She has two children who are 25 and 12 years old, but she lives with only the younger one.  She lives in her own house, located in a district in the central forest.  Aurelia is a conscientious and persevering woman.  \n\nFive months ago, she had the idea to start a profitable business.  She makes her living buying and selling dairy products such as:  custard, cheeses, yogurt, and others.  For this, she travels to the city of Oxapampa, where she buys her merchandise at modest prices.  \"My customers are my neighbors and friends; they are good payers and each time they place more orders,\" she comments.  Every three weeks she runs out of products and travels again.  This is routine.  \n\nThe sales are profitable.  For example, she buys a kilo of cheeses at 11 soles and sells them at 15. Her sales are better if she purchases more merchandise.  Her sales work begins in the mornings.  She fills baskets or trays with her products and goes to her customers' houses.  She likes this activity.  \n\nShe invests 1000 to 1500 soles per month purchasing her products, which is why she is asking for help to be able to continue her work with ease.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is grateful for the support she has received during this time, and says that she will be responsible with her repayments.\n\nShe belongs to the \"Luz y Verdad\" (\"Light and Truth\") community bank and likes her partners because they are supportive.

is a 38-year-old, hard-working man, living in Bundibugyo, Uganda. For 14 years he has been trading in cocoa. He was among the first people to venture into this lucrative business, and he has since reaped tangible benefits. \r\n\r\nLike most good fathers, he desires to educate his children up to the university level, and set up sustainable income-generating activities for them.

Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que le permite tener un ingreso econ\u00f3mico, lo que no le gusta es que los precios de los productos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus comidas suben de precio, y eso varia en sus ganancias. Ella sigue esforz\u00e1ndose  gracias a que su puesto es muy concurrido  teniendo todas la ganas de ampliar su negocio. Con el pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 materiales para arreglar su negocio como calaminas y listones para arreglar el techado y con el saldo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de los ingredientes necesarios para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus parrilladas.\n\n","en":"Maria is 59 years old and is a happy, dynamic, enterprising woman.  She\u2019s divorced and lives with her two adult children, ages 31 and 25, in a home of their own that she and her ex-husband built.  Maria sells food and drinks out of her home on the weekends.  She also sells at fairs in her neighborhood.  She has the support of her children and they help her prepare the food and serve customers.  She also sells soft drinks on weekdays and has a refrigerator that she bought with her savings.  What she likes about her work is that it allows her to have an income.  What she doesn\u2019t like is that the prices for her supplies go up and this affects her profits.  She continues to make an effort, thanks to the fact that her stall is well visited and she has a great desire to expand her business.  She will use the 1000 PEN from this loan to buy supplies to fix the roof at her business.  She will use the rest to buy ingredients to prepare her parrilladas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1254418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"building materials and ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-14T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-13T04:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":144.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":185.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.82,"local_amount":144.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":148.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572992,"comment":null},{"amount":60.26,"local_amount":150.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":155.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122641,"comment":null},{"amount":66.45,"local_amount":166.13,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":170.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868463,"comment":null},{"amount":69.24,"local_amount":173.09,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":178.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577292,"comment":null},{"amount":72.14,"local_amount":180.35,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":185.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529534,"comment":null},{"amount":74.09,"local_amount":185.23,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":190.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974598,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-19T00:33:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":507480,"name":"Damacia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.
