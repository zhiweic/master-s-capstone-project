At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAnnabelle oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. They own one tricycle, a motorcyle plus sidecar, that carries up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a bounty (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 every day.\r\n\r\n To help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and accessories and also for the maintenance of their motorcycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnnabelle dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of their work.

I would like to introduce you to the Aguilas Group which is made up of ten members, the majority of whom know each other and have participated in the group for about six years. \r\n\r\nHilda is one of the members. She is 48 years old, separated from her husband, and has two children. She sells food, a business she began with help from her sister-in-law who encouraged her to work with her. They both used to deliver breakfasts to workers in various places. However, her sister-in-law became ill and left the business to Hilda. Currently Hilda runs it with help from her eldest daughter. They get up very early to take the food to their customers, most of whom work in a nearby shopping mall or offices. They serve juices, teas, quinua, and different types of sandwiches.\r\n\r\nAs the work is very hard, Hilda would like to have a permanent stall close to the place where they deliver the breakfasts. That way she wouldn\u2019t have travel expenses and wouldn\u2019t have to transport so much heavy food from her house.\r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s income provides money for household expenses and also her children\u2019s education. With the loan she will be able to buy a refrigerator which will be a great help as it will allow her to keep the food cold. \r\n\r\nHilda is very grateful for your help.

Eight years ago she was widowed and had to assume the responsibilities of her household alone. Thanks to her efforts she was able to educate her children and has one who is in the university. She is a hardworking woman who knew how to move her children ahead with the income she earned by selling groceries, which is her principal business. She also works in the orchard in her community in the afternoons. She will use the loan to purchase the merchandise she will sell in her small store, such as rice, sugar, milk, noodles, etc.\r\n\r\nClotilde is very happy because people who are not from her country are very interested in her story and in the dreams that each one of the members of her group has. For that she wants to thank each one of the members of Kiva and the team at Edaprospo for collaborating in her progress.\r\n\r\nClotilde is the first person from the left in the photo.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa. Fe Mira hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is a 45-year-old married woman who has been residing in the Baray district of Kompong Tom province. She and her spouse help each other in handling their farming business on their inherited farmland. They have been in this occupation for almost seven years old, typically earning approximately 2.40 USD per day. Most of their profit goes for sustenance, clothing and other allowances for their children. This couple has given birth to six children, all of whom are still single and living together with them under the same roof. Currently, her two oldest sons are working in the construction industry to help the family financially. For additional income, Khek also operates a small store from her home where she sells many types of grocery items. \r\n\r\nKhek would like to increase the stock of merchandise to sell in her store in order to satisfy her customers living in her community. But due to the shortage of funds, she is asking for a loan of 1,200 USD to purchase beverages, snack foods, sweets, canned items, noodles, spices, and other miscellaneous household thing items. With any remaining funds, she will purchase a few sacks of chemical fertilizers for her rice crops. She believes that this loan will have a positive impact on her business as well as her living

She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLucila dreams to grow her business in the coming years. She hopes to give a good future to her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1171396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nClarita hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Consequently, he has some children and an accommodating wife, who always helps in maintaining the business.

is Nancy. She previously accessed a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help with their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNancy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Norietta's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorietta hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

I am writing today but first I want to renew an indication of the display of affection and special consideration of all Peruvians.\r\n\r\nToday we speak of the group \u201cLa Cantuta,\u201d a group that is beginning its second cycle. It is a large group that consists of eleven members.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Patricia, one of the youngest. She is 20 years old, single, and lives with her mother and younger siblings and is pursuing university studies in management.\r\n\r\nShe decided to open a grocery store thanks to the advice of her mother about two years ago. Previously she worked preparing food (restaurant) as were some of her siblings, but the income was not sufficient to maintain all of them. So Patricia became independent and she pays for her studies with  the money she earns from her grocery store. She likes the business because she interacts with customers and has made many friends. Her dream is to be able to complete her studies, and to open another store so she can help her siblings. She will use the money from this loan to buy merchandise such as rice, sugar, soft drinks, beans, cereals, and more.\r\n\r\nA big thank you, is what Patricia says for the help that is offered. The photograph of Patricia is located at the bottom, the first from the left, and she is wearing a plaid jacket.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":1170066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft drinks, cereal, beans, rice, sugar, and other supplies for her grocery store to earn money which pays for her university studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-09-03T14:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-03T14:40:01Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrica Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michelle Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex Jhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar Marino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy Lily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Willians","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eladio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jacinta Secilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betsabe Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1016.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1016.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1016.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1016.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1016.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1016.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":783.34,"local_amount":2033.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308131506,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":1016.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367406,"comment":null},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1016.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322976585,"comment":null},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1016.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331113720,"comment":null},{"amount":391.66,"local_amount":1016.65,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339505270,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T09:44:49Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:55:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":461741,"name":"Sol De Vitarte Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Saludos desde Per\u00fa, les presento a un grupo entusiasta y con muchos deseos de surgir en sus negocios, as\u00ed se caracteriza la alcanc\u00eda sol de Vitarte conformado por 7 integrantes que luchan d\u00eda a d\u00eda para  cumplir sus metas.

They have a plot of land, where they grow vegetables. Sopio sells harvested products on the local open market. Their average monthly income totals 500 Laris. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \n\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start-up a trade business. She will purchase a car, take clothing and family goods from Tbilisi (capital city of the country) wholesale markets and sell them in her and nearby villages with a price mark-up. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income of the family by 200 laris and the business won\u2019t have a seasonal character. The family will be able to improve their living conditions.

He typically earns 8,000 KHR per day.\r\n\r\nHe wants to improve his farming business, which is why he is asking for a loan of 700,000 KHR to purchase fertilizers for his crop care. This will help Rath maintain a healthier rice crop, thus increasing his crop yields in harvest season. Rath will gradually grow his business towards the attainment of his goals, as he hopes to be a successful

She is a mother to her four children. She, together with her children, manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagros operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMilagros hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

is Anabelle, 49, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Alberto, a vendor, and mother to her six children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnabelle operates a coconut and banana stand. She buys coconut fruit that are native to the Philippines, which are grown mostly in the southern region of Luzon. She also sells bananas. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. To help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more coconuts to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nAnabelle dreams to grow her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1179968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

His father works as a vice-president at a private company, while his mother takes care of the household. The family has one other son who works as a sales manager in a private firm. \r\n\r\nAlisher's parents are unable to pay for his education this year.

is Elsa, 39, resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rogelio, a salesman, and is the mother of one child. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes to grow her business and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Felix who works abroad. She is a mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNenita operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNenita hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

She is married to Michael, a baker's helper, and a mother to her child. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nLourdeliza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLourdeliza hopes to grow her business and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business.
