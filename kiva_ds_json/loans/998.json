is Maria. She is 48, and a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Santiago, who works abroad, and a mother to her children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them with a little profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 45,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise like jackets, polo, shirts and other products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMaria hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to have a good life.

Sarojin is 47 years old and is staying with her husband and her two children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing paddy cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighbourhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took on leadership of the group and started to cultivate paddy and sell them in her village. She has very good relationships with her customers as she sells paddy or rice, whichever is required by the customers, on time.

aged 50, is a resident of Bacoor, Philippines and is the mother of her children. She manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to pay her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, etc. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then delivered to the customer with one-month's credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, which is how profits are earned by the dealers who invest in this way to earn their income. Elizabeth's  regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, Elizabeth is requesting a loan of  50,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, undergarments, etc. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of her family having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1239707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

aged 51, is a resident of Tondo, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother to her children. She and her children manage their household while she operates her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nCynthia operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only the usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two people when buying cooked rice and food costs less than raw ingredients. \r\n\r\nCynthia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Cynthia to continue operating her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCynthia hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1239732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is an area with high poultry production and consumption. He has seven children and has been doing this work for 10 years.  His primary income sources are milk, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Feeding dairy cows to improve their productivity!' His biggest challenge is 'High cost of animal feeds and diseases..' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Lelmet'. He says he will use the loan requested, amounting to 41,600 from Juhudi Kilimo, to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nPatrick was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Because I am a farmer and Juhudi Kilimo offers loans to small-scale farmers to boost their farming activities.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Micro finance is short-term loans given to people who do small-scale farming and businesses.'\r\n\r\nPatrick's highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Patrick replied, 'My children will go to school due to the money from selling milk.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Patrick owns the following: 'cow, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

34-year-old Lamin from Waterloo in the western rural area of Sierra Leone. He is married with two children between the ages of two and five years old. One of his children is currently attending school. In 2000, Lamin established his local foodstuff business within a busy market area. He began his business because he came from an extended family and he has no one to support him. He works at the business from 7:00 am until 8:30 pm, 7 days per week. He says that the main challenge to his business is insufficient capital to run his business.\n\nLamin requires a loan in order to buy beans, palm oil, pepper and groundnuts. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to increase his business and improve his standard of living. In the future, Lamin plans to build a business structure of his own. The woman feature in the video is the SEP loan officer from the Waterloo branch.  He thanks you for your support.

She lives with Lucio, her husband of 17 years. They have seven children who they raised with great love, and they now live with their granddaughter in a rented house.\r\n\r\nReyna doesn't look after any of her children now, because they have all grown up, and this makes her feel proud. But she and her husband still have to work  to support themselves and raise their granddaughter without any other worries. She makes a living growing corn, potatoes and alfalfa on her own land, which she always takes good care of. During harvest time, she sells her produce in the wholesale market in the city, where she has regular customers. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, her husband receives a pension from the job he did before he retired. Over time, he saved up to buy a car, and now works as a public transport taxi driver between two nearby cities. He has obtained all the necessary licenses and he only needs one more in order to work with peace of mind. The job pays well because he uses his own car, which means he makes more profit. \r\n\r\nReyna belongs to the \"San Lorenzo\" support group, and this is their thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is hoping for a small loan which will allow her to achieve her goals. She promises to meet her loan repayments, just as she did with the last loan she received. She enjoys being part of the association because all its members are responsible and supportive. Reyna will use the money she has requested to buy organic compost to put on her crops. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1239814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":316.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":331.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":347},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":372.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":377.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":401.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":416.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":435.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":124.09,"local_amount":316.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":323.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188896,"comment":null},{"amount":129.87,"local_amount":331.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":338.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572793,"comment":null},{"amount":135.91,"local_amount":347,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":354.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122457,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":372.33,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":380.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868278,"comment":null},{"amount":148.04,"local_amount":377.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":385.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577096,"comment":null},{"amount":157.4,"local_amount":401.89,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529379,"comment":null},{"amount":163.23,"local_amount":416.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":425.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974496,"comment":null},{"amount":170.63,"local_amount":435.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":444.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995927,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T14:52:04Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":498291,"name":"Petisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petisi is 38 years old and married with 7 children.

Being surrounded by disabled veterans, as well as military mothers and the elderly, Melanie hopes to offer special yoga classes to meet these individuals\u2019 unique needs.\r\n\r\nWith her husband being gone three weeks a month, Melanie is daily overcoming the struggles of starting a business while raising her baby. Melanie\u2019s $10,000 Kiva loan will allow her to finish remodeling her studio and make the final equipment purchases to open her business.   \r\n\r\nA strong believer in the healing powers of yoga, Melanie envisions her studio as a place of healing, where troops have the ability to relieve both physical and mental pains in a comfortable and warm environment.

","en":"Tamarkan is 52 years old, she has raised six children. Tamarkan has been doing animal husbandry as a main source of income for her family, a business which she started 34 years ago with an amount of 4,000 som (KGS). Because of her hard work Tamarkan now has two cows and two young calves, six goats and her monthly profit from the business is around 10,000 KGS. Her husband and youngest son who is only one from all the children who has still not married help her to run the business.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family earns their living through an agricultural business. In particular, Susanna grows potatoes, barley and wheat on the family-owned land. The family sells the harvested products locally. Besides that, Susanna\u2019s grandmother is a pensioner.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSusanna requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provision of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Susanna will purchase calves to start an animal husbandry business.

is Melecio, 24. He is a resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. He is single and lives with his parents to help them manage their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMelecio operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nMelecio hopes to be able to expand soon. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and this is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1239870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay

to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses. \n\nDanda is one of them. The only sitting lady in the photograph is Danda. She is 32, very poor, and lives with her husband, three sons, age 15, 8 and 6, and one daughter, age 13. Her family belongs to the below poverty line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.\n \nDanda has been running a general store in her small village for seven years with the help of her husband. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, and stationery such as books, pens, etc. She was able to increase the varieties of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly cash income from the existing business is around INR 4,000. Apart from this, she also gets some income in kind as the barter system is still prevailed in rural pockets. Out of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses. \n\nAs per the statement, she was able to increase the varieties in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. So the loan amount will be used to purchase items like lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she replenishes her stock from the nearest town thrice in a week. Danda hopes to save enough money for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested.\n \nThe other four members of the group are Mamata, Saebani, Sita and Chanchala, who are running an electrical shop, a milk business, and a grocery shop.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for purchasing of lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chhatapipal, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T20:26:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496828,"name":"Madres Luchadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las mujeres del comit\u00e9 Madres luchadoras tiene 17 miembros, todas ellas madres de familia, que se esfuerzan al m\u00e1ximo por sus hijos, por salir adelante y darles todo lo que tienen para un mejor d\u00eda a d\u00eda y sin privaciones.\nLa Sra.

At this time, she is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profits by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma dreams of having a good life and hopes to expand her business through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Lasha has a bakery, where breads are baked and sold in Batumi. The income from this bakery is hardly enough to cover only food and everyday expenses for three people. Because the income is not enough for the family, Lasha decided to start-up a new business with the requested loan.\r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved in the frame of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lasha will purchase an additional local bakery, where he will bake Khachapuri (Georgian \u201ccheese bread\u2019\u2019). This is a very popular traditional food among Georgians. Khachapuri will be sold with the breads from Lasha's first bakery, and this will increase the family's income.

is Ligaya, She previously accessed an 8,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, needles, and other materials needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in her personal, household, and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 8,000 PHP loan to buy additional supplies of raw materials needed in her business. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

This is their 1st group loan.\r\nMadame GNEFILA (1st woman standing on the photo from left to right) excels in selling soap. She is much sought after in this activity.\r\nShe plans to use this loan to buy 10 bags of traditional kabakourouni soap and 3 bags of a different quality BT soap. She gets her supplies from Kimparana. She sells for cash, retail and credit to a mixed customer base.\r\nWith this loan, GNEFILA hopes to achieve an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA that she will use to reinvest in her business and help her husband in looking after the household needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1237438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kafono","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-20T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-20T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gnefila       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kasitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia S          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103146,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243428,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625018,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179913,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922716,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":51348.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636255,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T22:23:19Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497091,"name":"Elisabeth Sourou's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Il s'agit d'un groupe compos\u00e9 de deux femmes en caution solidaire.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Ofelia's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Ofelia is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nOfelia hopes to expand her business through all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her goal for the future is to have a workshop to shape the next generation of artisans that will one day export many of these products to the world with the quality necessary for the globalized market. Currently she is applying for a Kiva loan, which is her first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Through it, she will buy thread, wool, hammock fabric, and paints to make handcrafts to order. She also needs to buy supplies to sell Christmas cakes and hayacas such as flour, rice, oil, salt, vegetables, and meat products. She anticipates that her Kiva loan will be a good multipliable investment, because she will do it during one of the most commercial seasons of the year, where everything merchants and producers offer goes quickly in the market at a time when a lot of money changes hands."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1240567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase thread,

Thanks to her hard work and diligence, today her business contains one dairy cow and five sheep, sugar beats planted on her land, and the monthly income amounts to 4,000 som.  Her husband actively helps her with the business.  In order to further develop her business, Ainura requested a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow.  The cow will allow her to increase the sales of milk.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further expansion of her business.

She got married after finishing school.  To provide the primary source of income, she and her husband became involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business with 50,000 som.  Thanks to Munara's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows, two calves, five sheep, five goats and thirty cases of bee hives.  The monthly income from the business amounts to about 15,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Munara requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy young livestock for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of domestic livestock quantities in order to improve her family's financial situation.

She received her portion of the collective farm land after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  To provide the primary source of income, she became involved in animal husbandry and farming in 1998, having started this business with 10,000 som.  Thanks to Patila's hard work, today her business contains one cow and six sheep, and the monthly income from the business amounts to about 10,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Patila requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of domestic livestock quantities and business expansion.

is a 27-year-old single man. \r\nFor the past five years, Mahmoud has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for him, but also it needs more support to cover costs.\r\nMahmoud is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing some necessary spare parts for the taxi he drives, such as mirrors, lights and wheels. This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and enable Mahmoud to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve his income positively and ensure to him better future.\r\nMahmoud is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She started her business out of necessity so that she could support her children, who at that time were young and depended on her. \n\nSocorro has worked before with Fundaci\u00f3n Leon and through previous loans has shown herself to be responsible and punctual with her repayments. She needs the loan to stock up on merchandise because the Christmas season is approaching, which is when her sales increase. Having stock will allow her to meet her customers\u2019 demands. With the money from the loan, she will buy merchandise such as: pants, skirts, dresses, children\u2019s clothing, bedding items, blouses, cosmetics, and sandals. \n\nSocorro is grateful for the support that Kiva lenders provide to people of few resources in poor countries like Nicaragua, so that they can have a dignified way to work.

is 40 years old. She lives in the Telavi District of East Georgia, with her husband George, a 20-year-old son and her mother-in-law. Ekaterine\u2019s son is a student and George works as an artisan locally to earn monthly income. Ekaterine works as a saleslady and she gets a small monthly salary as well. The family income is only enough to cover food and everyday expenses.  Ekaterine has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nEkaterine requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ekaterine will purchase children\u2019s clothing and sell it from the store located at the local fair. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume.   This will increase the family's income.
