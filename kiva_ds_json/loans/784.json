When she finishes her work day she makes desserts that she distributes to some restaurants in the municipality.  Her desserts are known for their good flavor and for the good quality of service that she offers.  This is why, little by little, her sales have been increasing considerably.\r\n\r\nAs Liliana makes the desserts manually or by hand, she does not have a large production.  That is why she has not been able to take care of the large orders that some of her customers are making lately.  With the aim of being able to increase production of her desserts, Liliana is looking to buy an industrial blender.  This will allow her to make the process more industrialized, and she will be able to speed up production.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lilian does not have enough capital to buy this machine.  That is why she has the hope that a loan will give her the possibility of buying an industrial blender, which will allow her to make more desserts in less time.\r\n\r\nLiliana hopes that her income increases and that she will be able to take care of customers that she previously could not.

is 34 year old Ibrahim.  He is married and has 1 child age 3.  He has 1 additional dependent, who lives with him in order to assist in running the business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ibrahim established his mobile recharge card business.  He began his business because he did not get a job after University Studies and needed a source of income to provide a livelihood for his family.  Working 7 days a week and 15 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,300,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe needs a loan of SLL 5,000,000.

Trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 6h00 hasta las 22h00 y a veces hasta m\u00e1s tarde cuando tiene pedidos que entregar, lleva m\u00e1s de 15 a\u00f1os dedicada a esta profesi\u00f3n.\n\nNos cuenta que en el cr\u00e9dito anterior todo marcho con mucha normalidad y que le fue muy bien, en cu\u00e1nto a los pagos estuvo al d\u00eda en todos los pagos y no tuvo ninguna complicaci\u00f3n.\n\nEst\u00e1 repitiendo el cr\u00e9dito ya que todos los cr\u00e9ditos que ha recibido del banco le han ayudado mucho en su negocio y en su vida personal ya que sola ella tiene que solventar los gastos que generan sus hijos y su hogar, el cr\u00e9dito le sirvi\u00f3 para mejorar su negocio y con las ganancias que tuvo pudo cubrir ciertos gastos que generaron los estudios de su hija en la universidad, este nuevo cr\u00e9dito es para  comprar telas, hilos, botones y otros materiales para la costura. Ella es socia fundadora del Banco Comunal, es la presidenta y le gusta porque el grupo es muy unido y responsable.\n \nSus sue\u00f1os son seguir adelante en su taller de costura y que su hija sea una gran profesional.\n\n\n\n","en":"In the municipal fortress of the city of Portoviejo, the capital of Manab\u00ed, (known for many years as \"The City of the Royal Tamarind Trees\"), the members of the New Star Community Bank for Development meet every two weeks. Here we meet Se\u00f1ora Mariana. She is 55 years old, and a single mother of three children; two of them are grown and the third is an 18 year old girl who studies at the university. All her children still live at home. Several years ago she took tailoring classes in a local academy. \r\n\r\nIn order to help her children get ahead, she started a small sewing shop in her home nine years ago, where she works sewing all kinds of clothes. She works from specific orders placed by individuals who come to her shop to have their clothes made. She tells us that what she makes most is sleepwear. She works based on orders from individuals and also delivers the garments she makes to bazaars\u200b\u200b. She works every day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and sometimes even later when she has orders to deliver. She has worked in this profession for more than 15 years. \r\n\r\nShe told us that with her last loan everything went smoothly and that it turned out well. She was current on all her payments and there were no complications. She is repeating the loan because all of the loans that she has received from the bank have helped her greatly with her business and with her personal life. Since she has the responsibility to cover the costs of her home and for her children, the loan helped her to improve her business and with the profits she was able to cover certain costs associated with her daughter studying to the university. This new loan will be used to buy fabric, thread, buttons and other materials for sewing. \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and the president; she likes the group because it is very united and responsible. Her dreams are to continue moving forward with her sewing shop and that her daughter will be a great professional.

She believes that she does well in her business because she prepares her products with much cleanliness and above all because she sells fresh products and customers feel confident buying her products.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude Luz feels towards Kiva lenders in very big because with the help she\u2019s been given she will be able to buy more utensils and ingredients to make her products and with that she can improve her income to continue saving up to reach her greatest dream which is: \u201cTo give her children a profession.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":997552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy utensils and ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.36,"local_amount":67.62,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":68.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993924,"comment":null},{"amount":26.28,"local_amount":70.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":70.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601827,"comment":null},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":149.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":150.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090946,"comment":null},{"amount":267.47,"local_amount":713.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":719.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298099,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T23:10:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388840,"name":"Henry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Henry, age 57, owns and operates a shop that sells canned goods, snacks, spices, and beverages.

Before birth, his aunt owned and operated a salon that has now been in business for about 50 years. \"I've always wanted to work for myself and just kind of make my mom proud,\" he said. \"That was my goal though I began as a cook.\"\r\n\r\nJesse sensed there was a lack of knowledge and a pool of stylists attempting non-chemical treatments, so he made it top priority to go to school and change his career. Non-chemical does not mean that he does not know how to dye hair or care for chemically treated hair. His business niche is to work with such natural hair styles as dread locks, which he has been doing for 30 years, braids, corn rows, teasing, and the like. \r\n\r\nJesse had done business in Louisiana since 1996 until Hurricane Katrina devastated the state in 2005 and prompted him to re-locate to Texas. So he's especially appreciative of the lending assistance he received from ACCION Texas Inc., as he found re-starting his business in a different state was a complicated endeavor. \r\n\r\nHe employs 11 hair stylists and plans to hire more within the next year. In order to do that though, he will need a larger building in Austin's downtown. This, he said, may necessitate another loan. For the time being, Jesse is using the money to replace two styling chairs, purchase two TVs (which his clients have requested), and use the rest for marketing. The loan from ACCION Texas allows him to respond to clients' requests and recommendations. \"It's all about them,\" he said. \r\n\r\nCheck out his websites at: www.jaeundreas.net, www.jaeundreas.com

Miguel has been buying sheep and calves for more than 15 years, and he says that things are going very well with the calf sales and especially in December during Christmas celebrations. He says that in the cold months he has to be very careful with his animals because they get sick due to the heavy frosts that befall the area. Miguel says that the loan will help him since thanks to this he can buy another 2 calves, and he will increase his income a little more. With this he will be able to have a nice New Year\u2019s dinner and invite his children and grandchildren, who are his joy, to his home.

So, she started her business and her mother sends her a little bit of money that she invests in her store. The variety of clothing she carries attracts lots of customers, even more when they have many uses.

29 years old, married, and has a daughter and a son, both of preschool age. The family lives in the village Ak-Suu in the Moskovsky region. Lidiya was born and grew up in the village Belovodskoye, in a family of farmers. After graduating from high school, she entered the Pedagogical Institute in the city of Bishkek, where she became acquainted with her future husband Sergej. In 2003, when she was starting her third year, they got married. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning the couple lived in a rented apartment in Bishkek. After having finished the education, they moved to the village Belovodskoye, to Lidiya's relatives. Lidiya explains that her parents gave them a cow for the wedding, so they started their first business. Over time they started to expand their farm - Lidiya's husband became engaged in field crop cultivation, taking three hectares of irrigated land to start growing crops and alfalfa. \r\n\r\nIn the village Belovodskoye, there is a small dairy factory, which takes milk from the local population and produce products such as butter, cheese, cottage cheese, cream and so on. For over more than five years, Lidiya has cooperated with this factory and delivered milk to them. Thanks to the revenue from the milk, Lidiya and her husband expanded their business - they have now rented an additional five hectares of land, where they grow sugar beets and potatoes, which gives a good profit for the family. \r\n\r\nThanks to persistent work, Lidiya's family was able to buy a small house with a barn in the village Ak-Suu in 2007, where they keep six cows, three horses and four bulls. In order to further develop her business, Lidiya turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. In the near future, Lidiya plans to increase the revenue from selling milk, and use the income to increase the number of livestock. In the future, Lidiya plans to expand the farm, to have the opportunity to provide her children with education at a good university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1000385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":926.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":926.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":947.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":926.15,"local_amount":43000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":43372.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285482,"comment":null},{"amount":926.16,"local_amount":43000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43372.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459406,"comment":null},{"amount":947.69,"local_amount":44000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":44381.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T11:20:11Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389064,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirty-five-year-old Abraham is married to Julia and is blessed with two children aged seven and five.

years old and married. In the search of a source of income for her family, Zulpiya started her business of animal husbandry in 2000, with a starting sum of 20,000 som (KGS).

She is 29 years old, married, and she and her husband have two children, ages 6 years and 18 months.  Her husband works driving a mototaxi, but also supports her a lot in everything she does.  He is her right hand.  Victoria, as a good Peruvian, loves our food and one of the meals that she enjoys very much is the delicious \"Pollo a la Brasa\" (Peruvian roasted chicken).  She could eat this everyday without getting tired of it.  Since her parents didn't have sufficient economic means, she could only study until the fifth grade of secondary education, but she would have very much liked to study computation and information.  \r\n\r\nVictoria sells general and staple goods.  She works around 15 hours a day and attends to about 20 customers a day.  She works at this business because her mother did before her. However, they deceived her with counterfeit money and for this reason, she became discouraged and closed the business.  In time, she decided to reopen the business and through it, has saved a lot to invest in it.  She thinks that her business is going well because she is attentive to her customers, and moreover, she offers good quality products.\r\n\r\nVictoria is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since with their support, she can purchase merchandise for the school year (school supplies, uniforms, among others) and can offer them in her store.  With this improvement, she will have greater income and can continue growing her business, allowing her to continue saving to be able to complete her greatest dream: giving her children a profession and having a store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Cuando inici\u00f3 su negocio comercial invirti\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o capital  y pocos clientes entre los que estaban sus amigos y personas muy cercanas a su familia. Con su esfuerzo su negocio fue creciendo y hoy tienen mas de 60 compradores independientes y adem\u00e1s vende en restaurantes; a sus clientes le toma el pedido, lleva el pescado en la ma\u00f1ana y recupera el dinero en las horas de la tarde; en su vivienda tambi\u00e9n tiene una clientela muy cerca que le compra y le hace encargos frecuentemente. Sus compras las realiza directamente a los pescadores, con quienes ha establecido relaciones comerciales  efectivas.  Fernando vive muy apasionado por esta actividad, porque con ella ha logrado sostener a su familia, tener su propia casa y disfrutar de sus conocimientos en pescado fresco. Su meta mas adelante es tener una pescader\u00eda, donde pueda conservar sus pescados y venderlos en un punto muy reconocido en la orilla del rio; as\u00ed mismo ver a sus hijos realizados y exitosos en lo que emprendan.

In the beginning, he launched his business selling oysters on the streets of the city. Later, he began to familiarize himself with fishing in the river, and worked at that. But the increasing difficulties that arose made him stop this, and just work buying and selling fish such as bocachico, mullet, corvina, and goatfish.\r\n\r\nWhen he started his retail business, he invested a small amount of capital and attracted a few customers among his friends and people very close to his family.  With his effort, his business started to grow, and now he he has more than 60 independent buyers. He also sells to restaurants and takes orders from customers. \r\n\r\nIn the morning he takes the fish around, and collects the money in the afternoon hours. He also has customers living nearby, who buy from him at his home and often place orders with him. He purchases directly from the fishermen, with whom he has established an effective business relationship.\r\n\r\nFernando has a passion for this work, because through it he has managed to support his family, own his own house, and to use his knowledge of fresh fish. His goal is to eventually have a fish store, where he can keep his fish, and sell them at a very well-known place by the river.

This will offer to Eman and her husband better and suitable home living conditions.\n\nEman is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband, Shareef, appears in her Kiva profile photo.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

furniture, so she is requesting a 1,500 USD youth loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing the necessary home furnishings she needs such as: bedroom furniture, new living room furniture, etc. This will improve the family's living conditions.\n\nShahera is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband AlaaAddeen appears in her Kiva profile photo.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":996955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

In search of an income for her family, Raziya started her business of animal husbandry in 2000, with a starting sum of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Raziya's persistence and perseverance, her farm currently brings in around 11,000 som (KGS) a month from the sale of meat and dairy products. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Raziya turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partner\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of dairy cows.

Previously Igor had taken out a loan to build a greenhouse addition for growing seedlings.\r\n\r\nIgor's business has been expanding. Two years ago his annual farming profits were only 36,000 griven. Since that he has began growing vegetables on a professional scale by planting better, more expensive varieties and using new fertilizer mixes. As a result his annual profits doubled.

Three years ago she began working as a street food vendor, but because her necessity increased, she decided to venture into a business with a food stall. For this she bought better ingredients, like fresh meat, tables, chairs and converted part of their home into an area to receive guests. She enjoys what she does and was able to adapt quickly to the work because she has always liked to cook, and with her sales she is able to generate income. Now she has many customers but doesn't have a large enough facility to accommodate all of them. She would like to enlarge her business so it will grow. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she has taken out with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support because it makes her feel more secure in moving forward with her business. She promises to make her payments punctually, like she has done with the previous loans she has taken out.

She describes her greatest business challenge to be competition from other fish sellers in the market. Her highest monthly expense is food and school fees.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Beyshebubu began raising livestock, and this activity became the main source of income for her family. Beyshebubu began her business with a starting capital of 10,000 som (KGS), and was able to grow it so that it now has 10 sheep, 3 cows and 2 horses, and earns a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS). In order to continue developing her business, Beyshebubu has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock and fodder.

Mateo and the other members of her group strive each day to conduct their business activities in their community so that they can improve their incomes. They also motivate other women to engage in their own businesses so that they can help their families get ahead.\r\n\r\nMateo manages a butcher shop where she sells different types of meat such as chicken, beef, and pork. She has been in business for several years and also sells bacon, sausages, and salted meats. Mateo started her business because she needed to generate income for her family. She is receiving her third loan and will invest by purchasing beef, pork, and other ingredients. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of one child who she raises along with her husband.

She has started a business as a mobile money transfer agent in her home city of Chingola in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.\n\nConstance\u2019s biggest dream is to expand her business beyond her home town. She intends to be able to handle huge sums of money as this will enable her to have more profits. However, Constance faces the challenge of having little capital for her business. This means that she cannot conduct transfers that require large sums of money to be received or sent. When she gets the loan, she intends to increase her working capital so that she will be able to handle bigger transfers of money. When she has grown her business, Constance wants to go to college while continuing to run her business.\n\nConstance is convinced that her business is helping her community because many do not know how to read and write and her money transfers do not require complicated paperwork. Also, she provides personalized services so her customers always get all the help they need. This, she believes, is the competitive edge that her business has that will help make enough profits to realize her dream of going to college \n\nIn this Video, Constance is being interviewed by a

Her husband employed, but does not enough to cover the family's needs. For the past two years, Mariam's husband has also been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project.\n\nMariam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of making some necessary repairs to the taxi such as painting, changing the engine, etc., in order to improve the taxi's condition. This will increase the taxi's efficiency and ability to take more requests, which will improve the family's income.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0 percent interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She gets up very early every day so that she can do her housework and then start working in her business.  She works around 7 hours a day and can serve up to 8 customers each day.  She believes that her business is doing well because she offers good customer service, credit facilities and, above all, because she sells good-quality products.\r\n\r\nMaria is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their support she will be able to expand her business a little further and buy summer merchandise such as shorts, sandals, etc.  This improvement will give her a larger range of products to offer her customers and she will increase her income.

is a 65-year-old man, married and a father of five children. He lives in Aden, Yemen. He has a grocery store which has been operating for 12 years. He started his business with limited capital that qualified him to open a grocery. He has some regular customers and is quite preferred in the area because he always strives to keep a variety of products in his store so that his customers will always find what they are looking for. \r\n\r\nLately, he\u2019s noticed that competition has become quite fierce so he\u2019s decided to take the situation in hand because this business is his main source of income and he always wants to stay one step ahead of his competition.\r\n\r\nBased on this, he\u2019s made the decision to invest in his business buying merchandise wholesale so that he can have the store well-stocked with a variety of products that will help him to keep his clientele and to attract new customers.\r\n\r\n Because he does not have the necessary economic resources to invest in the business, he's decided to request a loan of 100,000 YER from AMB.

This is a very active city, because of the influx of tourists who come daily to see the ancient Nazca Lines.  It is also a city that is seeing increasing mining, farming and commercial activities, which are turning this area into one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the southern part of Peru.  Oscar really enjoys the Peruvian cuisine; one of his favorite dishes is the \"Lomo Saltado\" (a traditional Peruvian beef dish.)  In his free time, he really enjoys listening to music, most of all when he has a problem or is in a bad mood, because this relaxes him.  Oscar only has a 5th grade education, but he would have liked to have gotten a university degree.  Oscar is married, and with his wife he has 2 wonderful children, aged 9 and 7, who are both in elementary school.  He really adores them, and they are the driving force behind his life.  He says that without them, he would be nothing, because they are the greatest gift that God has given him.\r\n\r\nOscar works providing taxi services to the residents of his city.  He goes around the streets looking for passengers to whom he can offer his services.  He works about 8 hours a day, during which time he provides services to up to 20 passengers.  But when it is a festival day, he can service up to 50 customers.  He believes that his business is doing well because of all the effort he puts in so that he can get ahead and provide the best for his family.\r\n\r\nOscar is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because with their help he will be able to do maintenance work on his vehicle.  This will permit him to drive a safer vehicle and avoid having it malfunction.  In this way his customers will be safer and will have more confidence in using his services.  With this improvement, he will have more income and will be able to save toward his main dreams, which are \"to provide a good education to his children and to buy himself another vehicle.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":998179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to do

For this reason, she has taken the decision to request a loan from INTEGRAL, to invest in her business, buying supplies (beans, sweet bread, French bread, eggs, coffee, etc.) that will enable her to cope with higher levels of demand.

Sobhya is pictured above, at a FATEN branch.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.
