The family resides in their own traditional Mongolian ger (a portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. His mother retired from work in 2006, and his brother teaches at a kindergarten. He himself has been working as chief of a construction team since 2008. \r\n\r\nAt this time, the price of construction materials is at its lowest level, and he wants to use this opportunity to build his own house. So, he is requesting a loan of 3000000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as cement, bricks, gypsum and planks. As a result, he can begin his house building work in the beginning of spring.  \r\n\r\nThe house will provide the family with a comfortable and warm environment. Also, the family will burn less coal due to their heat conserving future house. This is especially helpful to efforts against air pollution."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1398.28,"image":{"id":1286521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase construction materials such as cement, bricks and planks.

from Sierra Leone!

He began this business because it has a quick turnover.\r\n\r\nIdrissa runs a building materials shop; he sells zinc sheets, iron rods, doors and paint brushes, etc. He has been running this business for eight years. He works at the business from 8:00 am until 8:00 pm, 7 days per week. His other source of income comes from renting out a house. Idrissa says that the main challenge to his business is high rate of theft within the community.\r\n\r\nIdrissa has requested a loan in order to buy more building materials like zinc sheets, iron rods, doors and paint brushes.  The extra income from this loan will allow him to open a savings account and expand his business. In the future, he hopes to open a building materials factory.

She started these businesses by taking a course at the National Training Service (SENA), where she learned the technical skills. After taking her lessons, she decided to put them into practice in order to get an income of her own. Her dream is to own a large store where she can sell all the products she makes.

is a 35-year-old lady.

The family is relatively new to cacao, and currently manages six acres with around 600 productive and 300 newly planted cacao trees. Lucio says cacao farming was inspired by Leticia, who favored cacao because it is perennial as opposed to the most typical Belizean crop package of beans and corn. \n\nThe family is excited about cacao, especially because their trees started producing with just under three years from transplantation. It usually takes five years for ungrafted trees to produce cacao pods. So-called side-grafting is the process of implanting a shoot from a mature tree into a younger one, and results in more productive trees that also take less time to start yielding pods. Lucio says his favorite part of cacao farming is picking out the perfect ripe pods for harvesting. \u201cIt is my favorite job, I\u2019m not out to work somewhere in some company, I work on my farm,\u201d says Lucio, however adding that sometimes it feels like too much work. \n\nLucio and Leticia are requesting this loan to clean and prune productive cacao trees and plant banana in between newly transplanted seedlings to provide necessary shade. Cleaning is the process of clearing underbrush to clear access to trees, and is a process that needs to be repeated three to four times annually in cacao farms in the lush tropical lowlands of Belize. Pruning means cutting excess branches on trees to keep them from growing too tall and unwieldy and to increase yields in the coming season. Shade is a requisite ingredient in cacao farming, what makes this practice especially environmentally friendly since cutting forest is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to growing cacao.\n\nLeticia and Lucio are focused on their daughter\u2019s education, and hope that she will also be of help around the farm. Lucio says he plans to work hard in the coming years to bring up production so the family could invest in building a nice house. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1286814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean and prune six acres of cacao.

Cacao is good, but takes too long to start producing, says Simeon. Cacao trees are a long-term investment for farmers, as they typically start producing between three to five years of transplanting them into the ground. For Simeon, the most common challenges are rodents like quash \u2013 also known as coatimundi \u2013 and squirrels, as well as the woodpecker, who do everything to get to ripe pods before the farmers themselves. \n\nBesides cacao, the family grows orange and the traditional Mayan package of corn, beans and rice. They hope to provide the children with an education, to give them options. \u201cFarming is very hard, but if you have an education, you could get easier jobs, working in buildings,\u201d Simeon told Maya Mountain Cacao, adding that a good education is never wasted on anyone. \n\nThe family is requesting the loan to hire 16 people for one workday to help with cleaning two acres of cacao.

The children are all grown up, with the youngest aged 15, and the oldest 35. All children but the youngest, who\u2019s currently in school, live and work Belize City, the former capital of the country. Because of a recent upsurge in urban violence, Ancelmo says he\u2019d prefer the kids came back to work the land instead.\n\nAncelmo is one of the more experienced cacao farmers in the area, having started as long as 15 years ago. That period marked the first push for cacao planting in Belize with the arrival of the multinational Hershey\u2019s Chocolate. A further expansion in the ranks of cacao farming was the establishment of a local co-op that besides seeds, also provided farmers with stable market access. \n\nFor Ancelmo, the favorite part of cacao farming is harvesting and not finding diseased or bird-eaten pods. \u201cWhen I reach and see the pods yellow, I\u2019m not happy,\u201d he tells Maya Mountain Cacao. The challenging part is pruning, because the trees get tall and hard to reach. Ancelmo says sometimes he has to do it with a ladder, and that takes a long time because it\u2019s slippery and dangerous if you try to rush. When farmers have time to do regular pruning, it keeps the trees from getting too tall and unwieldy, and also makes them more productive in the coming season. \n\nIn the near future, the family hopes to expand their cacao fields by planting 1,000 trees. Once they are productive, they hope to invest in home improvement. The current loan will be used for cleaning and pruning around 450 cacao trees, and will require and create the equivalent of 20 days of labor in the community. Ancelmo also plans to rehabilitate an additional 2 acre plot he hasn\u2019t been managing because of time constraints and hard to work, hilly terrain. Rehabilitation here refers to cleaning and pruning the trees that are still standing and planting new ones in place of withered ones. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.27,"image":{"id":1286843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Clean, prune one acre of cacao and rehabilitate two acres of older cacao trees.

Transplanting is the process of planting into the ground seedlings that have been raised in bags for at least six months. The work will require hiring four people for two days of work, while Santiago plans to do the clearing work himself over a longer period of time. \n\nSantiago is currently saving up money to get his land surveyed so the family could get an official title to the land they are working. Private ownership already exists in Red Bank, however to claim it farmers need to hire surveyors. An alternative to privately owned land is a communal land system that is still commonplace in many Mayan villages throughout Belize. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1286847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean and prune cacao fields and transplant new seedlings.

They raised seven children, aged between 17 and 32, all of who have jobs and live outside of the village communities. Two of the youngest are currently studying in the University of Belize, and all others have already completed schooling. \n \n\u201cI did hard work to send every single one to school,\u201d says Placido. The couple works the farm together - Florentina helps with tasks like setting up nurseries, filling the bags with seeds and harvesting, as do the kids when they\u2019re around. Cleaning, however, is something Placido either has to do himself or hire outside help.  Cacao is a good crop, he assures, because it\u2019s permanent: \u201crain or shine, it\u2019s there,\u201d he says. A cacao farmer of five years and counting, Placido got into the business by recommendation: \u201cI always listen to good advice,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao. He started by buying bags and cacao fruit for seeds that he himself planted into bags instead of starting from pre-raised seedlings. \u201cMost people told me I can\u2019t do it, because that\u2019s not how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said, confessing that he himself was relieved and very happy once his cacao started bearing fruit.  \n\nFor Placido, the best part of farming is his routinely check on the farm, when he visits the nursery and trees to check on progress. The hardest is cleaning the bush, he says, adding that it\u2019s especially tricky when you have freshly planted cacao, which you can accidentally chop together with the surrounding underbrush. Besides farming, Placido has a side cattle business and runs a little grocery store in Pueblo Viejo. In the future, if health allows, he hopes to expand what he already started \u2013 the cacao farm, cattle, improve his shop and continue working on his house to better accommodate the regularly visiting kids. The family hopes they\u2019ve set a good example for their children, who can each accomplish more than their parents because of the added benefit of education. \u201cI can do little. They\u2019re going to school and getting valuable experience, so they can do more,\u201d he says. \n\nFlorentina and Placido are requesting this loan to hire help to clean around 500 newly planted trees over two acres of tropical lowlands. Cleaning means clearing the underbrush to open access to cacao trees, which grow literally in the middle of the jungle. Farmers typically clean three to four times a year to keep their trees accessible. The job at hand will require hiring four people to clear the underbrush for 2 weeks. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1286859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Clean 2 acres of recently transplanted cacao trees.

and Bernarda are raising five children and farm around 4.5 acres of cacao in the village of Pueblo Viejo. The kids are aged five to 13, and three are currently in school. Besides farming, Bernarda and Fileon make crafts to sell in town \u2013 hand-carved calabash ornaments and lamp shades among other decorative items.\n\nFileon got the idea to plant cacao eight years ago after meeting a chocolate maker while selling his crafts in town and subsequently requesting bags to raise cacao seeds from the local co-op. He then proceeded to clear some bush to make room for the cacao under the canopy of native trees and has been caring for it ever since. Besides the access to market for one of very few viable cash crops in Belize, the family likes cacao for use at the home. \u201cI like it, because I roast some and then drink it instead of coffee,\u201d says Fileon, adding that store-bought coffee is probably not good for you, while cacao keeps him healthy and working hard. For Fileon, the best part of cacao farming is seeing the trees clean and nicely pruned. The most challenging is that cacao grows naturally in an environment shared with animals, who enjoy chewing on the roots \u2013 like peccaries, and the fruit \u2013 like squirrels and birds, says Fileon. \n\nThe family is happy to be able to send their kids to school, which in Belize comes with tuition for each child in any level of public education. Fileon says he hopes the kids end up going to university, as it was something he would have wanted, but didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do himself. \u201cNow they have options, they can work the farm or get other jobs too,\u201d Fileon told Maya Mountain Cacao. In the future, Fileon wants to start working on a house of a more appropriate size for his large family and to keep busy with the crafts and farm. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to clean and prune around 1,500 productive cacao trees and set up a nursery for 500 new plants. Cleaning is done by using a machete to clean underbrush that continually grows around cacao trees, in order to make them accessible for pruning and harvest. Pruning is the process of cutting excess branches from trees to keep them from intertwining with one another and producing at their highest capacity. Planting requires bagging seeds that are kept in a nursery until the seedlings have around 4 leaves and are ready for transplantation into the ground. The job at hand will require and create the equivalent of 22 days of labor in the community. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.27,"image":{"id":1286864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Clean and prune 1,500 cacao trees, set up new nursery.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \n\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

In 2002, while looking for a source of income for her family, Shaarkan launched her own livestock business with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and tenacity, today she runs a very well developed dairy farm. Her monthly profits total roughly 8,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue growing her business, Shaarkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase cows and thereby increase her income from milk sales. In the future, Shaarkan would like to increase the size of her herd and further expand her

que hered\u00f3,  se ha forjado camino para salir adelante por su familia; su hijo y su pareja con quienes vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Su comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\n\u00c1ngel aprendi\u00f3 de su padre la labor de realizar acabados de construcci\u00f3n en las viviendas urbanas y rurales de la Provincia. Con esfuerzo y mucha incertidumbre inici\u00f3 este negocio hace 3 a\u00f1os, con el sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda poder brindar a su familia una vida de calidad y excelencia. Su trabajo se alterna entre dise\u00f1o de alacenas para cocinas, instalaci\u00f3n de baldosa, azulejo, duelas en los pisos, paredes, pintura, puertas, etc. Es muy importante para este trabajo identificar bien los gustos de los clientes y las preferencias que tienen para la decoraci\u00f3n de sus hogares. \u00c1ngel dedica a este trabajo 8 horas cada d\u00eda en las cuales puede permanecer en una sola vivienda o atender varias. En el transcurso del tiempo, este hombre sin duda luchador, ha visto la necesidad de incurrir en la compra de algunas herramientas que facilitar\u00e1n y agilitar\u00e1n su trabajo, para lo cual solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le ayudar\u00e1 en la compra de estas herramientas. El mayor obst\u00e1culo que \u00c1ngel ha tenido para fortalecer su negocio es la falta de capital por la dificultad de las instituciones financieras para otorgar cr\u00e9ditos a las personas de escasos recursos de las zonas rurales. Sin embargo, gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de un ejecutivo de cr\u00e9dito de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ha encontrado el apoyo y asesor\u00eda que \u00e9l esperaba. \u00c1ngel da gracias a las personas alrededor del mundo que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva aportan para que \u00e9l obtenga el capital que desde hace tanto tiempo le ha hecho falta. ","en":"\u00c1ngel is 25 years old and only was able to finish high school through much effort.  He is single and, thanks to the entreprenurial spirit he inherited, has been able to provide for his family.  He lives with his partner and son in the parish of R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo which is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas in Ecuador.  This province has shown considerable sustained growth over the last few years.  The capital is known for its delicious fruit and gastronomy, and has become the major commercial route between the sierra and coastal regions of the country.  Both local and foreign tourists visit the many tourist attractions and warm climate.  Most of the inhabitants are involved in some type of commercial or service business catering to the local population and tourists.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel learned his trade from his father.  He is a construction worker in urban and rural residential areas of the province.  He started his business three years ago, with much effort and uncertainty, in an effort to give his family a better quality of life.  He alternates his work with designing kitchens, installing tile and flooring, painting walls, doors, etc.  This job requires being able to identify a customer's preferences for home decoration.  \u00c1ngel works eight hours a day, either in a single house or among several.  Over time, this hard worker has observed a need to buy certain tools to help facilitate his work, so he is requesting a loan to buy these tools.  \u00c1ngel's greatest obstacle for strengthening his business has been the lack of capital.  This is due to the fact that lending institutions are not likely to give loans to low-income earners in rural areas.  However, thanks to the recommendation of a loan executive at Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, he has found the support and advice he hoped for.  \u00c1ngel is grateful to people around the world who, through Kiva, are giving him the capital he so badly needs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975.7,"image":{"id":1286633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To

In the process, she gave her shop a completely new image.  It is now better stocked, but has a faster turnover and her buffer stock is often insufficient to meet demand. This means that her purchases do not last long, but she feels happy because she sells everything.

She has been in this business for eight years now and it is continuously growing. She also sells meat and rice. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help cover her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nDezelyn hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store and dreams of giving a quality education to her children. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

During this time of year, the price of construction materials generally reaches its lowest level. As a result, purchasing materials at this time will enable her to save money for the upcoming White Moon festival (a traditional Mongolian ceremony). Most importantly, the renovated house will have the benefit of not losing heat so easily, contributing to the efforts against air pollution by enabling the family to burn less coal.

She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Now, he would like to buy several cows and thus increase the size of his herd. Despite his age, Ahmad runs his business on his own and personally takes his cattle to the market to sell it. He is unable to sit still, is always doing something, and is glad to be occupied with his favourite work. Ahmad is planning to use this loan to buy cattle and animal feed. He will fatten the animals and then sell them in the spring, when livestock prices go up.

","en":"     A very capable young man named Ravshan is one of a small number of people that started a business in the field of baking at a young age. He is now 26 years old and when he was a child, he used to apprentice under the guidance of his uncle, who is a \"nonvoy\" (bread baker.) Every day, young Ravshan observed how his uncle mixed the dough, placed it into a circular baking pan and formed it in a tandoor oven. He watched with admiration how the dough deepened its colour in the tandoor as it baked into Tajikistani national flatbread. This is the reason for his interest in, and attachment to, the profession of baking.\r\n     Now Ravshan is a professional baker and has been working independently for 3 years. By making the most of his experience and acquired skills, he was able to open his own bakery. He can earn his living and feed his family in this way. He is married and has 3 children. At present, he rents his premises and employs one assistant. He wants to expand his business and buy more ingredients to bake flatbread. In the hopes of a bright future, he has decided to seek a loan so that his business does not plateau, and so he can ensure a stable income for his family. As Ravshan himself says, \"I hope that the loan I obtain will justify my hope that I can expand, and that my business will not reach a plateau.\"   \r\n     Ravshan plans to use this loan to purchase several bags of flour, yeast, and butter. He is really striving to make sure that his family does not want for anything, and he works day and night. He extends his gratitude to such organisations as Kiva for the financial support and understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  .

His wife stays at home and raises the kids, while Mansurjon works at an oil-producing factory. He has a good income, and the family has decided to live on their own, apart from their parents.\r\n\r\nMansurjon is planning to repair his home, which is in need of work, but does not have enough funds to do so, since everything he earns at the factory is spent on the family's living expenses. Mansurjon dreams of raising his children in best living conditions and tries to do everything to turn these plans into reality. He will use this loan to purchase building materials and begin repairing the roof of his house. Then, as he gradually saves more money, he'll repair the rest of the house step-by-step.

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. Jonny reside en la Parroquia Luz de Am\u00e9rica de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que es considerado como el port\u00f3n de entrada a la Provincia, por la riqueza de su tierra, ha sido el nido de varias empresas productoras de alimentos adem\u00e1s que es la zona de mayor producci\u00f3n de papaya, fruta ex\u00f3tica exportada desde aqu\u00ed. Es por esto que los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y tambi\u00e9n a la ganader\u00eda lo cual ha sido la motivaci\u00f3n para que varios emprendedores de la zona fortalezcan esta actividad con su trabajo, experiencia y  esfuerzo.\nJonny es un hombre que desde ni\u00f1o aprendi\u00f3 con sus padres a criar animales de todo tipo, su ayuda era esencial para que sus padres cumplieran a cabalidad el trabajo que realizaban para tener el sustento diario en casa.

He completed his primary school education in a public school in the area and lives in Santo Domingo canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountainous and coastal regions of Ecuador. It is a city that has become a commercial hub with several growth sectors and as proof you have several enterprising families that began some years ago with small businesses which have now become small enterprises contributing to job growth. Studies reveal that a majority of the businesses began by trial ad error and that they have been well received by passing tourists, businessmen and travelers who move from one region to another. Moreover, Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the country. \r\n\r\nJonny lives in Luz de Am\u00e9rica parish in this canton, an area considered the gateway to the province because of the richness of its soil. It has been the birthplace of several food companies as well as the area of greatest papaya production and exportation of exotic fruit. Consequently most of the inhabitants of the parish engage in agriculture and also livestock raising, a factor motivating several entrepreneurs in the area to strengthen these enterprises through their work, experience and effort.\r\n\r\nJonny is a man who, from the time he was a child, learned how to raise all kinds of animals from his parents. His help was essential so that his parents could meet their responsibilities of putting food on the table. For the past two years Jonny has been working independently raising pigs and ducks for later re-sale. He manages their feeding and health needs during their stay before selling them at market for a good price. These tasks take about 8 hours every day on different schedules depending on the needs of the animals and weather conditions.\r\n\r\nJonny has seen the need to expand and upgrade the sheds where his animals stay and has requested a loan for this purpose as well as to buy animal feed wholesale so that he can obtain the best price from his provider. Previously, Jonny has had difficulty obtaining loans from various financial institutions because he lives in a rural parish several kilometers from the city and this has made it difficult for the loan officers to make the long trip required to reach his house. Thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, this barrier has been overcome since they care about people in rural areas, and thanks to Kiva,  today Jonny is able to receive the help that he needs to grow as a small business man, a dream that many of you are a part of!!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1287390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to upgrade his livestock sheds and to pay for animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonny Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":844.8,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":85.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":91.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77,"local_amount":76.53,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068712,"comment":null},{"amount":80.54,"local_amount":80.05,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494980,"comment":null},{"amount":80.66,"local_amount":80.16,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524908,"comment":null},{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":82.13,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":82.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133212,"comment":null},{"amount":83.88,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313751,"comment":null},{"amount":85.8,"local_amount":85.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":85.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565357,"comment":null},{"amount":87.21,"local_amount":86.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814398,"comment":null},{"amount":88.94,"local_amount":88.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":88.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320574,"comment":null},{"amount":90.8,"local_amount":90.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856270,"comment":null},{"amount":92.54,"local_amount":91.97,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":92.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059847,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T21:52:52Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523296,"name":"Joel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joel  is 37 years old, married and the father of three children who range in age from 5 months to 15 years old.

En este hermoso y caluroso ambiente desde hace 15 a\u00f1os organiz\u00f3 su microempresa de confecciones, siguiendo la tradici\u00f3n de su familia, dedicada principalmente a las actividades de modister\u00eda.

Sus metas de abordar nuevos clientes son permanentes, pero tiene un capital de trabajo con el cual no alcanza a cumplir sus prop\u00f3sitos.

She lives in the town of Cartagena de Indias, also known as \"la heroica\" (\"the heroic one\"), located in the northern coast of Colombia like a star in the Caribbean sea. It was in these charming and warm surroundings that she first started her sewing business 15 years ago, following her family's tradition of working mainly in dressmaking-related activities. Her main lines of work are women's dresses, blouses and pants, and also uniforms, which she usually makes when she gets contracts. She sells on credit of 7 days, all the while making her purchases by cash every 7 days as well. Her goal of gaining new customers is enduring, but the working capital that she has is not enough to accomplish this purpose. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She'll use it to purchase fabric, thread, zippers and sewing supplies so that she can make new designs in accordance with the current demands. That's precisely the reason why her Kiva loan will be successful - because it will meet the demands of the market, and also because her experience allows her to select the customers with the best credit record."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":497.7,"image":{"id":1286770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase fabric, thread, zippers and sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Libia  Del  Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":65090},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82009},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83923},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85881},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87885},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89935},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92034},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94181},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96379},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98628},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100929},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":123126}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":65090,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":65747.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497987,"comment":null},{"amount":46.6,"local_amount":82009,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":82836.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527801,"comment":null},{"amount":47.68,"local_amount":83923,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84770.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928548,"comment":null},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":85881,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":86747.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705698,"comment":null},{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":87885,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88772.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967987,"comment":null},{"amount":51.1,"local_amount":89935,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:21:07Z","rounded_local_amount":90842.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817184,"comment":null},{"amount":52.29,"local_amount":92034,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":92963.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323461,"comment":null},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":94181,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":95131.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082704,"comment":null},{"amount":54.76,"local_amount":96379,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":97351.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062088,"comment":null},{"amount":56.04,"local_amount":98628,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":99623.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-31T17:48:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523300,"name":"Jona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jona is 40 years old and married.

She will save her profits to expand her business and to take care of her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160.06,"image":{"id":1287385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cases of tomatoes and bags of peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6874},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7139},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7405},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7670},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7936},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8201},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8465},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8731},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8996},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9262},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9526},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9795}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":15.47,"local_amount":6874,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7474.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437399,"comment":null},{"amount":16.06,"local_amount":7139,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-25T08:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7762.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842449,"comment":null},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":7405,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-31T08:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8052.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610463,"comment":null},{"amount":11.32,"local_amount":5029,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5468.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399724008,"comment":null},{"amount":23.81,"local_amount":10582,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":11506.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409993005,"comment":null},{"amount":18.92,"local_amount":8408,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T09:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":9142.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419757591,"comment":null},{"amount":16.69,"local_amount":7418,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8066.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429407666,"comment":null},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":18282,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":19879.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625810,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-31T17:42:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523545,"name":"Hijos Del Sol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este BC se llama \u201cHijos del Sol\u201d, lo componen 19 emprendedores, todos tienen distintos negocios hay electricistas, tapiceros, fot\u00f3grafos, artesanos, vendedores de ropas, costureras, entre otros.

She also likes the relationship with others, particularly as a foreigner.  She has been warmly welcomed into the group.\r\n\r\nIndependencia, in the north of the city, is one of the 34 communes that make up Chile's capital, Santiago.  It emerged at the end of the nineteenth century as a traditional area.  Its centre is Avenida Independencia, the road along which the ancient \"Camino del Inca\" (Inca path) ran.  This was the main entry from the north into the city of Santiago.  Given its large indigenous population, it is in Independencia that you find Chile's Indigenous Culture Centre.  The area also has various significant, historic buildings, including six of the country's monuments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7400,"image":{"id":1287381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

He decided to open his own beauty salon when he was living in the community of Los Esteros. Since he always enjoyed this line of work, he decided to continue when he moved to a new community.\r\n\r\nJose offers haircuts for women, men, and children in the beauty salon. He also offers perms and styles hair, among other services. He works with plenty of enthusiasm because he likes his profession very much. Women's haircuts cost $3.50, men's cost $2.50, and children's cuts cost $2.00.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties which Jose faces working in the salon are crime, a lack of time, and rainy periods. Jose has many aspirations for his business. Therefore, he is applying for a loan to buy a hair dryer and a sofa for men's hairstyles, and makeup.\r\n\r\nIn an interview, Jose said: \"My aspirations and goals for my business in the future are to have the necessary clientele to have a better income, to help my relatives as much as I can, and to offer employment to my friends in order to help them.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1286779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sofa and a hair dryer for styling men's hair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":40.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013739,"comment":null},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":46.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356454103,"comment":null},{"amount":45.99,"local_amount":45.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459938,"comment":null},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":47.75,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":47.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373088253,"comment":null},{"amount":48.31,"local_amount":48.31,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":48.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632398,"comment":null},{"amount":49.69,"local_amount":49.69,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":49.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390496243,"comment":null},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":50.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-25T08:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":401233574,"comment":null},{"amount":51.7,"local_amount":51.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410489401,"comment":null},{"amount":219,"local_amount":219,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":219,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420517794,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-03T10:39:10Z","paid_date":"2013-11-21T09:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523310,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane repaid her last loan and from the proceeds joined a group of other farmers who are undertaking livestock farming.

Cristi, as her friends call her, is 52, and has been married to Silverio for 36 years. They have six children, who now live on their own. She did not have the opportunity to go to school, but she has several businesses that help pay her household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe is applying to Vision Fund and Kiva for a loan to stock her grocery store and to buy condiments to make the sandwiches she sells. She opened her store 10 years ago and never imagined that the business would be so helpful. Her husband supported her initiative because his income alone would not cover their children's  education and household expenses.\r\n\r\nIt takes Cristi little time to prepare the sandwiches because she used to sell food; however, at times she doesn't have enough money to buy good cooking utensils, dishes, and so forth. The loan will help her buy items now to get her kitchen running again. Cristi says that the grocery store is going well, though the uncertainty she is experiencing today is somewhat worrisome. In addition to running the grocery store and kitchen, Cristi attends school. She works most of the day, and her daughter-in-law helps her in the store and kitchen.\r\n\r\nCristi expects both of her businesses to be successful and generate income to improve her and her husband's lives. She is grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loans they have granted her to sustain her businesses.

Before, there were only four members but two more have now joined.  They say that they really enjoyed working with Vision Found and Kiva and so decided to come back for another loan.  The members themselves chose the group's name as \"alcatraz\" means \"abundance\".  Ceci is one member of the group.  She is 49 years old and married to Genaro, who works in the country.  Together they have a family with ten children, three of whom still depend on their parents as they are studying.  Ceci has a small grocery story that she started a year ago.  She says that she already had premises but she just had not decided exactly what kind of business to have.  She finally opted for a small grocery store.  Ceci tells us she is very happy with the success she has had with her business as her earning have helped to improve her children and her and her husband's living conditions.  However, what she most likes is being able to chat with customers, and she is always excited to know how they are.  Ceci said \"I really like my business but my only difficulty is I have no fridge for storing cold meats and yoghurts.  Before I sold cheese but with no fridge I had to stop because it would very quickly go off\".  Despite this difficulty, though, Ceci is very happy and very grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan provided.  Thanks to this financial support, she will be able to realise her dream which is for her grocery store to expand and to sell everything and, laughing, she says, it's \"almost, almost a corner shop\".  With expansion, she can have the necessary support so her children can have a better education.  Just as Ceci has dream, so do the other members of the group.  So, they are applying for this loan to invest in their work.  Juan will invest in the greenhouse for his raspberries; Virginia  will invest in a boiled corn grinder; Raudel will invest in oil for cars; Sara will invest in clothes and finally Guillermo will use his loan for his taxi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1286860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy milk, bread, eggs, drinks, fried foods, juices and such like.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El oro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahudel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4250},{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199277,"comment":null},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596071,"comment":null},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663498,"comment":null},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4250,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048915,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-04T11:47:44Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523551,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis de 49 a\u00f1os de edad vive en el municipio de Soledad-departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico-, con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hija de 8 a\u00f1os.

Deciding to take advantage of these skills, Luis began making cards, clipboards, napkin rings, frames, and all the things his creativity allowed and his customers' desires called for.\r\n\r\nThe business is successful, and slowly he has improved it. Today his goal is to make better quality products and export them. To meet this challenge, he is using social networks and \"knocking on a lot of doors.\" He is applying for his first Kiva loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy fabric, thread, paint, wood, and wood bases. He has many outstanding orders, but he lacks working capital to fill them and meet the demand that will make this Kiva investment successful.

","en":"Ninfa is 26 and has enjoyed working since she was very young. Three years ago, she opened a grocery store in her house so that she could help her husband meet household expenses. She started with a small table of sweets, which was successful because there is a high school and elementary school nearby. She added more items such as sodas, juices, and homemade sandwiches. Slowly, the business grew, and now she has a grocery store. She is the single mother of two children (she is separated), and she wants to help her children get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a loan to stock her store and will also sell to another store where nonperishable items are sold at discount prices. She dreams of expanding her store and having arcade machines the local children can play. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank Las Nenas, which she joined because the women members were pleasant and young-at-heart.

He's had a business selling the most popular newspapers in Guayaquil, such as \u201cEl universo,\" and  \u201cLa extra,\" and lottery tickets in the center of the city for 10 years.  He works from 6am until 11am.  \r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties he faces in selling newspapers is that he has a disability.  He lost both arms in a work accident 20 years ago.  He was working as a metalworker for a company when he was injured by an electric shock, and the doctors had to remove his arms to prevent gangrene from reaching his heart.  This has made it difficult for him to do normal work like other people.  However, in spite of his disability, he continues to work so that he can provide the best for his two children.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate more income he also has 2 apartments in his house that he rents out, because years ago he inherited a house and took advantage of the opportunity to build and rent out these spaces.  One of the apartments rents monthly for $75, the other for $130.  Ciro has a lot of aspirations for his business and his apartment rentals, and for this reason, he wants to take a loan so that he can make some improvements to the apartments.  This way he can charge more rent and obtain more income.  To do this, he wants to buy paint, cement, and cement blocks for the repairs to the apartments.  \r\n\r\nIn the interview, Ciro told us, \"My plans for the long term are to provide my children with a good education, and improve my house so that I can have more income that is independent from my business selling newspapers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":548.94,"image":{"id":1286841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy paint, cement, and cement blocks to improve the apartments that he rents","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ciro Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":673.25,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.25,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356454105,"comment":null},{"amount":52.9,"local_amount":52.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373088255,"comment":null},{"amount":53.21,"local_amount":53.08,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":53.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381632400,"comment":null},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":54.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":54.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390496245,"comment":null},{"amount":55.68,"local_amount":55.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-25T08:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":55.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":401233576,"comment":null},{"amount":90.32,"local_amount":90.09,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":90.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410489403,"comment":null},{"amount":84.36,"local_amount":84.14,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":84.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420517796,"comment":null},{"amount":0.34,"local_amount":0.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":0.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427615,"comment":null},{"amount":61.09,"local_amount":60.93,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439943304,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-05T15:01:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523326,"name":"Antonieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonieta works hard to support six children.

Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds.

","en":"Mar\u00eda is a 57-year-old woman. She had no schooling because of the scarcity of resources in her home. She got married when she was very young to Felipe who is now 63 and who works for himself in farming. They no longer have dependents since all their children are grown and independent. Mar\u00eda was born in Chone but many years ago went to live the Santo Domingo hamlet of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo connects the Sierra Region with the Coastal Region of Ecuador. The city has become a commercial corridor with a number of growing industries, and as proof, there are various entrepreneurial families who some years ago began their own businesses and now are micro-business owners who help generate employment. Studies reveal that the majority of the businesses began out of hands-on experience and have caught on due to the travel of tourists, business persons and travelers from region to region; furthermore, it is the third-most inhabited city in the country. Mar\u00eda resides in the Puerto Lim\u00f3n Parish of this hamlet, a place which was inhabited by a ts\u00e1chila community and has a number of tourist attractions although it is quite far from the city. In addition, the great majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in crop farming and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nThree years ago Mar\u00eda was devoting herself solely to household tasks. However, concern for her future in later years took hold in her, and so she decided to contribute also to the sustenance of her home selling pigs and chickens, an activity she she tends to in the mornings, afternoons and sometimes at night when special precautions must be taken on account of weather conditions. Now she has applied for her first loan which will be used to purchase commercial feed and supplies so her animals may have the diet and necessary care that would allow them to grow healthy and strong, which makes them more desirable in the marketplace. Mar\u00eda has tried to take out loans at various institutions and banks where unfortunately they have refused to grant the money, owing to the difficulty in visiting the client in the highly isolated rural area where she lives. Nevertheless Mar\u00eda kept on fighting tirelessly and, thanks to the involvement of Kiva with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she is happy because she can take the first step towards growing her business and so maintain some savings against chance events that might arise in her and her husband's old age. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1287405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase commercial feed and supplies for raising her animals.

After the tax is paid he will offer a service to local people as a taxi driver. The income of the family will increase, and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

They have 50 chairs, a PICK-UP or a very powerful sound system, and two coolers where they store drinks.

Her goal is to diversify her menu and add food items, which her clients look forward to in the future. \r\n\r\nAdriana is requesting this Kiva loan, which is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use this loan to buy beer so she will be ready for the celebrations leading up to and during Carnival, when demand increases. During these four days the country's most incredible celebrations take place, including the colorful Carnival of Barranquilla, with much percussion music and a variety of traditional costumes from all over the world.

The group members are very hardworking and responsible people characterized by their happiness and their good friendships with each other.  They say they chose the name of their group \"because we used to meet in a huge garden where there was a lot of fruit, such as apples, pears, figs, lemons, etc.  But look where we are now.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are very grateful to and happy about VisionFund and Kiva because they'll be able to invest in their jobs.  Reyna will buy bedspreads and blankets, Petra and Alma Jazm\u00edn will buy crafts, \u00c1ngela will invest in painting napkins, and, finally, Victoria will invest in her sheep.\r\n\r\nFrancisco, who's also part of the group, says he's 35 years old and has been married to Isabel for 15 years.  Together they formed a family with two children who are students.  Francisco has a jewelry business.  He makes a living selling jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, pendant earrings, chains, watches, and bangles.  He makes repairs in the same jewelry business.  He sells athletic t-shirts, stuffed toys, gifts, etc.\r\n\r\nHe says he started his business five years ago because one day his wife dreamed they were selling gold.  One day when they were on a trip to Zitacuaro they bought gold and his wife sold it to her friends, and they saw that it worked out well so Francisco decided to set up a jewelry shop.  Previously he was the manager of a gas station.  He says he liked his job a lot but that the schedule was difficult; he even had to work on the weekends.  This affected his family life with his children and his wife because he hardly saw them.\r\n\r\nFrancisco says that with his severance pay he had the money to set up a small shop where he began selling with only two trays of jewelry.  In time it improved a lot because he learned to do repairs, and now it's going very well for him.  Francisco's very happy with his business: \"Now, with my jewelry shop, I lead a much more peaceful life without stress.  I can manage my schedule and spend the majority of my time with them (his family).  I can even go out on the weekend, which wasn't possible before because of my job.  I can open and close whenever I want.\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco has no problems with his business.  He even gives a job to one employee who helps him tend to the business.  His goal is for his business to grow and to get better earnings to live a better quality of life.  What is most important for Francisco, though, is for his children to finish their professional studies \"so they have a better quality of life than mine.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1286895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy jewelry and gifts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-31T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-02T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Jazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":58000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":7250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1715.63,"local_amount":21750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":21831.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199279,"comment":null},{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":14500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14554.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596072,"comment":null},{"amount":1715.62,"local_amount":21750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":21831.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663500,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-13T12:28:46Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":523416,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is married and 32 years old.

Do\u00f1a Elvira quien forma parte del grupo platica que tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Delfino quien trabaja en el campo desde hace 25 a\u00f1os juntos formaron una familia con cinco hijos de los cuales dos de ellos son aun dependientes que se encuentran estudiando.

It is a group that like to live characterized by the great friendship that is between them. The members of the group talked among each other and chose the name because of where the group began and where they met, on a farm with the name Altamirano\". Elvira, a member of the group, is 44 years old, and is married to Delfino who works in the fields. They started a family 25 years ago with 5 children of whom 2 are still dependents who are studying. Elvira raises sheep for a living, and has done so for 20 years. She began her job because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses. At that time her 5 children were very young and the expenses were great. It was for this reason and Elvira became motivated to begin raising lambs. She is currently requested a loan from the institution to purchase 2 lambs and pasture. Elvira buys small animals to raise, grow large and strong, and then sell them. She says that many times in the season of parties, weddings, baptisms, etc. they go to her home to purchase the lambs. She says, \"I like very much when my sheep give birth to their lambs. For me it is a big satisfaction because I see the lambs grow.\" Her only difficulty is her lack of a good shed and  and her lambs get sick and die and for Elvira this represents a loss of earning and her investment. Elvira's goal is to be able to have more lambs and pigs to raise and sell, and to increase her income to cover the costs of her children's education so that they can have a better quality of life. Team members are Mar\u00eda Isabel, Patricia, Jessica, Ma Albertha will invest in buying and selling pigs for breeding. Teresa and Mar\u00eda Eva will invest in the purchase and raising of lambs to sell. Finally Anayely will invest in chickens to raise and sell. They are all very grateful to Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan offered to them. It will be a great help to improve their businesses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1287565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

He says that he \u201cstarted selling avocados and I saw that the sales were going well, so I decided to expand my business and to stock seasonal fruit. Now with the new loan I will buy watermelons, yam beans, oranges, mandarin oranges, cantaloupe and honeydew melons and avocados\u201d. \r\n\r\nHe says that he will buy part of the fruit from the central wholesale market Zitacuaro, a nearby town. He will sell the fruit in the open air markets in M\u00e9xico state and using the van he owns he will also sell in other towns. He says that his dream is to buy a piece of land where he can establish a stable business and in that way have more time with his family as he has a child in primary school. The other members of the group are called Mar\u00eda, Jose and Agustina.

His biggest customers are local schools that order desks and the local people from his village. Martin started this business back in 2001 to improve his living standards, the same dream he still harbors. His future plan is to expand this business, and to bring as many youths who have that talent to exercise them and showcase their skills and abilities. This will in turn create jobs for many, and develop him and the country at large.

They are relatives and they live in a community where the people are characterized by being very hard-working and responsible. \r\n\r\nGaby is one of the members. She tells us she is 37 years old and has been married to her husband Lucio since she was 21. Together they have three children. Two of them are studying and the youngest doesn't go to school yet. \r\n\r\nGaby is a very hard-working person. She works making tortillas but also looks after the grocery shop that her sister Magaly has passed on to her. Gaby says that this time she is applying for a loan to buy corn and products like bread, eggs, milk, soft-drinks, sugar e.t.c To stock her grocery shop by making tortillas has already taken a year and the shop has been going for the same amount of time. Gaby said she wanted to start by making tortillas because she wanted to help her husband with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nGaby said, 'I really like my work and more when there are profits, only at this time I haven't been doing so well considering that at the moment people have corn that they harvested at the end of the year. So right now I wont do well with the profits of tortilla sales, although it's only for a period because half-way through the year people find themselves with no corn and so start to buy tortillas. But I will work harder in the shop to make up for it regarding the profits.'\r\n\r\nGaby's goal is to gain more customers to increase her profits so she will be able to offer her children a better quality of life. Just like Gaby who has dreams, the other members of the group are applying for loans to invest in their businesses. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda will invest in the sale of tortillas and vegetables and Luis Enrique in the grocery store.

Hafiswa is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kinoni in the Masaka region of Uganda. For the past year, Hafiswa has been working hard to manage her market stall, which sells fresh vegetables. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hafiswa has requested a loan of 600000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh vegetables to expand her business and generate greater profits, and to buy new clothes for herself. Hafiswa hopes that in the future she will be able to own a plot of land. \r\n\r\nHafiswa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

In fact, the family has no source of income as Kakhaber and his wife are unemployed at the moment. Kakhaber has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but has not had success. His loan requests have been rejected because of his low income and his lack of experience in his job, which is usually important criteria for the local credit providers. \r\n\r\nThis loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Kakhaber will purchase flour and bran at wholesale prices and resell them for a profit. It will be hard work for Kakhaber, but according to estimations his business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase his stock and volume of sales.

He is a very ambitious young man. He and his friend opened a small shop for selling mobile phones and accessories. This store has been operating for six years and is located in a good commercial area in Khanyounis, which makes the project a profitable one and the only source of income for him, but he needs more support to cover some costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad works very hard to improve his living conditions. He is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of mobile phones and accessories. This will increase sales and improve Mohammad's income positively. The photo shows Mohammad in his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has a son and a daughter, both of whom are her responsibility. One of her children is currently a student while the other one stays home to assist in the family\u2019s businesses, which are rice-growing and bean-planting. To support the family, Senghak farms rice and plants bean while her husband catches fish and works for others as a paid worker to supplement the income. Together, this couple can earn around 30,000 KHR per day and save about 10,000 KHR after the daily expenses. Senghak, a fourth-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a member who is a third-time borrower to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,400,000 KHR each. With the previous loans, the group leader Senghak was able to improve the family\u2019s lifestyle. This time, she will use the requested loan portion to buy fertilizer, pesticide, and bean seeds to support her current businesses.

Gracias a sus familiares es que logro abastecer su negocio, con pr\u00e9stamos peque\u00f1os, sin embargo en este tiempo vio que dentro de sus ganancias tambi\u00e9n tiene un margen para sus ahorros, por lo que desea obtener el cr\u00e9dito para abastecer mejor la tienda y tener mejores ganancias y con el tiempo ahorrar para un anticr\u00e9tico. Actualmente vive en casa de familiares, quienes por las ni\u00f1as le dieron cobijo. Pero a medida que las ni\u00f1as crecen necesitan  mayor espacio. La Sra.

Because of the need to support her family, she found it convenient to open a neighborhood store. She has had this business for four years, and this time has given her the opportunity to know about prices and which items to sell and where to obtain them, as well as customers and suppliers. Thanks to her relatives, she managed to stock her business using small loans. Nevertheless, she now sees that within her earnings she also has a margin for her savings, and for this reason she wants to obtain a loan to stock the store better and have better earnings, and with time save for an anticr\u00e9tico [a Bolivian rental agreement in which the rent is paid up front]. She now lives in the house of relatives who gave her shelter for her daughters, but as the girls grow, they will need more space. Se\u00f1ora Petruska also makes pastries and homemade bread, which are also greatly sought after by her neighbors. She says that every day she has to get up very early to satisfy the needs of her customers, since there is also a store very close by with which she has quite a bit of competition, so she sees that if the other store is not open, she has better opportunities for her sales."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000.01,"image":{"id":1270361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
