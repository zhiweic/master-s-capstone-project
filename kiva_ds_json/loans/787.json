She adds her hopes for financial stability rest on farming and more specifically on the poultry business.\r\n\r\nShe is worried though about the high cost of inputs for all farming activities.

Thanks to this work, she has managed to obtain her own plot of farmland where she sows cacao and coffee plants.

At first, Daria worked alone but, since she started her family, she has received the help of her husband and children who support her during difficult times.  During periods of the year when rain is a permanent feature, pests eventually appear and they manage to destroy her plantations.

They both work the land so that they can then grow their plants.  They have been in this business for 13 years.  At harvest time, they have the support of their fellow farmers and neighbors as they work in a reciprocal manner.  They gather in the fruit quickly because they have a lot of experience.  After the harvest, they take their crops to the warehouses in their town where they receive a good price per kilogram.  In the future, Gloria is planning to grow more plants as they are profitable.\r\n\r\nThis will be Gloria's eighth loan from MFP.

Beatriz is a compassionate woman who is committed to her work in the fields where she provides a lot of care for her coffee crops because her family depend on her crop production.  What she most enjoys about her work is being able to work together with her husband and children who encourage her to make progress with her coffee plants.

Cirila is from a town where everyone earns their living from farming and she started working in the green fields there when she was just a girl.  She has had her own farm, growing coffee, for 17 years now.  She operates the farm with help from her partner, Felimon, and a few neighbors.  What she most likes about the business is harversting her crop, reaping the benefits of the very hard work before.

a business offering photocopying, book and thesis bindery, and laminating. He has been engaged in the business for 10 years. He rented a small building which is located nearby the main road. He usually opens the business at 8am and works until 8pm. In order to serve the customers quickly, Imron employs four people to help him run the business.   \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Imron is receiving many orders from the customers but he is worrying about the paper supply. He has saved part of his income but he would like to use that money for his daughter\u2019s tuition fees. \r\n\r\nImron knows that TLM provides an Individual Lending Program that can assist him in meeting all orders. He submitted a loan application and requested a loan of IDR 10,000,000. This loan will be spending on paper.

She operates a variety store business. Lourdes works  hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. Her children help her to maintain the household while she runs her store, which is adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this business, she also prepares and sells cooked viands for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLourdes dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

As an industrial engineer, she used to work for a recycling company but she became sick.  She had to take sick leave and then leave her job.  As she had studied recycling during her time at University, and her dissertation was on this topic, when she became unemployed she decided to start buying recyclable material from big industries which she then sold on to recycling companies and companies that recycle cardboard, PVC, paper, plastics, etc.  Her current dream is to further grow her business and to build her mother a beautiful house.  She also dreams of giving her daughter the opportunity to enjoy a successful future.  Her medium-term goal is to buy machines so that she can process the material herself because her biggest challenge is the competition which creates a lot of pressure in the market in which she works.  While she works towards achieving this goal, Silvana's accounts receivable turnover period is one day and her stock turnover period is three days.  It is based on these financial indicators that she would like to grow her business.  This is why she has applied for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use it to buy raw materials such as cardboard, plastic and rope in larger quantities.  Her investment will be successful because she is negotiating at a good price.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells cooked viand for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElena dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Mariya does not have competition in her market. There is a demand and clientele for the goods she sells. Mariya's shop is in a good location and she has been in business for five years. Currently, Mariya has 35,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in inventory. Her profit is 6,2000 hryvnias. Mariya needs a loan of 12,000 hryvnias to purchase quality goods in Chernovtsi and increase her working assets.

He has a construction business repairing and renovating homes, apartments, offices and other places. Roman started his business five years ago. Prior to this he worked as a security guard and then as a manager before deciding that he needed to go into business for himself. He acquired the minimum equipment needed and began working alone, then recruited 2-3 others to work with him. Currently he manages a team of workers who complete jobs under his direction. Roman requests a loan of 20,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) to purchase construction equipment, specifically two cement mixers. This equipment will help him complete jobs more quickly, increasing the income of his business. Roman is a caring family man, a good friend and a trusted partner to his clients. In people he values qualities such as honesty, initiative, and loyalty. Roman also cares for his mother's elderly sister, who is alone and needs help.

She sells clothing at the market and also sells seeds during the planting season. Previously she worked at a factory. Five years ago the factory closed and Lesya was laid off. Since then she has been her own boss, providing her family with their basic needs - food and clothing. \r\n\r\nLesya's shop is located at a food market where there are always a lot of people. She also puts a small markup on the goods she sells and makes money due to her high sales volume.

age 49, is a single mother with two school age children. She also cares and provides for her elderly mother. \r\nShe sells cloth and material for men's and women's clothes in a local market in Brazzaville. She has had this business for five years and has gained a loyal customer base. \r\nBrigitte believes good customer service is most important to her business' success. She strives to offer her clients the best products and service. Her major difficulty is the lack of consistent business sales. Some weeks she does very well and then other weeks she doesn't sell enough. \r\n\r\nBrigitte has successfully taken two loans from Kiva's partner, HOPE Congo, and has repaid in full and on time.

She utilizes the loans well to improve the quality as well as variety of her merchandise. \r\n\r\nGood customer service is one of Patricia's main business strategies. She has managed to grow a large customer base over the past 32 years because of the relationships she has created. She greets her customers with a smile and is always working to serve them better.  \r\n\r\nPatricia wishes to continue her business growth and is requesting another loan to apply toward expanding her business. Her dreams for her business are to eventually build a boutique to operate in, as well as to be able travel abroad to buy merchandise from other countries.

He lives in Ica, Per\u00fa which is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours south of Lima, the capital of the country. Ica is known by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (the land of sun). It is known in Peru for having earthquakes often (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), it's production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps above all, for being the source of the traditional national drink of Peru, Pisco.\r\n\r\nIt is in this dry and hot climate that the house and business of the client is located. In his free time he enjoys listening to music. As Peru is known for having some of the most delicious food in the world, one of Miguel's favorite dishes is ceviche.

At mid-day, she gets out her tools and heads for her agricultural fields where she sows potatoes, barley, beans and peas.\r\n\r\nIn this season, Nancy rents some parcels because her fields don't produce sufficient crops. She waits anxiously for harvest season, when merchants visit her lands to buy her crops on the spot. She says she already has offers to buy. \r\n\r\nNancy also raises bulls, cows, and pigs and sells them when they are fat and healthy to butchers who visit the region. Now she wishes to begin selling drinks as her customers are requesting them.\r\n\r\nNancy belongs to the \u201cVirgen Maria\u201d (Virgin Mary) solidarity group and this is her 3rd loan through MFP. She awaits this small loan that will help her reach her objectives. And she promises, once more, to comply with the repayment schedule.

She also spends her time carrying out various jobs for the local government, like cleaning up the gardens and pavements.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the capital, and is described by Peruvians as the Land of Sun. It is known for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives and, perhaps above all, for being the origin of the traditional Peruvian national drink, pisco. In this hot, arid climate lives Rafael and his customers. In his free time he likes to go out driving with his son to distract himself from his problems. It is well known that Peru is famous for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Rafael loves is 'aji de gallina' (chilli chicken).\r\n\r\nRafael is a taxi driver and works 15 hours a day providing transport for around 70 customers. He thinks that he does well in his job because he offers a good service and because he respects his customers. He is grateful to Kiva's lenders because, with the help offered, he will be able to carry out maintenance on his vehicle to keep it in a good state, which will mean he can provide a safe service as well as earning a greater income and progress in his biggest dream of owning a fleet of cars and starting a taxi

At home in Huari, her mother has cows and sheep and grows potatoes. She pens the sheep that she buys from the shepherds there, feeds them and fattens them up to sell them later on for a better price at the different markets that are held each week in Huancayo. Now she wants to save some money and open a restaurant where she lives as there aren't any at the moment. She belongs to the loan group \"Santa Teresa\" and this is her first loan from MFP, and she is waiting for a small loan so that she can meet her goals. She also promises to make her repayments.

Together they have 3 small children who they care for in a rented house in the Acraquia area. She feels very happy as she is on the point of owning her own house to live in. She makes a living in multiple ways. During the mornings, she works in a house where she cooks and cleans, and, in the afternoons, she works at a new university that is being built. The state pays her a monthly wage for cleaning services here. But the activity that she never fails to develop is farming. She grows corn, barley, and potatoes on her own land. At each harvest, and after much care, she sells her crops at the main market and also takes advantage of the opportunity to sell the animals that she raises, which include cows, sheep, and chickens. She would like to spend all her time farming but, as she says, \"this is a long-term investment.\"  So, she has to generate income to cover the costs of feeding and educating her children. This is her second loan from MFP, and she is waiting for a small loan so she can meet her goals. She promises to make her repayments. She is grateful to be part of the community bank because all the members are responsible and united people. On receiving her loan, Irma will use it for building her new house, which she will own. She will buy windows, doors, and other items. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1000963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy windows and doors.

He lives in Ica, Peru. \r\n\r\nIca is located in the the Sechura Desert about four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is known to Peruvians as \"The Land of Sun\". It is also known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one at 8.0 in 2007 and another at 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus, and olive production, and perhaps more than anything as the birthplace of Pisco, the traditional national drink of Peru. In this hot and arid climate one can find Ruly's home and business. In his free time he like to play soccer. As is well known, Peru is characterized around the world by its delicious food and one of its most well known dishes is the delicious \"Caldo de Gallina\". Ruly studied up to the fifth year of secondary school but he would have liked to have studied to be a teacher. \r\n\r\nRuly makes a living selling bread from a cart that he has.

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala north region of Uganda. She is single and has 4 children who are all currently in school.

He is completely convinced that he will be a punctual client and, above all, will not disappoint the institution that is allowing him to realize in part his dream.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 800 PEN he will buy some parts and spare parts to refurbish his vehicle, because they deteriorated with the passing of time and the bad road conditions.

He is engaged in the greenhouse farming business and has eight large greenhouses.  His farm is big, but everything is always kept in order.  Every year, Alexander plants 12,000 tomato bushes of both high- and low-growing varieties in his greenhouses.  The part of his land on which he grows tomatoes is situated on the shore of a reservoir, which protects the plantings from morning frosts.  Alexander has been farming for 17 years now.  Every year he has expenses of up to 50,000 hriven (UAH) for seed and plastic film for the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAlexander is planning to invest the 20,000 hriven loan he receives through KIVA in the building of an additional greenhouse on a large piece of land that his family bought last year with the goal of enlarging the farm.  Alexander has future plans to put new greenhouses on the new piece of land, which is 0.87ha in size.  There are also plans to install heating systems in the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nNote: story in
