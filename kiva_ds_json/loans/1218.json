She has lived in the countryside her whole life, where she learned to work in agriculture. She owns farmland of around one and one-half hectare, on which she grows seasonal rice crops. The harvest is collected for basic subsistence and sold in the local marketplace where she lives. This work is the main source of income for her family, with which she provides for all of the household's basic needs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs to hire a few laborers to plow and transplant her rice crops, but she has inadequate money to make it possible.

is a 33-year-old married man. He lives in the small village of Baghdati with his wife, two children, parents, and grandmother. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Pridon has been involved in the agriculture business from early childhood, as his parents are farmers, and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources, and because he had to start working at a very young age, Pridon was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land growing nut trees. Additionally, he has a vineyard, sells wine, and owns 2 cows. His mother milks the cows every day and produces cheese to sell. They always produce high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price.  As the family has only seasonal income, Pridon decided to build a greenhouse and seek credit among local financial institutions. However, his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan to start or re-start businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 3,000 USD. With the credit, he will purchase building materials and build a greenhouse.

is a 29-year-old married man from a small village in the Telavi district, Kakheti region, east Georgia.

This is the only source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nSimon decided to request a loan and purchase five cows. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

Her whole life has been dedicated to looking after her children whom she loves very much: \"I am father and mother to them,\" she says. Her children's educational success have been inspired by their mother's efforts. One son is a university student, while the other studies at home.\r\n\r\nEarly every morning Dorotea sets off to work in the fields for which she receives a daily wage. This allows her to pay for household expenses. She takes advantage of her free time to develop her talent for knitting; in her bag she always carries knitting needles and wool to make hats, scarves, and sweaters which she later sells to the customers she has gained over the years.\r\n\r\nNow Dorotea wants to work even harder because her son's further education will soon be at an end.

He purchases scrap from hawkers and the people of his nearby town. He sells the scrap to a recycling factory. He is committed with a factory; at the end of the month, the factory members collect all the scrap at an agreed amount, from him. He has been doing this same business for many years and earning a reasonable profit for his family.\r\n\r\nRecently, he made a deal with the contractor who is selling the scrap iron obtained in tearing down a building. Due to the large quantity, Arshad does not have enough cash to buy that iron scrap. Therefore, Arshad requested a loan from Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that he could buy scrap iron from the contractor, and could make a rapid increase in his income.\r\n\r\nArshad hopes that this loan will enhance his earning capacity.

His daughter works at a local bakery as a baker, and she gets a small monthly income. Genad has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, because his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Genad was unable to study for a professional career.\r\n\r\nGenad works hard on family-owned agricultural land. He has a vineyard and grows nut trees. He always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. Besides the agricultural activities, he trades in fruits and vegetables seasonally. As the family has only seasonal income, Genad decided to open a grocery store. He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting a business. Genad's application was approved under the framework of this program, and he will get a loan of $5000 US. With the received credit, he will purchase a stock of groceries and will open a grocery store. He will offer a wide assortment of products to his customers, to satisfy them.

This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and it has diverse forests.  Its neighborhoods are inhabited by kind people who follow customs unique to this city.  Several micro-businesses are established here also that are managed by entrepreneurs who strive daily  to make their dreams reality.  Other activities are agriculture and animal husbandry. Abundant crops are produced that are sold to be distributed to many provinces.  There are also many tourist attractions like waterfalls, rivers, paths and resorts that attract tourists to adventure sports that are sold there with safety guaranteed.\r\n\r\nNancy had to start working while still very little helping her parents raise pigs.  She decided too to go into this business for herself 8 years ago  and every time she\u2019s learned more about this activity.  However, three years ago hurricane-strength winds destroyed a large part of the house where she lived and the pigsties.  Despite this, she\u2019s gradually been rebuilding her house and her business where she spends about 10 hours daily while also doing her household chores.\r\n\r\nThe most complicated part of this business is when the sows are pregnant because they require intensive care so that the piglets will be born in good condition and not be squashed.  Nancy needs a loan now to continue growing in her business for she\u2019ll use it to build new pigsties in order to house more pigs and increase sales thus improving her and her family\u2019s standard of living as well as to take a step towards reaching her dream of building her own house with quality infrastructure as well as having a pig farm with the optimal conditions for their care.\r\n\r\nNancy thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for the support the micro-loan provides and for the personalized counseling she receives from them; she also thanks Kiva for having confidence in her micro-enterprise.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":217.92,"image":{"id":1436510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build more pigsties.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-09-21T18:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-21T18:40:12Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700.52,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":54.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":56.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":58.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.97,"local_amount":46.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":47.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856357,"comment":null},{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":53.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":55.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059937,"comment":null},{"amount":114.9,"local_amount":111.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":114.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995266,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T13:43:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610792,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La familia de Jos\u00e9 Luis se ha dedicado por muchos a\u00f1os a la producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 as\u00ed que desde peque\u00f1o \u00e9l se vio involucrado en esta actividad al lado de sus padres.

His father is provided with a retirement pension, while the family is involved in agricultural activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith their cow and two calves, the family produces cheese for selling. David works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize and nut trees. His high-quality products are sold to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, David decided to start a transportation business. He sought credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions.

The members of this Communal Bank engage in different businesses such as knitting sweaters, weaving blankets, managing a neighborhood store, knitting mittens, selling vegetables, selling coffee, selling pots, knitting caps, manufacturing sportswear, and selling meat.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will benefit small businesswomen such as Sra. Justina.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer a year ago after receiving an invitation from a friend who is a member of the organization.  Justina currently has a business of selling meat.  She gained knowledge about this business after learning the trade from her aunt, who taught her how to sell meat.  Later on, she decided to venture on her own and has been in business now for 15 years.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying meat.  She acquires her inventory in bulk at the traditional fairs in the Department of La Paz and then sells her products from her retail space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to support her family.  Justina is widowed and has four children.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Justina said that she enjoys the loans and the group unity.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2087.72,"image":{"id":1434348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat to sell.

He currently lives with his wife. They married in 1981 and had 4 children, all of which are now adults (3 male and one female). The three men emigrated to the United States 15 years ago because of the situation in his country and a general lack of opportunities.\r\n\r\nMr. Cruz worked all his youth, 33 years, improving the roads of the country, until his retirement in 2001. He grew up with his parents and had a brother. They grew up working in agriculture (growing corn, sorghum and beans). Cruz now works full time in agriculture, growing basic staples (corn, sorghum and beans). From a young age his parents taught him very important values in life, how to lead a good path [in life], and how to work the fields. His fields are 1 km away from his home, so he has to walk through the hills and paths in order to reach them. During all of his life he has also formed part of the church in his community, where he goes almost every afternoon after his work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy cement, sand and iron, and to hire labor, since he needs to improve a corridor in his home.

They always have high quality products which are sold to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Zurab decided to start his own business and seek credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor standard of living. The Start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program in order to get a loan of $5,000. With the loan, he will purchase a tractor and will get orders to cultivate land. In the region, almost every family runs an agricultural business and they have to hire a tractor to cultivate the land.  As such, Zurab will have clients and hopes that the business will be successful. With support of the Start-up program Zurab will get an opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle financial difficulties."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1431470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a tractor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bolokiani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-09-22T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-22T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zurab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608111,"name":"Maureen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maureen is a 22 year old youth from Biafra area in Majengo slums, Nairobi.

is 58 years old and married. He lives with his wife in the Lagodekhi district of East Georgia. His wife is a housekeeper. \r\n\r\nAvtandil is involved in agricultural activities. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing cabbages, cucumbers, and eggplants. He always has high-quality products, which he sells to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Avtandil decided to start a transportation business.  He sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because he was considered too poor.  The start-up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. \r\n\r\nAvtandil's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of US$ 5,000.  He will use the money to purchase a truck to begin his transportation business. He plans to begin trading with fruits and vegetables seasonally. When there's no harvest, especially in winter time, he will get orders to transport cargo to different destinations. So he will use the truck to have stable income. \r\n\r\nThis will give him the chance to improve his family's living conditions and also to expand his agricultural business with the increased income. The new business initiative will give Avtandil the chance to have financial stability and monthly income."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1431476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

He lives in the Rustavi district with his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law. Both of his sons work at a distribution company and get a small monthly income. Emzar is not employed nowadays. \r\n\r\nIn the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self employment helps inhabitants to make living. Because of that, Emzar decided to start own business; however, the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers when they request a loan. Emzar's credit requests were rejected several times as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. Emzar was able to receive credit in the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, a startup program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

Her husband died a while ago, which has made it more difficult and tiring, yet not impossible, to be able to give her children everything that they need.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn could only study until the third grade.  The support she received from her parents during her youth was not the best, and her parents' financial situation allowed them to cover only the home expenses.  However, she is grateful to them for their efforts to ensure that she could at least begin her studies.\r\n\r\nShe makes a living performing domestic chores, and she also has a small parcel of land where she cultivates her coffee crops.  She learned this practice when she was very young, thanks to her parents who were farmers.  Her family members are farmers through generation and tradition.  Evelyn's greatest challenge is not the competition she faces, but the need for an excellent production and coffee crop at the moment of the harvest.  This allows her to be able to generate an income for her family and home.\r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting financing so that she is able to give better and greater maintenance to her coffee crops.  She will buy 14 quintals of a specialized coffee fertilizer, 8 quintals of growth fertilizer, 12 quintals of a specific 18-46-0 formula fertilizer, and 9 quintals of urea.  \r\n\r\nHer goals and plans for the future are to buy more land while she can, cultivate more coffee, and little by little, build up the inheritance so that her children have land where they can work, build their homes, and face economic difficulties in a favorable manner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1436768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies in order to maintain her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-22T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-22T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyn Xiomara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T17:56:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608269,"name":"Mekar Sandat Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Mekar Sandat group choose a new head, Ni Komang.

His wife also works on the couple's farm (she plants vegetables) and is the mother three of Faustino's four children, who are ages ten, eight, and three. Faustino has another child, an adult daughter who works in a hotel, and her two children also live with Faustino and his wife. The couple's farm is one kilometer from his home, so he can walk there and generally spends all day working at the farm. \r\n\r\nFaustino has grown vegetables (chile, tomatoes, chayote squash, green beans) for the past 14 years and provides for his family with the income from his farm. Faustino has always been a farmer, and he only planted corn and beans until he began to grow a greater variety of crops. Faustino learned to farm because several organizations conducted agricultural programs in his community that were designed to make crops more marketable.  \r\n\r\nFaustino is applying for a loan to purchase three liters of herbicide, three liters of insecticide, two liters of foliage manure, and to pay five people who will help him adapt the fields where he plants crops. The loan is an opportunity for Faustino to boost his harvest and his income, which will mean a better quality of life for his family. The loan funds will allow Faustino to purchase the farming supplies he needs all at once and at cheaper prices. \r\n\r\nOne of Faustino's ambitions is to adapt part of his farm and make it suitable for installing an irrigation system. Irrigation would allow him to plant crops throughout the dry season and make his farm more productive than it is now. Dry-season planting would alleviate the financial shortfalls that Faustino has experienced. Faustino's income will allow him to plan how much to invest for the next planting season. This loan is thus a smart investment that will allow Faustino to reach his goals.    \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1436799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase three liters of herbicides, three liters of insecticide, 2 liters of foliage manure, two quintals of formula, and to pay five people to adapt the fields where he plants crops.

Her previous loan was a big help in her business, as she was able to buy more frozen products for her business. She has been in this business for four years. Her business income is helpful with their everyday household expenditures, and also with the education of her children. She would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan to pay for additional stocks of frozen foods, such as hot dogs, tocino (sweetened cured pork), ham and other products needed in her business. Having more items to sell will result in better profits. Her business profits will definitely help her to cover her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. Evangeline hopes that her business will grow, and she dreams of giving her children a good life and education.

She is a woman who has endured some hard knocks in life. At a very tender age her biological parents gave her to strangers, who are now her adoptive parents. They were very strict with her and decided not to let her study so she could take care of the housework. At 15 she moved with her family to the city, where she started to work in a pottery studio, something she has done most of her life. With time she developed a disease that came from the making of these handicrafts, which separated her from her only source of income. At 27 years of age she met the person who would become her husband. They lived together for 22 years. Unfortunately he passed away in 2010. She was left alone as it was no longer possible to have children.

The eldest is graduating this year as public accountant and the others are in elementary school. She and her husband work in the fields growing coffee. She learned to work the land from her parents, as her family have been farmers for generations. They gave her the land that she and her husband currently work, which is 100 meters from the house where she lives. She finished the sixth grade and works hard every day so that her children will have the opportunity that she did not when she was young because of her family's lack of economic resources and the limited options for continuing her studies.\r\n\r\nShe is therefore requesting a loan so she can buy agricultural supplies for her coffee crop and prepare for the next harvest, which she hopes will be a good one, since coffee is her only source of income for paying for her children's schooling, clothing and feeding them, and covering other things they need. She plans to tend her crops by buying supplies so she can increase her yield and take full advantage of the harvest. This will bolster her family's finances and help her support her children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":113.21,"image":{"id":1436830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies to help her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-09-22T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-22T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Icelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":766.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833686,"comment":null},{"amount":38.16,"local_amount":763.12,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":780.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042152,"comment":null},{"amount":37.55,"local_amount":750.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":767.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-24T18:37:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608359,"name":"Nora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora is a married parent with four children, two of whom are in school.
