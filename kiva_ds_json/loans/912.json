Three years ago, she added an internet caf\u00e9 and, slowly, other related services, with which she has prospered in the market.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are her neighbors. She also offers merchandise that she buys wholesale to local shops and other businesses that have become steady customers. Ruby is courageous and strives daily to do a good job, which means her store opens at 8 a.m. and often doesn't close until 10 p.m. Still, she hopes to increase her income to keep improving her circumstances and, therefore, is requesting a loan to buy groceries, small appliances, and supplies for her internet caf\u00e9 and to buy another computer. The loan will increase her working capital, giving her the money to buy highly discounted merchandise when the opportunity arises. This is precisely the reason for Kiva credit's success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1151686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to

She is engaged in \"Kalamay making\" for more than twenty years now. \"Kalamay\" is made by extracting coconut milk from grated coconuts twice. Glutinous rice is added to the first batch of coconut milk and the mixture is ground into a paste. Brown sugar is added to the second batch of coconut milk and boiled for several hours to make sweetened coconut paste or latik. The mixture of ground glutinous rice and coconut milk is then poured into the lat\u00edk and stirred until the consistency becomes very thick.

In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.

Agriculture is carried on, especally the growing of cotton, corn and other crops. As well, beautiful beaches are found there, and above all, the inhabitants are very friendly. \r\n\r\nJose is a single father. Due to problems that had nothing to do with him, his wife left him, and he had to raise his three children on his own. He has really struggled to give them a decent life, and above all, so that they will be better off that he is.\r\n\r\nJose previously worked in construction jobs, but due to the fact that they were not one right after the after, he didn't have sufficient income. With a great deal of effort, and thanks to a friend's help, he got work in a stable. Currently, he works in that stable feeding the animals that are raised there. \r\n\r\nAs well, he milks the cows for milk sales. He does cleaning and looks after the animals, and also supervises the measuring of what is obtained from the milking. He is very at ease with his work, and believes that it is going well because he is responsible and has the desire to succeed.\r\n\r\nJose is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as with the support he has been offered, he will be able to buy a stove, pots and some necessary furniture for his home. Due to a small accident he was left without a home, and the stable owner has offered him a small room so that he can live there with his family.

To continue production he would like to increase his workshop's physical space and invest in the purchase of pedal looms and in raw materials such as wool.\r\n\r\nAlberto has been selling through NOVICA since 2004. This is his story:\r\n\r\nAlberto is the fourth generation in a family dedicated to weaving Zapotec rugs. \"I remember as a child watching my father working on the loom while my mother and grandmother carded and dyed the wool so that the men could weave it. We shear the wool, spin it and dye it with natural dyes from cochineal insects, pomegranate peels, and bark from huajal, oak and pecan trees. Almost all the rocks and flowers here yield natural colors that we can use in our work.  Words fail me to express how your support and trust make me feel.

He has been a farmer since he was a child, since in the place where he lives agriculture is the most represented sector. He learned the trade from his father, whom he helped all his life to grow crops to put bread on the table. Now that he has founded his own home, together with his wife and child, he has to work very hard in order to feed his family. Audelio has also reared pigs for about ten years, something which he also learned from his father, who keeps doing this to this day. They used to do it together but now each has their own pigs. Audelio says that this part of his activity helps a lot to increase his income, since cultivating his land is not enough to give his wife and child the good life they deserve. He buys the products he uses in a nearby town, some eight kilometres from his house; sometimes, he has to do this journey on foot, since transport to the area where his house is located is scarce. When he is loaded with products, he has no choice but to hire a vehicle to take him back to his house, and this is an extra cost, more expensive than walking. He will invest the loan in the purchase of five pigs and meal to feed them. He buys five pigs because it is cheaper and thus he can turn a good profit when he sells the carcases. Then he can buy more and bring more income to his family. The main need this loan fulfils is to enable Audelio to buy more than one pig and to buy meal at the same time: in so doing, he saves money, since he only has to pay for one trip to bring everything home. His life will be greatly improved by this, since he will turn a greater profit when selling the meat, giving him more money with which to buy more products and put more bread on the table. In the future, he plans to repair his home with what money he can save from the profits he will have made; he also hopes to give his daughter a good education and guidance, since he hopes she will have a better life than what he himself had to live through when he was a child. He is very grateful for Kiva's help, since it will enable him to carry out his plans sooner than expected."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1151786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy five

She lives in the town of Cartagena and she has a 25-year-old daughter and she hopes her daughter will be successful in whatever she will undertake. 17 years ago she worked in a fish processing plant for 7 months only because that job was very difficult; notwithstanding this, while looking for job opportunities she was offered a stall and she accepted it to generate some business and to earn money to support her family, composed of her mother and her daughter. This is how she started selling meals and beers, succeeding in gaining some customers whose number has been growing little by little, and this went on for 4 years; however, once she was positioned she was robbed and she had to start in another neighborhood, on a plot of land provided by a friend of hers where she installed a roof, chairs and tables in order to start her activity once again. As her activity was growing she took on her sister and she succeeded in positioning her activity and in saving enough to buy another plot of land that she arranged in order to succeed in having her own house. She then had to hand in the place her shop was located in, and for this reason she had to adapt her own plot of land, opening a restaurant; she then added soft drinks and beer selling, and later on she added liquor selling as well. She will then add a terrace to transform it in a place where her customers can enjoy themselves dancing and to have some fun together. This activity is her only source of income, thanks to which she has progressed as a woman at the head of her household. She has a 12-years\u2019 experience and she is ready to make her activity grow a little more.

The representative of the group, Madina, is the woman raising her hand in the photo. Madina is 38 years old and is married to a man named Arouna. Madina did not attend school. The couple has three children under their charge, some of whom are in school. Madina lives with her husband and children. The couple share the various household responsibilities. To meet the various household needs of the family, Madina has sold food (corn, cassava root flour, and oil) for ten years in a B\u00e9nin market.

Her business is located in one of the markets in Chinandega.  She is the mother of five children: the oldest is 22 years old and the youngest is 8.  Three of them are in school, so she works from Monday to Sunday from eight in the morning until five in the afternoon in order to raise and educate them.\r\n\r\nHer business was started by her husband who is still living and who is the father of her five chilren.  She works making pinatas.  She started this activity on her own, after having watched how pinatas were made and trying to make one, but it did not turn out well.  However, she did not give up, and kept trying until she made a good one. She never went to school to learn how to make a pinata because her family was large and there was no opportunity.  All of her children have followed her example, and make dozens of pinatas every week.  These pinatas are made with a large earthen jar, which is covered with newspapers using the hands, legs and head. They are left to dry for three or four days before being dressed as cartoon characters.  These pinatas are for children's birthday celebrations.  They are filled with many candies, and when it is time to break them the children are given a stick.

In thinking about her child, she decided to sells food to have a stable household and be able to give more attention to her child. Now she had been doing this for two years. She mentions that one challenge in her business happens when the price of supplies rises because she has to increase the price of her products. \r\n\r\nLast year she requested a loan of 10,000 Lempiras, which she used to purchase a kitchen pot to make her soups. She has seen a big change in her business and up to now it has gone very well for her. She paid off her loan without any problems and saved some to continue investing. Now she is requesting this second loan for 13,000 Lempiras to complete the purchase of new implements like kitchen utensils to make her meals as she has been offered a cafeteria storefront where she will be able to better establish the business and make sales during the week. Her plan for the moment is to increase sales and the family income.

She has been working commercially for 6 years and generating income to help support the household, which consists of her husband and her 12 year old son.\r\n\r\nShe began with products made from silver, distributing them on credit among neighbors and referrals. And so little by little she generated profit and she was taking new orders for other articles such as cologne, cosmetics and recently working with vitamins and natural products, that a relative sends her from abroad. Her customers are mainly housewives, company employees and the domestic help of her neighbors, which is ongoing. Sales take place by monthly preorders she collects. She also buys articles in the nearby city of Barranquilla and in the Cartagena market square, paying by cash.\r\n\r\nShe has received 2 loans through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which have noticeably increased her working capital and profits, so on a personal level she has achieved greater autonomy and overcome fears in respect to the sales of the products that she offers and therefore she gives thanks to God.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to purchase products in larger quantities in order to get better prices and transfer the savings on to her customers, and upon receiving her earnings, rotating her merchandise each time. Her goal moving forward is to have a facility in her own home, which she doesn\u2019t have yet.\r\n\r\nThis is her third Kiva loan for which she is applying through the foundation and with this investment she plans to buy a display case and supply it with silverware and cologne from North America in which her customers can find a good mixture. Once Luz Marina has a new display case, it will have an impact in the long view once again, her market and most likely her profits will double and this is what guarantees the success of Kiva

","en":"Rubis is 38 years old and is a mother of 3 children between the ages of 7 and 13. With the income from her hardware store, she is able to support her home and strives daily to provide for the welfare of her children. Rubis grew up in a home where she was taught good manners. She also grew in a work environment which influenced her life, understanding that to get ahead she had to be productive. Because of this, when she put together her home once she finished high school and was left without her partner, she initiated an entrepreneurial development. First a friend provided her with goods like bags and footwear. With these she generated earnings with which she was able to move forward for a bit. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 her family was reorganized. By taking advantage of the father of her child's work experience with hardware, she began her own business of this nature and was supported by him to manage the hardware products. This work has gone very well for her because her customer base continues to grow. Her greatest challenge is having the store completely stocked with all of the items that her customers need to buy. This is justly the reason for which she seeks a Kiva loan. This is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will buy cement paint, taking advantage of the rise that construction has made in the surrounding neighborhoods and the fact that there are not businesses like hers to compete with her. Her dream for the future is to have a vehicle for transportation from her business and to transport her children with ease.

She has an internet caf\u00e9 in her home and offers video games and internet services and also sells stationary items, sweets, and soft drinks. She started this business in 2006, when her husband was let go from a job at an important business in the city. She received help from many people who were supportive of her. A friend, who had closed his own internet caf\u00e9, helped her out with two televisions and a Playstation. Also, a family member bought two televisions on credit, and with this equipment, she began her business. Her customer base grew every day, and Luz added sweets and soft drinks when an important business provided her with a refrigerator. Little by little, her business grew and good things happened in her home. Her husband took advantage of his knowledge of medicines and opened up his own pharmacy business in another part of town. Luz now has 5 computers, 12 televisions, 6 X-Boxes, 5 Playstations, and a vitrine. She also has a good client base, due to her good customer service and her strategic location. Her goal for the future is to expand her business by building a second floor, so she can separate her family\u2019s space from her business space. In order to achieve this, she works without rest, from Monday through Sunday. Her greatest motivation is her 2 children, who are 6 and 10 years old, and whom she wants to see become successful and have a good life. She is currently requesting a loan, which she will use to buy stationary items, sweets, and soft drinks. She will also use it to do some maintenance on her equipment, so that she can continue to have a successful business that her customers will be loyal to and help her achieve her

profesional del dise\u00f1o. Desde sus 15 a\u00f1os ha estado trabajando muy cerca a confeccionistas y desde hace un a\u00f1o, despu\u00e9s de ser empleada decidi\u00f3 independizarse, dando inicio a su sue\u00f1o de convertirse en dise\u00f1adora de modas, aplicando el dinero recibido, producto de haber terminado su contrato de trabajo y su carrera como profesional del dise\u00f1o. Su meta es lanzar una colecci\u00f3n de ropa casual para damas y es por esto que requiere el apoyo de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n en la cual est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el que planea  invertir en materias primas e insumos para dar su primer paso hacia el mundo competitivo del dise\u00f1o y apostarle a su reconocimiento y posicionamiento en un mercado mucho mas estructurado. En la actualidad Magda tiene un taller, donde realiza todo el proceso productivo, desde la compra de materias primas, pasando por el dise\u00f1o, corte, preparaci\u00f3n, ensamble y acabado de piezas, hasta la comercializaci\u00f3n. Su principal mercado son los j\u00f3venes universitarios y ejecutivas de empresas que est\u00e1n convencidas de la calidad de los productos que Magda ofrece. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y sus compras de contado y su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para sacar su colecci\u00f3n y en por eso Magda trabaja de manera esmerada, diariamente desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde y de lunes a domingo; su capacidad de trabajo, disciplina y la calidad de lo que produce, son las fortalezas con las que le sale al paso, a una inmensa competencia en el mercado y por eso se sostiene. Esto es justamente el \u00e9xito de invertir un credikiva en su negocio, pues est\u00e1 en buenas manos. ","en":"For Magda the clothes making and high fashion business is the visible result of her creative expression as a design professional. Since she was 15 years old, she has been working very closely with seamstresses. A year ago, after being an employee, she decided to go off on her own to follow her dream of being a fashion designer. She used the money she had from terminating her work contract and from her career as a design professional. Her goal is to start a collection a casual clothing for women and that is why she needs support from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, the organization where she is applying for a Kiva loan. With it, she plans on investing in raw materials to take the first step towards the competitive world of design and gain recognition and position in a much more structured market. Right now, Magda has a workshop where she does the whole productive process, from buying raw materials to design, cutting, preparation, assembly and finishing the pieces, and then selling them. Her main market are young college students and business executives who are persuaded by the quality of the products that Magda offers. She sells on credit and pays for her purchases up front. Her biggest challenge is having enough working capital to make her collection, and that is why she works so hard.

She has two sons, both of whom are still dependent on her. The main source of her family's income is from cassava planting on one hectare of farmland, which she has been doing for several years to make a living. She can earn approximately 20,000 Cambodia Riels (KHR) per day and she manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after daily expenses. The low price of cassava output is the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Saven and one other member with VisionFund, while the other one is just starting with VisionFund.

42-year-old Isatu from Kulanda town Southern area in Bo. She is married with 6 children between the ages of 13 years and 25 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. In 1995, Isatu established her dried fish business. She began her business because her parent taught her the business; her mother was once a fish seller. She works at the business 12 hours a day and 7 day per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is during rainy season when there is a scarcity of fish.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more dried fish. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to expand her business. In the future, Isatu plans to export fish.

is a 30-year-old married woman and a mother of three young children from Bohol, Philippines. She has been running a mini-grocery store for more than two years now. This venture is the source of their income.\r\n\r\nBenvenida needs funds for her business to grow and expand. She is applying for a loan worth 12,000 PHP to buy additional merchandise to sell like canned goods, rice, bread and snack foods to sell to the people in their community.
