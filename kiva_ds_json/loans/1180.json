Set up to help girls and women deal with their period in a dignified, affordable way, the company was distinctive in that it manufactures reusable sanitary pads in Uganda rather than importing them.  \n\nCurrently, AFRIpads employs over 40 local Ugandan women from rural areas who are pivotal both in the manufacturing process, and ultimately responding to the needs of girls who could not afford sanitary pads and were missing school during their periods. \n\nThese women live in a small village called Kitengeesa about 3 hours\u2019 drive from Kampala, which is off-grid with only basic facilities. With no access to power, they risk respiratory problems, fires and burns by depending on kerosene lamps for lighting in their homes and have to pay for their mobile phones to be charged which is a high cost luxury for them given the limited power supply.\n\nAFRIpads approached Fenix International, a renewable energy company, to help provide their employees with access to clean, safe and affordable lighting plus empower them to generate additional income from phone charging. Fenix designs and manufacturers the ReadySet Solar Charger, a high quality, easy to use solar system that comes with a 15watt solar panel and provides up to 30 hours of lighting or charge up to 10 phones a day. The ReadySet allows a household to generate income of up to $50 per month by charging phones and generating savings by removing the need to purchase kerosene. They ReadySet is also capable of providing reliable energy to power other devices such as radios and hair clippers. \n\nGorreth, an AFRIpad employee (pictured with her light and also shown with her fellow employees), has been testing the ReadySet Solar Charger in her small shop in the village, which she runs next to her AFRIpads job. With the new light, she has been able to keep her shop open for longer in the evening, helping her sell even more products plus she now makes additional income from offering phone charging to the village community for a small fee. She lives in her shop as well and having a light will make her life safer, so much so, she wants to buy one for her parents as well. \n\nThanks to Kiva, Fenix will be able to supply their ReadySet Solar Charger on loan to AFRIpads\u2019 employees, who can pay on affordable monthly installments over a year-long period. Payments are deducted directly from their pay slips each month, leaving them with profits and savings generated from the ReadySet Solar Charger to help improve their lives. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1165.38,"image":{"id":1398431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To access clean, reliable, solar energy for AFRIpad employees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":214,"posted_date":"2013-08-01T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-31T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afripads","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6480000.02,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":498461.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":388.46,"local_amount":996923.08,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":999489.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399812452,"comment":null},{"amount":388.46,"local_amount":996923.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":999489.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411584932,"comment":null},{"amount":194.23,"local_amount":498461.54,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-03T10:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":499744.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420565697,"comment":null},{"amount":194.23,"local_amount":498461.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":499744.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429502832,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-02T04:17:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588905,"name":"Cornerstone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nTeachers and workers at the Cornerstone organization in Uganda have dedicated themselves to giving under privileged youths the opportunity to turn their lives around, providing them with skills and capabilities they need to participate in society as independent, mature, and responsible individuals.\n\nEmployees at Cornerstone such as Peninah, a 29 year old and a single mother of one child, earns $120 a month and is able to take care of her child and obtain basic needs for home.

There are several touristic places to visit in this canton, such as rivers and forests, as well as craftmanship exhibitions and shows with agricultural products and livestock during their festivity. These activities combined with the trade business have brought the opportunity for private businesses to build hotels, restaurants and other services for tourists. However, agriculture and livestock are the main activities of the canton and allow the economic performance indicator to improve each year despite the limited use of technology in the area. \r\n\r\nMirella helped to breed animals in her house when she was very young. Now that she lives with her partner, she can use some space in their field to breed pigs and sell them in the canton's tradeshow. She devotes several hours each day to this activity and hopes to expand the storehouses and provide the pigs with a better care. She is requesting a loan to capitalize her business with a goal to see her son becoming a professional. \r\n\r\nMirella has joined a group of entrepreneurs like herself who work in similar businesses: Merly, 28 years old, sells chickens during the weekends; Digna, 23 years old, breeds pigs for retail sale; and Jos\u00e9, 38 years old, works full time breeding chicken for retail and wholesale. Together they have applied and obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. They are very grateful to Kiva and lenders for their support.

His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $4000 for constructing the greenhouse.

She is applying for the water and sanitation project, through which she will use the loan to improve the bathroom in her home, since it lacks ideal conditions. She needs to purchase a toilet, sink, water connections and a garbage disposal, as well as pay for labor, because she knows the importance of improving her home's sanitation. Through this program, her family has access to a project benefiting a number of towns in the country, allowing people to improve their quality of life and protect the environment. These programs are helping families who live in very poor conditions and use latrines, which cause sickness and contaminate the surrounding area. That is why these projects are needed in the most vulnerable areas of the country."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.08,"image":{"id":1401649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase a toilet, sink, water connections, a garbage disposal and to pay for labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-08-02T04:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-01T04:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Olimpia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14065,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.04},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":586.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.96,"local_amount":586.04,"processed_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":596.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399789133,"comment":null},{"amount":23.96,"local_amount":586.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":596.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065444,"comment":null},{"amount":23.95,"local_amount":586.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":596.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829326,"comment":null},{"amount":11.09,"local_amount":271.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":276.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430385097,"comment":null},{"amount":23.12,"local_amount":565.61,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-20T09:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":575.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978800,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T20:21:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":588801,"name":"Ma.

located in the Sogdian Oblast in the north of Tajikistan.  Khojmahmad is 54 years old and he is married with a large family.  He is the father of seven children - six daughters and one son.  He has a higher education and for a few years he has worked in a government office of his district, a \"djamoat\" (from the Arabic \"djamaa\" - society, group, community).  Every village in the region has a djamoat (smaller regions), and the djamoats are in the villages.\r\n\r\nKhojmahmad is also involved in agricultural work.  He has a private farm, a \"dekhkanskoe,\" where his wife helps him grow his crops.

She has five years experience in trade. Previously, she worked as a salesclerk in store. Now, she intends to open her own grocery store. Next to her home, Zeboniso has built a construction for a store. Left to her now is only to purchase goods and to start the business. To that end, Zeboniso requested a loan. With the loan, she wants to buy a diverse assortment of food products, specifically butter, sugar, tea, cookies, chocolate, pasta, sausage products, dairy products, etc. \r\n\r\nShe believes that her business will be quite successful as there is not in their area such a big grocery store that offers so much variety. And besides that, Zeboniso will bring only quality and fresh products. Zeboniso knows that her goal will be realized only with

She is married and is raising three children. Her husband is engaged in agriculture and receives a small income. This income is not sufficient to support the family with all its needs. \r\n\r\nRavshanoy decided to help her husband for the well-being of the family. To this end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. Now, she is fully capable of establishing her own business and becoming successful in this sphere. She wants to organize a business buying and selling livestock, as she has experience in this type of work.

For many years, Zuurakhan has been involved in agriculture and raising livestock, starting this business with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS). Monthly income from livestock is 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to hard work, Zuurakhan today has on her homestead: 1 dairy cow, 1 calf, 5 sheep, and 6 goats. Her spouse helps with the farm. Her son is working abroad in Russia. He helps his parents materially, sending them his salary. Zuurakhan also has her own retail outlet where she sells food products. This brings about 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her homestead, Zuurakhan turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow for fattening and resale.\r\n\r\nZuurakhan plans to invest income from the loan to further increasing the number of livestock, and in the future to purchase a

He\u2019s spent his entire life in the countryside where he learned agriculture and animal husbandry activities from his father.  He currently works in agriculture growing peas, beans, potatoes and corn.  To earn income he sells his crops in the town square where he lives.  In this way he\u2019s succeeded in moving his children and wife forward.  \r\n\r\nJaime is a very hardworking, active, driven man who is passionate about his family and his work.  He\u2019s always in search of options that will lead to progress.  Because of this, he\u2019s requested a loan to buy five calves (cattle-raising) because he wants to alternate cattle-raising with his current agricultural work.

Through this she has been able to help her husband to improve their family economy.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy a display case for candy. One of the goals of Crecencia is to expand her business. The group thanks the Kiva investors for the loan.
