It is made up of 17 entrepreneurs who makes their livings in different lines of work including clothing sales, wood sales, firewood sales, jewelry, perfumes, loaf bread and services, among others.  They all live in the city of Talca.\r\nClaudia, the representative of the communal bank, is in the first row of the photo.  She is the third from the left, wearing a white jacket with pink trim and has light brown hair worn in a ponytail. \r\nClaudia makes her living baking, making cushions and making bathroom curtains.  She says that she works with others making the cushions, which she does from Monday to Sunday.  And in the afternoons, she sells her baked goods, specifically cakes, and \"calzones roto\" (a Chilean sweet made of fried dough.  It uses flour, baking powder, powdered sugar and eggs and is usually served in the wintertime).  Claudia's work schedule is divided according to her availability.  She purchases her merchandise from supermarkets and wholesalers that offer everything she needs for her baked goods, cushions and curtains at low cost, which makes it economically advisable. \r\nWith this loan, Claudia will make purchases for her baked goods, specifically flour, eggs, oil, sugar and margarine.\r\nClaudia's goal is to get even better at making the cushions and curtains, as she hasn't been doing it for as long.\r\nClaudia lives with her 9-year old daughter.  Her dream for her personal life is to finish school, as she was only able to attend through her eighth year of primary school.\r\nClaudia is very happy about and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza has offered her to invest in her business.  In addition, she feels very comfortable with the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank; they share with each other their different businesses and interests.\r\nTalca belongs the Maule Region, which is located in Chile's central zone.  It constitutes the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region.  It is the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a funny saying in Chile about Talca, the phrase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres.\"  (Talca, Paris and London).  Among the rumors, it is said that the phrase is a derivation of one originally said by an Englishman \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca seems like London) because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in wintertime, just like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":1146858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Entre sus clientes principales est\u00e1n compa\u00f1eras de la iglesia, en la cual participa, vecinos y referidos por estas. Tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00eda especialmente cosm\u00e9ticos, que es la l\u00ednea que mas rota en su negocio. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y muchas veces de contado y recupera su dinero semanal, quincenal, mensual, de acuerdo con lo pactado con su cliente.

She got her business experience eight years ago by selling various merchandise by order to friends and referred customers.\r\n\r\nWith her business activity she managed to get savings, and she took a sewing course.  She later entered the world of fashion by organizing her workshop in the place where she lives.  She offers individual sewing services according to the style, fashion, and size that her customers select.  Among her main customers are her colleagues at the church she attends, neighbors, and referrals.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells merchandise, especially cosmetics, which is the line that turns over the most in her business.  She makes her sales on credit, and many times for cash.  She collects her money weekly, biweekly, or monthly, according to the agreement with her customer.\r\n\r\nShe buys at warehouses specializing in fabrics and sewing supplies and from make-up providers from whom she gets competitive prices for being a good customer and for her cash purchases.  To the extent that her business is growing she does not have enough working capital to respond to her customers in a timely fashion because she works very hard and has a lot of cosmetic orders.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to extend herself in the market and to increase her working capital.  To do this she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy cosmetics, fabric, and supplies to make children\u2019s clothes.  She will also buy cosmetics in order to respond to new customers.\r\n\r\nHilda puts great effort into her work every day.

En la actualidad Isabel ha recibido dos financiamientos de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con los cuales les ha ido muy bien, pues ha logrado el mejoramiento de la calidad reflejada en su infraestructura educativa. Hoy planea hacer su primer credikiva con el que comprara una reja para estructurar la recreaci\u00f3n segura de los ni\u00f1os que son su principal tesoro.

In the beginning she sold merchandise by order, and by doing so she was able to advance in her professional career as a pre-school teacher. \r\n\r\nOnce she finished her studies three years ago, she began her dream of having an educational center dedicated to early childhood, as she now has achieved.  In her private nursery school she devotes herself to pre-school students during the morning schedule.\r\n\r\nHer main customers are parents who have confidence in Isabel\u2019s good educational work.  They pay punctually every month.\r\n\r\nIsabel has now received two loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. They have gone very well for her.  She has managed to improve, which can be seen in the quality of her educational infrastructure.\r\n\r\nShe now plans her first Kiva loan.  She will use the loan to buy a  fence to make the recreation area safe for the children, who are her foremost treasure.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to manage to have her business activity completely separate from the site of her home.  For this dream she needs to get her own house.  The best part is that we are sure that later on she will manage to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1069.55,"image":{"id":1145587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

This will allow her to provide comfort and better service to her customers, which will lead to increased profits. The reason she took out the loan is to continue improving her business. She will use the benefits that come from the loan to continue buying utensils and ingredients needed to make her \"empanadas\". Wilma is a very hard working woman. She is thankful for the opportunity that has been given to her and her fellow group members, as it is common that they are the only ones supporting their families.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1146951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy tables and chairs for their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2012-07-25T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-24T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":4175,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Wilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1661.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1915.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1914.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1949.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1985.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2021.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2058.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2095.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2172.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2212.03},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2252.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2293.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2335.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":301.69},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":324.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":330.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":336.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451700,"name":"Heisen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Heisen tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es un hombre empe\u00f1oso y trabajador, adem\u00e1s de tener muchas ganas de salir adelante.

Her main challenges are the drought that made her crop fruitless and the lack of working capital for her current business. To tackle these challenges, she forms a group of four to apply for a new loan. This is the second cycle for Thyn and another group member, and the first cycle for the remaining two members. Thyn has repaid the entire loan of the first cycle from VisionFund already and she has managed to have a decent house and set aside some money for future needs. She and the other three members are applying for 1,000,000 KHR each. She, as the leader, is going to use her portion to buy fertilizers and pay the harvesting fee for her rice farm.

She has four children, one of whom still depends on her and is still in school. To strive for her family, Yim grows cassava on three hectares of farmland to generate income. She also earns extra minimal income as a doctor in the village. Having been with this business for 12 years, she currently can earn about 30,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is the microloan for Yim's group of two; Yim is a second-cycle client and the other member is a first-cycle client.

She grows cassava and paddy rice on two hectares of farmland each. She has been farming for the past 12 years; currently, she is able to earn about 16,000 KHR per day from her farms. \r\n\r\nPhally took her first loan with KIVA's partner VisionFund in 2011. The loan, which she completely paid back, has helped her to better support her big family. Now she leads a micro-loan group of two in requesting a new loan. Her requested amount is 1,400,000 KHR, and the other member is applying for 1,200,000 KHR. Phally is going to use her loan portion to buy seeds and fertilizers for her rice farm.

The leader of the group is Roxana, who's 32 years old and has two children aged 5 and 8. Roxana sells fruits that are in season. She has a regular stand in one of the busiest markets in the town of Santa Cruz, where she sells her products. This loan is her third one with the institution. Roxana will use this loan to purchase in-season fruits by wholesale, such as citrus fruit, in order to fight the winter. That way she'll provide a variety of fruits for her customers and increase her profits. The reason why she requests this loan is to keep on improving her business. Roxana will use the profits to continue buying various fruits according to the season. Roxana is a very hardworking person. She feels happy for the opportunity that she and her fellow group members are getting, since in some cases they support their families single-handedly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1147892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase in-season fruits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2012-07-26T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-25T00:30:01Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flabia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Leidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damiana  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2310.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2424.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2466.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2644.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2707.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2809.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2937.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.14},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":334.61,"local_amount":2310.72,"processed_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294319394,"comment":null},{"amount":351.11,"local_amount":2424.64,"processed_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2443.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301376129,"comment":null},{"amount":357.14,"local_amount":2466.3,"processed_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2485.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315370678,"comment":null},{"amount":382.91,"local_amount":2644.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2665.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315370679,"comment":null},{"amount":392.07,"local_amount":2707.51,"processed_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2728.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322979585,"comment":null},{"amount":406.8,"local_amount":2809.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2831.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331116674,"comment":null},{"amount":425.36,"local_amount":2937.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2960.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339508202,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T15:24:57Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:04:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454094,"name":"A\u00efssatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A\u00efssatou exerce un commerce de produits alimentaires.Elle tient une table au march\u00e9 de sa localit\u00e9 et propose \u00e0 ses clients divers produits.Cette activit\u00e9 lui permet de prendre en charge les d\u00e9penses d'entretien de ses trois enfants notamment les frais de scolarit\u00e9, de sant\u00e9 et les d\u00e9penses vestimentaires.Actuellement,elle sollicite un pret de 400 000f pour acheter des arachide, des haricots, des l\u00e9gumes et d'autres denr\u00e9es de consommation courante.\nElle ambitionne de construire une boutique pour \u00e9largir sa capacit\u00e9 de vente.","en":"A\u00efssatou has a business selling food products.

On her land she plants peas, beans, corn and potatoes which she sells in the wholesale market (20 minutes away). For this, she counts on the support of her eldest children and her husband.

Thanks to his experience and his reputation as a good business man, he has built up a large customer base over time, with demands that are increasing rapidly. Hence his problem of insufficient stock, which does not come close to allowing him to satisfy this demand and which is leading to a significant reduction in his customer numbers.\r\n\r\nHe is therefore requesting this loan in order to be able to restock on sufficient amounts of rice (bags), eggs (trays) and milk (cartons), which will help him to keep and satisfy his client\u00e8le properly, and will also increase his profits.

is Ali, who is 34 years old. He\u2019s married, and he lives in Lebanon with his wife Kawakeb, the mother of their two school-aged children. Ali is doing the best he can to support his family and offer them a suitable life. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Ali opened his own garage. He started work painting cars, attracting customers from all over the surrounding areas. \r\n\r\nEven though he earns an okay income, Ali suffers from a bad financial situation.

She has 3 children, aged 22, 20 and 18, for whom she provides both moral and economic support. For more than 10 years, she has worked in agriculture and ranching. For this reason she is requesting the loan to buy a milk cow, because with this she will be able to increase her income a little more and give her children a better life. Her husband's work is public transportation, but since his vehicle runs on gasoline, he doesn't have much net profit for his family. Since she was very young, the borrower worked in farming together with her parents, whom she continues to help with the planting and harvest of their crops. She is from a humble background and values what she has, since thanks to the effort and determination of herself and her husband, they have been able to get ahead and were able to build the little house where they currently live.

She currently has four bulls, six cows and sixty sheep.  For the quantity of cattle she has, she needs to plant grass in fields in order to feed them, but they also require a balanced diet, and so she needs to mix the grass with oats and other natural products. And as if this weren't enough, she also plants all kinds of varieties of potatoes, but she only does this once a year.

She was able to pay off the cost of the kiosk within several years and can now save by not paying lease.  Victoria has been involved in sales for over five years, has many clients, and her business is going well.  She is requesting this loan to expand her business.

children.  She works as a cook.  She lives together with her husband in their own home.  Olga is requesting a loan in the amount of 6000 hryvnia to replace windows at home.
