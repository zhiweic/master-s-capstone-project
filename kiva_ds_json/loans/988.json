years old and married with two children.  She raises livestock on her own farm and sells the animals herself.  As luck would have it, Makhsuda's husband left for the Russian Federation and sends the family some money each month, but it is not enough for the family to live on.  This is why Makhsuda wants to increase her livestock business.  She already makes a decent living from this work.  On receiving her loan, Makhsuda wants to buy livestock to increase the number of her herd.

village.  He is 41 years old and is married with five children.  His eldest son is still in school and his youngest child is in kindergarten.  Odiljon married late, as he was saving his own money for his wedding.  His wife is a homemaker and she takes care of the children.  Since 2005, Odiljon has been buying and selling small livestock.

is 46 years old. He lives in Khoni District with his 68-year-old mother (pensioner) and 29-year-old son. His son has chronic health problems and receives a pension from the local government. Koba requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but met no success. His loan request was rejected every time because of low income and poor family living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only current source of income for the family is from agricultural business. In particular, they have vineyard of 200 vine trees and produce vines to sell locally at good prices. Koba has 0.5 hectares of land where he sows different kinds of vegetables. In addition, the family has a calf. This is hardly enough food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKoba requested a loan from Credo to start-up another family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase a cow. After purchasing the cow, he will be able to produce dairy and milk products. This will significantly increase the family income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"The \"Accesorios Clemente\" [\"Clemente Accessories\"] group has been through three loan cycles with the institution, and they comment that they are very happy and grateful, since thanks to the loans they have grown a lot. Jes\u00fas is the group's representative. He is 28 years old and has lived in a common-law marriage with Josefina for 10 years. Together they have formed a family with three children, two of whom go to school. Jes\u00fas and Josefina have a family business selling auto accessories. They sell colored bulbs, decals, car deodorizers, steering wheels, floor mats, etc. This time they are requesting the loan to buy more products that they need, such as cables for the installation of their alarms. Jes\u00fas comments: \u201cPreviously I didn't know how to carry out the installation of the alarms, but I am taking classes to learn and to make progress with my business, since the difficulty that arose is not knowing how to manage my business, because I only started it recently, and I started it because my papa worked in this field.\" Jes\u00fas only has three years of experience with his business. Jes\u00fas' goal is to make his business grow, but he would also like it if in the future he could set up a new business near his home, because the space where he currently has his accessories business is only lent to him, and he has to pay the rent monthly, which is an expense for his family that he is obligated to pay. Within the group, Jessica also participates; she is Jes\u00fas' sister and operates a store.

She is requesting her second loan from GHAPE, which she will use to buy more drinks for her off license, which was opened with the help of the first loan. She will also buy more crates, bottles, and comfortable chairs and construct a counter to display her drinks.  She is positive that her business will succeed because she will offer all types of drinks. She has regular customers with a good business site and the community will benefit from the regular supply of drinks which is mostly consumed during ceremonies.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, Grace Lum will provide good food to her children and sponsor their education.

is a 44-year-old, hard-working man, living in Kagadi, Uganda. For twelve years he has been in the business of trading in agricultural products. With the loan facility, he has been able to pay school fees for his children and build a semi-permanent house for a residence. He started this business with capital he got from his livestock farm, and he is still in the business.

He notes that he started his business because his father was also engaged in cultivating nopal; that is how \u00c1ngel learned the business.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, he is requesting a loan in order to purchase two rolls of new oilcloth  in order to maintain his nopal plants and they will also serve to protect them from the ice that forms . Sudden temperature changes are one of the difficulties \u00c1ngel faces, which often cause his plants to be stunted or the loss of his crop altogether.\r\n\r\nDon \u00c1ngel notes that he usually works at his business all week; some days he goes to other towns to sell his crop and other days he can be found working in his greenhouse. He is sure that if he takes good care of his nopales, he will have good sales because the best seasons are approaching. He notes: \u201cMy greatest goal is that my sons will be hardworking men and that they will enjoy the fields and continue cultivating nopal so that the family business will not be lost.\r\n\r\nDon \u00c1ngel and the group in general are very grateful because this loan will be a great help to their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7075,"image":{"id":1229258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two rolls of oilcloth for his greenhouse..","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T17:00:47Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T17:00:47Z","loan_amount":7075,"lender_count":234,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicente ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":92000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":7075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":442.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1768.75,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":23019.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120100,"comment":null},{"amount":1768.75,"local_amount":23000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":23019.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068149,"comment":null},{"amount":2210.94,"local_amount":28750,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28774.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284887,"comment":null},{"amount":1326.56,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":17264.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199177,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T23:23:55Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492489,"name":"Marie Ngwen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie Ngwen is married and has seven children.

I like working with community people because they are responsible and even though they have no formal schooling they are respectful and kind people.\u201d  She\u2019s a member of a group called \u201cLas Azucenas de Pueblo Nuevo\u201d (Pueblo Nuevo Easter Lilies).  She says they decided on this name because the lady of the house they meet in has many of these flowers and the \u2018Pueblo Nuevo\u2019 part is because that\u2019s the name of their location.\r\n\r\nShe says that besides working mornings as a teacher, she also sells shoes, clothes and various brand cosmetics via catalogue in the afternoon.  She says she started this business to help her parents when she was a student since she studied in a city called Morelia which is the capital of the state of Michoac\u00e1n and to help her parents pay for her books and other supplies she needed she decided to start her own business.  She stocks up on merchandise at various authorized shoe, clothes and cosmetics distributors.\r\n\r\nThe other seven group members are: Alma, Gabriela, Marisela, Fabiola, Mar\u00eda Isabel, Irma and Adelina.

When he is at his job, his wife and son are left in the house the whole day. Sumiyadorj said that after leaving his family in the cold house, he can't concentrate on what he is doing. For this reason, before the winter he has a plan to insulate the house by using energy-saving materials like glass-wool, double-glazed windows and bricks. \r\n\r\nSumiyadorj started insulating his house but in the middle of the job, his materials were used up.

Aunque Don Andr\u00e9s ha sido siempre muy trabajador tiene la idea que en los tiempos en que vivimos no podemos aspirar a mucho ya que la econom\u00eda no est\u00e1 muy bien pero si tiene metas con su Familia tiene un hijo que esta por graduarse como veterinario y quieren poder una granja de animales donde el mismo sepa cuidarlos y al mismo pueda seguir prepar\u00e1ndose con mas ganas.","en":"Andr\u00e9s is a man who is always very busy with his work in his different businesses.  However, he is always very happy, and he always has a witty remark to make us laugh.  Andr\u00e9s, age 54, has been married to Lurdes for several years, and they are a family with four children.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s has a store selling hardware, construction materials, and a stationery items.  He also has a truck, which is used for trips that he needs to make.\r\n\r\nThis time he is requesting a loan to buy construction materials and more things for his hardware business like tubes, cables, screws, and brackets, etc.  He says that he started his business because he already had experience and a place to put his businesses.  The difficulty that occurs is when he gives his neighbors credit.  Many times they do not pay him, and this is a very big financial loss for Andr\u00e9s.  Even though he says that he does not give credit to just anybody, he generally gives credit to the people he knows.\r\n\r\nEven though Andr\u00e9s has always been very hard-working, he believes that during the times we are now living we cannot aspire to much because the economy is not very good.  However, he does have goals with his family.  He has a son who will soon graduate as a veterinarian.  They want to be able to have an animal farm where he, himself, knows how to take care of them.  At the same time he will continue getting ready very eagerly.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1228896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy construction materials and more things for his hardware business like tubes, cables, screws, and brackets, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Andres Del Pedregal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1097.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1123.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1149.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1176.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1203.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1231.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1260.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1289.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1320.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1350.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1382.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":173.96,"local_amount":2220.79,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2264.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120103,"comment":null},{"amount":182.18,"local_amount":2325.64,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2370.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068152,"comment":null},{"amount":211.78,"local_amount":2703.59,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2756.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284890,"comment":null},{"amount":200.77,"local_amount":2563.07,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2613,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199179,"comment":null},{"amount":334.31,"local_amount":4267.79,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4350.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595983,"comment":null},{"amount":72,"local_amount":919.12,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":937.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T21:10:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493108,"name":"Valentina","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432 \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0435 \"\u0411\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\" \u043d\u0430 4-\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u044f -

It is a very pretty and large community; above all it is very large. There are seven members in the bank and all are women. They themselves chose the name of their group and they say they chose this name because there is a \"pozito\" or small pool near where they meet, which has been there for several years. \r\n\r\nThe members of the bank are all very hardworking and enterprising people with productive businesses. Thus they are requesting a loan from FRAC. They include, for example, Sras.

To date she has successfully had even larger loans.\r\n\r\nShe notes that she is 50 years old and has been married to her second husband, Sr. Remigio, for the past 25 years. They have four children, of whom only one is still dependent on them. Natalia has been selling hotplates and beachwear for 30 years and started the business because she wanted to help her husbands with household expenses. She says: \u201cI enjoy selling very much because formerly I was a street vendor selling both in my own and neighboring communities, etc.  Nowadays, we are selling in the city of Mexico.

The group members are Dona Adelina, Juana, Juliana, Benita and No\u00e9; all of the members are applying for this loan to invest it in buying lambs. The group name was chosen by Lety, who is also part of the group. She says that they decided to use this name because the day that the institution called at the house to invite them to apply for their loan, she was very surprised by it and she thought that this was a good choice for a name. Dona Lety says that she is 38 years old and she has been married to Jose for 19 years. In the family that they have created together they have 4 children who are all currently studying. Lety says that she raises lambs to sell: she buys them when they are young and raises them until they are large, strong and fattened, then she sells them on to people who grill them to sell. Dona Lety says, 'The bigger my lambs get, the more money I will earn although often my greatest difficulties come when the animals get sick and lose a lot of weight, or even when they die and that means I lose my whole investment and earnings. However, thanks to the support provided by the institution, which tell us how to care for our lambs, I have had a lot of help and I have learned things that I never knew before'. This time Dona Lety is applying for this loan to buy grazing lambs and food to nourish them. She tells us that she likes caring for her lambs because her mother taught her how to do it and now she has been able to support her family economically,  which proves that her earnings have helped her a lot. She has used her earnings to improve her house; next she would like to build an entrance hall on to her home. Dona Lety and the rest of the group are very grateful to the institution and to Kiva for the loans that they grant and all the services they provide, such as the training and the discounts which are great, Dona Lety says while smiling, 'To me, the discounts are a great help as with the money that I save, I will be able to be buy her children's graduation dress and an extra little gift.'"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1228748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

The group has 11 members who are very hardworking and responsible and always try to be very punctual on any occasion when the group needs to be addressed for anything.  The group name was chosen because that\u2019s the name of the community they belong to and apparently it\u2019s in the Mazahua tongue.  The group members have requested a new loan to invest in their activities.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bibiana will invest in stuffed toys, Andr\u00e9s in goats for barbeque, In\u00e9s, Rosa and Guadalupe in chickens and turkeys, Irineo and Adelina in their vegetable crops, Martha in her grocery store, Luis in his taxi and Mar\u00eda in her piglets.\r\n\r\nJuana who also forms part of this group relates that she has four children who are still minors; the oldest has just started secondary school.  She\u2019s been married 13 years and she\u2019s 32-years-old.  She lives in a borrowed house and her husband\u2019s employed.  The place they live in is the Las Pe\u00f1as neighborhood that belongs to El Oro, M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nJuana sells plastic containers in all sizes and shapes.  She usually sells to women.  It\u2019s good quality merchandise, not brand-name but durable nonetheless.  For example, she carries sauce containers, lunch boxes, screw containers, drinking glasses and plates, among others.  Juana says that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to sell all her plastic wares because not all housewives venture to buy.  She comments that the situation is very difficult and in order to sell and earn even a little profit she lowers her prices but does not like selling on credit because she runs the risk of some people not paying her.  It\u2019s also been hard to acquire customers because people might buy something from you at the moment and then after a month or two perhaps buy something else and this is why Juana wants to have a good stock of new merchandise on hand for her customers.  There are newer, prettier styles of plastic ware than previous ones and this means that she will be able to sell them all.  It\u2019s advantageous for Juana to invest in packages and she comments that profits are higher that way and better for her because she doesn\u2019t have to go restock so often.  Her husband helps her occasionally to sell more quickly because he\u2019ll sell to his friends at work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":1228785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy plastic ware.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":4850,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irineo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":7875},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":606.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1818.75,"local_amount":23625,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":23670.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120110,"comment":null},{"amount":1212.5,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":15780.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068158,"comment":null},{"amount":1818.75,"local_amount":23625,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":23670.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T23:48:42Z","paid_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492146,"name":"Gs Los Higueros Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carmen de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su conyugue y sus 3 hijos quienes viven en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, ubicada en la comunidad de la Hig\u00fceros, al sur de Honduras, dedic\u00e1ndose a su actividad que es: la venta de rosquillas, Hojaldras, tustacas, quesadillas en la comunidad donde ella vive y alrededores. \nDo\u00f1a Carmen solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos como  le\u00f1a,  ma\u00edz, harinas  y az\u00facar que son los productos que ella necesita para realizar sus productos.\nDo\u00f1a Carmen con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo pretende seguir invirtiendo en su negocio y seguir creciendo al igual que sus dem\u00e1s compa\u00f1eras de grupo quienes se dedican al negocio de pulper\u00eda, y venta de tamales son Do\u00f1a Liliana Y Mar\u00eda ambas residentes en la comunidad delos Hig\u00fceros.\nDo\u00f1a Carmen su sue\u00f1o es poder ir mejorando mas su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - Octubre del 2012\n","en":"Carmen is 40 years old, and she lives with her spouse and their three children in their house, located in the Hig\u00fceros community in southern Honduras.

Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana es una persona mayor de edad conoce muy bien de donde naci\u00f3 el bordado y el tejido de la comunidad, ella tiene 69 a\u00f1os de edad ya es viuda ahora vive sola pero muy cercas de sus hijos y casi pasa todo el d\u00eda con sus nietos. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Juana comenta que antes la lana era natural por lo que ahora ya no solo es sint\u00e9tica, antes ellos mismos elaboraban esta producto, primero lavaban la lana del borrego que sal\u00eda cuando les cortaban la lana, se hacia lino con la lana ya bien lavada y lo obten\u00edan con ayuda de un instrumento de madera, despu\u00e9s tej\u00edan todos estos hilos de lana hasta obtener una tela y finalmente pintaban la tela los colores mas comunes eran el negro, caf\u00e9 y gris. Las cosas han cambiado ahora ya nada de esto se hace porque las telas ya son de muy mala calidad. Ella bordando lleva ya 30 a\u00f1os desde que sus hijos eran peque\u00f1os comenta que esto le ayudo de mucho para darles estudios a sus hijos tambi\u00e9n ayudaba con los gastos del hogar cuando su esposo se quedaba sin empleo, vend\u00eda todos los d\u00edas lunes en Ixtlahuaca sus bordados, Ahora ya solo ofrece con sus conocidos de la comunidad esta sola y muchas veces pues no tiene para cubrir sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas como alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado y vestimenta por eso se dedica a esto, esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar estambres de colores, tela y aujas. Su desaf\u00edo es que muchas veces sus trabajo ya no lo valoran como antes y no le quieren pagar lo que realmente es el precio, comenta que es muy pasado ya que se tardan varios d\u00edas elaborando este trabajo porque todo es echo a mano, ella hace chalecos, morrales, colchas, su\u00e9teres con figuras representativas de la comunidad, como p\u00e1jaros, gretas, estrellas, flores, etc. Una de las metas de do\u00f1a Juana es llegar a vender muchos bordados para poder compra ma\u00edz, porque si no comprar no tendr\u00e1 para hacer sus tortillas durante todo el a\u00f1o ya que es uno de sus alimentos primordiales de todos los d\u00edas. Todas las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy agradecidas por el pr\u00e9stamo ya que podr\u00e1 compra todo el material que les hace falta y podr\u00e1n cumplir con sus pedidos ya atrasados. Angelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Maria, Gregoria, y Mar\u00eda Lucina invertir\u00e1n en los bordados, mientras que Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles y Juana Ir\u00edais invertir\u00e1n en cosm\u00e9ticos. ","en":"The Artesanas del Fresno group is made up of only women who are very hardworking and responsible.  They chose the name because almost all of them make a living in handicrafts (embroidery and textiles), so they're artisans, and \"Fresno\" is because of their community.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana is an older person.  She's very familiar with the origins of embroidery and weaving in the community.  She's 69 years old and a widow.  She lives alone now, but very close to her children, and she spends almost all day with her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Juana says that in the past yarn was natural, but that now it's only synthetic.  They used to make it themselves.  First they washed the wool that came from the sheep when they sheared it.  They made linen with the well-cleaned wool, with the help of a wooden implement.  Then they wove all this wool thread until they had fabric.  Finally they dyed the fabric; the most common colors were black, brown, and grey.\r\n\r\nThings have changed, and now none of this is done because the fabrics are of very poor quality.  She has been embroidering for 30 years, since her children were little.  She says this helped a lot, so she could give her children an education.  It also helped with the household expenses when her husband didn't have a job.  She sold her embroidery in Ixtlahuaca every Monday.  Now she only sells to acquaintances in the community.  She's alone and often doesn't have enough money to cover her basic necessities like food, shoes, and clothing.  This is why she does this.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan to buy colored yarn, fabric, and needles.\r\n\r\nHer challenge is that often her work isn't valued as it was before, and people don't want to pay the true price.  She says it's very old-fashioned; it takes several days to do this kind of work because everything is handmade.  She makes jackets, backpacks, bedspreads, and sweaters with figures that represent the community such as birds, stars, flowers, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of Juana's goals is to sell a lot of embroidery to be able to buy corn.  It's an essential everyday ingredient, and if she doesn't buy it, she won't be able to make her tortillas throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the group are very grateful for the loan because they'll be able to buy all the materials they need and finish the work they're behind on.  Angelina, Leonila, Lucia, Gregoria, Mar\u00eda, and Mar\u00eda Lucina will invest in embroidery, while Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles and Juana Iris will invest in cosmetics.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":1228755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy fabric for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juna Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lucina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.87},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.88},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":815.63,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10615.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120109,"comment":null},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7076.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068157,"comment":null},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7076.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284895,"comment":null},{"amount":271.87,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3538.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199183,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T18:38:09Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492152,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Lucia es una mujer de 60 a\u00f1os de edad ella esta casada y vive en Suchitep\u00e9quez.

child. She has inadequate finances to provide a good educational foundation for her child who is still a teenager.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in 2010, and has managed and successfully repaid her loans. With the new loan she has requested, she will buy hair products, like hair mesh, hair oil, hair treatments and hair caps, buy jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, bangles and watches, buy inner wear and chicks. She holds a strong view on her business succeeding because of longevity in the business and regular customers, and she also has a good site to maintain customers and attract new ones. With this business, the community will maintain beauty at moderate prices, the chick will serve in ceremonial activities and the droppings from the chick will serve as manure for agriculture which will improve yields.\r\n\r\nThe profit from this loan will be used for her child\u2019s education, feeding her family, and also she will reinvest some of the profit back into her business to expand the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1230665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

He has some cattle and one dairy cow that gives about 10-12 liters of milk every day. Akbar's wife sells the milk to their neighbors and gets a small income from this. Akbar has been engaged in this type of activity for more than 10 years. \r\n\r\nThe livestock breeding is their only income and therefore Akbar would like to expand his business. For the loan received, he plans to purchase cattle and increase their number. Akbar thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support.

He's single and lives in the town of Chincha with his parents and siblings. He's a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person with a great deal of drive to overcome. Unfortunately, due to the lack of financial resources and the need to work in order to help his parents pay for their household's expenses, he couldn't study for a professional career in welding. However, he hopes to be able to do that very soon. During his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his friends. Occasionaly, he eats a delicious \"arroz con pur\u00e9\" (rice with mashed potatoes), which is his favorite dish.\r\nWith a lot of hard work and dedication, Jonathan works in the grocery section of one of his town's supermarkets. Everyday he starts working from the early hours of the morning. He may work for about 8 hours, and he believes that he does well because he's very responsible and treats other people in a friendly way.\r\nJonathan is very thankful to Kiva lenders, since thanks to their help he'll be able to do home improvements. He wishes to be able to plaster and paint a large portion of his house and his bedroom, because a short while ago he wanted to help his parents and, thanks to his hard work, they were able to enlarge their house. That way Jonathan hopes to be able to keep on working in order to support his family. He also hopes to achieve his biggest dream of being a good professional and finishing the construction of his house, which will increase his family's safety and well-bring."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1229915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to do improvements in his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-11-07T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-07T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":89.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108.74},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":115.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":117.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":131.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138.28},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":142.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":148.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":153.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":159.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":172.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492545,"name":"Jannet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jannet is 42 years old and lives in Airport.

with his parents and siblings.  He's a very pleasant, hardworking, and enthusiastic person with a great desire for self-improvement.  Unfortunately, because he didn't have the financial resources and had to work from a young age to help his parents, he was unable to undertake professional studies, although he would have enjoyed doing so very much.  In his free time he likes to play soccer, and sometimes he eats a delicious \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" [a Peruvian stew].\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and commitment, Luis works in a construction supply business.  He starts work very early every day and can work approximately 12 hours in shifts.

His location is very good but he needs support to improve his business. That is why he has applied for a youth loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua in order to buy a new espresso machine and an espresso coffee mill.  In addition, he wants to build a tent over his van to make his business easier during the coming winter season.  Most of his customers are passersby and tourists.\r\n\r\nThis is his third cycle with Al Mjamoua and he is a borrower in good standing with a history of repaying his previous loans.  Mohamad hopes to continue expanding his business as much as he can to please his customers and improve his standard of

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source of the income for the family is an agricultural business. Lali has 2 milk cows, whose milk is used to produce cheese products which are sold in their village and nearby villages. Lali also has 5 bee-hives with bee colonies. She harvests the honey and sells it at the local open market. In addition, her mother trades with cereals. Their income is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLali has requested loan from Credo to start up a new family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country-residing rural poor, who do not have access to traditional credit products,--they are typically regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Lali requested credit for the start-up of a grocery store with a sharer. With the requested credit she will purchase grocery products for resale. According to her estimations, her store will work well, as there are no other similar stores. She will attract clients with quality service and a wide assortment of products.\r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1638.39,"image":{"id":1230716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

woman of 48, she has had a grocery store where she sells basic products, located in the house where she lives, for 28 years. In addition to her store, she sells cosmetics and snacks on the weekends in the market in San Raymundo.. She tells us that she is applying for this loan to be able to stock her store by buying grocery products and some Christmas fruits, since the season is coming in which she sells this product year after year, and people already know about it, so she doesn't want this year to be an exception. Now she needs capital to invest. With her work and effort she has been able to raise her daughters, but she has had difficult moments because her husband has been very sick and so hasn't been able to work well, and what he earns at times they can only use for medicine, since he is in treatment for his illness. Now she hopes that FAPE can help her continue striving for her family and especially for her daughters, who are in school and need many things.\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1225647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is a single mother who has four children, and two of her children are in school. In addition, she cares for two other family members (her old parents). \r\n\r\nKasifa sells green bananas at the market on a retail basis. She works for six days a week. It has been ten years since she started this business. She has applied for a loan of 400,000 UGX, to buy more bunches of green bananas for sale. Her business challenges are seasonality and transportation. \r\n\r\nKasifa\u2019s goals and aspirations are to become a wholesaler, to buy a delivery van to make transportation of her fruit easier, and also to buy land and build rental houses. She decided to work with MCDT, because services are simple and therefore easy to access. She rents the house she stays in, and the family has access to electricity but not to piped water. Her greatest monthly expenses are school fees and electricity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1230762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more bunches of bananas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kasifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10.94,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323563292,"comment":null},{"amount":10.94,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323563293,"comment":null},{"amount":10.93,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323563294,"comment":null},{"amount":10.94,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323563295,"comment":null},{"amount":32.81,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84777.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331658795,"comment":null},{"amount":32.82,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84777.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339575343,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":113036.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347119355,"comment":null},{"amount":10.93,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355865088,"comment":null},{"amount":10.94,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":28259.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355865089,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-08T11:20:17Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:14:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492615,"name":"Famata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Famata, 37, is a single parent who lives in West Point with her two children, aged 12 and 16.

She is married and has three small children with whom she gives all her love and all the care they need. They all live together in their own home, and Karen works very hard to improve their quality of life. Karen provides distinct copying services, monographs and didactic drawings. She has a photocopier that she purchased some years ago with the help of her husband and installed it in a space in her home where she tends to customers every day. Luckily, her home is located in front of a kindergarten and near an elementary school, which helps her have permanent customers. She has only been working for two years and it is going very well since her income is stable. What she likes about her job is that she has time to care for her children and do household chores, as well as feeling like she is contributing to children's education by giving them the opportunity to have photocopied texts to help them do their homework. She wants to set up her business with school supplies and increase her profits. This will be her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is grateful to those who have made this possible to help her achieve her objectives. With the loan, she plans to purchase paper, printer ink and some office supplies like pens, pencils and erasers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1230466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase paper, printer ink and some office supplies like pens, pencils and erasers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":127.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":136.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":142.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.65,"local_amount":119.76,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":126.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053820,"comment":null},{"amount":51.79,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":134.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188754,"comment":null},{"amount":51.59,"local_amount":126.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":133.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572656,"comment":null},{"amount":55.64,"local_amount":136.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":144.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122322,"comment":null},{"amount":57.72,"local_amount":142.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":149.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868140,"comment":null},{"amount":59.61,"local_amount":146.73,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576965,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T06:20:16Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492633,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente (pictured from left to right with his daughter, father and wife) and his family are farmers who live in the foothills of the Malinche volcano in the state of Tlaxcala.

She is married and has two children who are grown up and independent. Kelita makes a living primarily in the cultivation of ornamental plants. She has a garden area at her home where she grows a wide variety of plants used for decorations at homes and botanical gardens. She grows roses, daises, gardenias and other flowers, which she sells in small pots when they bloom and reach an adequate vegetation period for the climate. She has had this business for more than five years and enjoys carrying out her work. She also works as a seamstress out of her home, since she has a sewing machine. She also teaches some classes. What she most likes about her work with plants is seeing the variety of flowers in bloom and the bright colors they have. She also enjoys making articles of clothing as a seamstress, but at the moment she can't do that job since her sewing machine doesn't work. She hopes to continue growing her plants, which will be even more vigorous. This will be her eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she has always been a very good member of her community bank, where she is much-loved for being very responsible and supportive. She is grateful to those who have made this loan possible so she can continue growing her business. She is convinced that she will keep being responsible and make her payments on time, as she has done with all her previous loans. With the amount she is requesting, she plans to purchase fertilizers, seeds and plants to expand her garden area, as well as purchase fabric and thread so she can restart her sewing business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1230477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase fertilizers, seeds and plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T04:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T04:30:01Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":523.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":557.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":598.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":621.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":202,"local_amount":523.71,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":524.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053821,"comment":null},{"amount":215.03,"local_amount":557.47,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":557.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188755,"comment":null},{"amount":214.17,"local_amount":555.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":555.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572657,"comment":null},{"amount":231.03,"local_amount":598.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:21Z","rounded_local_amount":599.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122323,"comment":null},{"amount":239.65,"local_amount":621.31,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":621.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868141,"comment":null},{"amount":248.12,"local_amount":643.28,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":643.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-23T15:29:38Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492661,"name":"Boniface","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boniface lives in the Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya.

She is married and has six children, and they all live together in their own home, where she and her husband share the duties of raising their children, for whom they want to give the best. Mar\u00eda makes a living renting a mototaxi. She has one vehicle that she bought six months ago at a discount price because it was used. A driver takes it every day for a set price. In addition to this activity she sells snacks on the city streets or at an area school. She has been doing that job for five years, and she enjoys it because it gives her time to go home and tend to her children. Fortunately now she also has the mototaxi, which will allow her to save more money. She hopes to soon make considerable improvements to her businesses, namely opening a general store where she can offer her snacks as well as groceries of primary need.

Pardaboy, who is experiencing financial difficulties, has learned about the charity of Kiva's lenders, and is now turning to you for help, as if to his close friends.\r\n\r\nPardaboy is a very hard-working person. He is 46 years old, married to a beautiful woman named Niso, and is raising 3 children. His home's climate is very favourable for growing crops and raising livestock. Animal farming constitutes Pardaboy's main business activity and source of income, and he also cultivates potatoes and wheat. He would like to develop his business, but lacks the funds to do so.

She does this in an itinerant manner and by orders from her customers.\r\n\r\nThis loan that she has requested is her third loan, and it is for 7,500 lempiras.  She will use it to buy more clothes, creams, shampoo, lotions, deodorants, and other personal hygiene products in order to increase her inventory and fill the customer orders that are pending.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.She also has a buy and sell business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 60,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnaliza hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business.

She has a son, Sebastian, who is four years old, who has been her motivation in many different areas.  Currently her employment situation allows her to rent a room for herself and her son.  Two years ago, she was working as a teacher, but was not able to continue because she did not have a degree due to financial hardships.  Thanks to the trust of MFP and with accessible loans, she was able to finish and at last work at what has always been her vocation in life.  She considers being a teacher one of the best things it is possible to chose since working with children makes you feel useful in society.   \r\n\r\nHowever many inconveniences she faced, including the lack of organization and solution of the union problems, none were a motivation to dampen her wish to participate in education in her country.

She will be more fluid in her work which will benefit her students.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan.

","en":"\u201cLas Conchitas\u201d (The Little Shells) is a group that consists of 13 individuals, all women, who are from a small community that is located along the highway and near a lake where people fish.  The community is called Concepci\u00f3n Chico, but commonly known as \u201cLa Concha\u201d (The Shell).  This explains why the women of the group called themselves \u201cLas Conchitas\u201d.  \r\n<p>\r\nSeveral of the women will invest their loans in some type of trade:\r\n\u2022\tEleuteria will invest in her grain mill.\r\n\u2022\tDo\u00f1a Modesta, Martha, Maria, Margarita, Birginia, Beatriz, and Maria Guadalupe will invest in their stores.  \r\n\u2022\tLiyezmin will invest in belts.\r\n\u2022\tFelipa will invest in horses for her farm work.  \r\n\u2022\tRosa will invest in her stationery shop.\r\n\u2022\tValentina will invest in feed for her sheep.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group representative is Ana Luisa.  She raises chickens to sell and says the following about her business:  \u201cI devote my time to raising chickens and sometimes turkeys.  Now I want to invest in the purchase of chickens and build a chicken coop where the animals can sleep and protect themselves from the weather.  One problem that I have is that the animals have nowhere to stay, so I have lost a few since they cannot be contained.  I also need to have them vaccinated so that they will not come down with bird flu.  The loan will be a benefit because I have a son who is in elementary school, so I will be able to pay for a few of his school supplies.  My goal is to build a house because my husband and I live at my mother\u2019s house.  I am not married, but we have a common-law relationship.  He works as a bricklayer.  First, I want to save toward the purchase of some land and then acquire a farm afterwards.  It is for this reason that I started my business, so that I could begin earning some money to save toward these goals.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":1228854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and to build a coop.

Together as a couple they have many goals.  They currently live in a wood house that they rent from one of their relatives.  As a woman she leads and administers her home to keep the accounts correctly.  She also works providing services like laundry and house cleaning.  Yuri owns a mototaxi and travels around different streets in their district providing a taxi service.  They have been working together for four years.  Their priority right now is to have their own house, which they consider indespensible in starting to create their household.  One of their hopes is that their children don't have the same necessities that she passed by.  \r\n\r\nThey plan to purchase a plot of land that is being offered.  They consider this a good opportunity since in the future they plan to construct a home so that she can have her own business.  This is her third loan and she promises to make her payments without difficulties.  She thinks that the work within her community bank is a good way to obtain loans since there is information and constant confidence.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 2,500 nuevos soles they plan to purchase their plot of land.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1230849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to make the final payment on a plot of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":277.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":273.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":301.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":311.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":321.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":323.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":342.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":347.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.44},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.73},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.17,"local_amount":277.37,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":280.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053828,"comment":null},{"amount":106.79,"local_amount":273.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":277.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188762,"comment":null},{"amount":117.59,"local_amount":301.49,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":305.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572665,"comment":null},{"amount":121.45,"local_amount":311.41,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":315.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122331,"comment":null},{"amount":125.44,"local_amount":321.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":325.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868149,"comment":null},{"amount":121.22,"local_amount":310.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":314.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576973,"comment":null},{"amount":138.77,"local_amount":355.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":360.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529300,"comment":null},{"amount":135.57,"local_amount":347.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":352.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974430,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T12:39:31Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492835,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Josephine.

Noeline is 22 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. For the past two years, Noeline has been working hard to manage her retail store, which sells posho, sugar, and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Noeline has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to obtain stock for the shop, and will help Noeline to generate greater profits and support the parents. Noeline hopes that in the future she will be able to expand the business. \r\n\r\nNoeline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

She lives with her family group of four adult children, who work with her in her business.  They live in an area with some of the highest social violence in the country. Every day they must cope with it in order not to be pulled in and affected by such a situation.  It is important for her to have a business because it keeps her children occupied, and participating in the economic activity of society and free from the social violence, criminal activities and drugs that nowadays overwhelm the youth.  Her family is the reason why she strives to offer them the best. She has been selling fruits and vegetables for some time. She is well known and she has acquired good customers who seek her out for her good way of serving them and the variety of her merchandise. In addition to this, she has a little cart for selling cakes, which helps her cover the household expenses. Now she wants to improve her workplace, and therefore continue supporting her children so they can have job opportunities in the future like her.  This is why she has come to INTEGRAL to apply for a loan and thus be able to buy tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and bananas, among other items. She is sure that with the help she receives she will be able to offer a better future to her children, and she also has hope in God that she will soon pay off the debt she acquires. She gives thanks in advance for the help that she will receive. She has the satisfaction that she is very capable of doing everything that she proposes.

This work enables her to generate income to support her family economically as she is married and has four children.\r\nWhen she was asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes sharing the training and health information with her friends.\r\nOne of the members, Vicky, is not in the photo due to cultural reasons. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5225,"image":{"id":1230894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-11-08T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-08T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":5225,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicky\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Martha\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36040.61,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2625.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3037.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3036.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":380.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.41},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1261.52,"local_amount":8701.6,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8716.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235622,"comment":null},{"amount":880.82,"local_amount":6075.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6086.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617455,"comment":null},{"amount":880.82,"local_amount":6075.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6086.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172049,"comment":null},{"amount":2201.84,"local_amount":15187.69,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15213.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-07T18:39:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490844,"name":"Santo Domingo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n  Este grupo se llama \"Santo Domingo\" y  se integra de tres se\u00f1oras quien cada una tiene su diferente actividad y vive un pueblo llamado Tecpatan que esta a una hora de Copa\u00ednala.\n\n  La se\u00f1ora Normaida, es quien se  le tomo la entrevista es ama de casa, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Luciano, y con quien procreo cinco hijos, 3 ta estan casadoos y 2 todav\u00eda est\u00e1n a su responsabilidad;

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nPaula operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPaula dreams of having a good life through all her hard work in her business.

A storm and hail damaged his car and he has stopped working. The only source of the income for the family is his wife\u2019s small salary from a kindergarten. It is hardly enough for food for a six-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesiki requested a loan from Credo to re-start the family business (taxi service) that was stopped recently because of a natural calamity (storm damage). His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Besiki will purchase a car. He will be able to continue working as a taxi driver and serve the local people. This business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

\r\n\r\nThis woman has faced so many challenges in life including the death of her sister after lying in the hospital for several months, so that all her money was spent in the hospital.  After her sister's death, she could not provide three square meals to her family.  Thieves also stole her goods in the market,  leaving her with no capital to continue her business. She was sick for several months, and could not pay for her medication due to inadequate finances.\r\n\r\nDorothy Manka'a joined GHAPE in the year 2003, and has taken out and successfully repaid her loans five times. She promises that with the new loan requested, she will buy more food ingredients for her restaurant business like vegetable oil, flour, beans, koki beans, rice, tomatoes, onions and Maggi. She thinks this business will succeed because her business is situated near a school, where students buy from her during breaks.  She sells puff puff, which people buy and eat alongside tea for breakfast.  Her food is in high demand in that locality because of scarcity of restaurants. \r\n\r\nWith this business activity, the community members will not travel long distances in search food.  She also educates the community on how to prepare good food so that they can also engage in the business.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will pay her children's school fees and provide their basic educational needs like text books, pens, pencils and exercise books.  She will also take care of her family's health and plough back into the business.  A GHAPE loan is preferable to her because of low interest rates, convenient repayment intervals and no collateral security before the loans are disbursed.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.91,"image":{"id":1230637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to
