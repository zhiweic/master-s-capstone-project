On his small farm of 16.8 acres he grows corn, beans, cabbage and coffee. Coffee is his main source of income and in the last three seasons he has harvested 150, 300 and 200 quintals of Pergamini coffee from an area of 8.4 acres. The last harvest was smaller due to a blight problem which affected the country's coffee plantations.

She constantly receives orders when there are important ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, funerals, etc.)\r\n\r\nTo make her juice she uses sugar, ginger, tamarind (a highly regarded exotic fruit), envelopes of vanilla sugar and juice powder (banana and orange). All this is  mixed into three liters of water to obtain an excellent flavor. The drink she makes in this way is put  into carefully  washed jerrycans, which are finally put in the refrigerator to cool. \r\n\r\nWishing to grow her stock of ingredients so as to meet the demand of her clientele during this holy season of fasting, she is asking for another loan.

is 37 years old. She lives in Sagarejo District with her husband George and 16-year-old daughter, who goes to school. Manana requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGeorge is an artisan of plastic doors and windows, but nowadays he is unemployed. Unfortunately the family is out of a source of income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Manana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Manana will begin trade with used clothing. She plans to purchase a stock of used clothing at wholesale prices and then resell at higher prices. This will increase the income of the family.

So Nana decided to start up a grocery store to increase the family income but she needs financial support to implement her plan. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nana lacks access to financial institutions to obtain credit to start a business, as they require a stable income and business experience. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so called Start-up Program, that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 1,200 $ Nana will purchase basic groceries to set up a grocery store. She will take care of her clients and treat them in a kind and friendly way. With this assistance, she expects to improve her income and increase the turnover gradually. Nana will work hard to tackle her financial difficulties and make her repayments on time.

She is one of the members of Nongpok Ningthou Group. She is the featured borrower member for the group, and she is pictured with a raised hand. \r\n\r\nThe group comprises seven women members, and all of them are quarry workers. Besides running their businesses to supplement their income, all the group members joined hands for renting the land for a quarry and generating income by sand-sieving. The other group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring, also during the off-season of sand-sieving. Subadani says to earn as a hired quarry worker, the pay is very little. Therefore, the group members contributed equally for the rented plot and manage to earn a better income.\r\n\r\nSubadani runs a shop which is located on the front side of her house plot, which is adjacent to the main lane in the village. She sells betel nuts, betel leaves, potatoes, various cereals, sugar, tea leaves, edible oils, ginger, onions and all essential daily items. With the meager income, she also shares the family expenses with her husband, who is a driver by profession. \r\n\r\nShe usually gets the supplies from the main market and sells them in the village with a little profit. She says that during farming season, sales go down because most of her customers are farmers or daily wage-earners. Therefore, she also closes her shop for a time and engages herself along with the other group members and starts quarry work. With the income from both the shop and the quarry, she opened a bank account and started saving. She also joined a savings group along with the other group members.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase coated jewelry and summer garments. She will sell them in the shop and also take them door to door. She says the place where she lives is mostly inhabited by Meetei people, and these people use jewelry for many occasions and rituals. She wanted to sell them before the festive season starts. In both ways, jewelry and garments can be sold with the same purpose. \r\n\r\nSubadani thanked Kiva and WSDS. She says, \u201cGod helps those who helps themselves, and our group is a very hardworking group. Kiva and WSDS are a blessing in disguise.

She has many customers who prefer her business because the products are fresh, well-priced, high quality, and her service is excellent.\r\n\r\nMaria is an entrepreneurial woman, dedicated to her work, and wants to move forward. She is always looking for ways that will allow her to achieve success. \r\n\r\nIn the last few week, demand has risen and she wants to take advantage of this by making a new investment, but she does not have enough capital. For this reason, she requests a loan from INTEGRAL that will permit her to buy fruits and vegetables in bulk.

She started earning more with the surplus income after selling the sand, pebbles, soil and stones from the rented land. She purchased school uniforms, and gave admission fees and school fees, and also manages the family expenses. \r\n\r\nDuring the rainy season, she weaves all types of traditional attire for both men and women, and sells the finished products for profit to the women vendors in the city market. With the small profit, she could do some savings and also managed to join a savings group. Her one wish was fulfilled after the inception of the group\u2019s formation, and she could have a share in the group savings. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Ibemcha is planning to contribute a share to rent a bigger plot of land for quarry purposes. She and her group decided to use the loan and their savings to rent a bigger plot of land for the said purpose. She said that just the loan is not sufficient because they require small and large cranes to excavate the land for sieving purposes. Therefore, they will utilize the group savings for a better outcome.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to let all her three children complete their education and get a job on their own.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also quarry labourers and engage themselves in weaving and tailoring when they don\u2019t work at the quarry sites.\r\n\r\nIbemcha thanked Kiva and WSDS for the help, and wishes them good luck, happiness and prosperity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1382557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","use":"to rent a larger plot of land for sand-sieving purposes for a bigger income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tilo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hemapati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Piyo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manglembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngangbiton","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoinu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanatombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":125000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T05:53:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585350,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":139.14,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothing and shoes to sell to customers.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-07-20T22:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-19T22:50:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":126.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":137.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":143.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":147.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.01,"local_amount":117.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":121.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864978,"comment":null},{"amount":47.68,"local_amount":127.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353344,"comment":null},{"amount":47.45,"local_amount":126.54,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":130.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905111,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T14:39:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585295,"name":"Maria Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer emprendedora de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, casada con dos hijos de 14 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad.

is 29 years old. He lives in the Rustavi District with his parents and his 22-year-old brother. Tengiz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTengiz works as a baker at a local bakery and gets a small income of 400 GEL in a month. This is the only source of income for their family, as other family members are unemployed. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTengiz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Tengiz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

She could sell her work in the village or to the businesswomen who deal with woven products and sell them in the marketplace in the main market. She also gets the threads and yarns from shop owners on credit, and gives them back once she sells the woven products in the market. A small portion of the amount is left for Lata at the end of the whole process. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase yarn and threads for weaving. She will weave them and sell the woven products to the women vendors who sell woven garments in the main market. Through this activity, she could manage a monthly savings, and tension will be lifted for purchasing yarn and threads. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the financial help, and says she will always remain thankful. God bless Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1385238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase yarn and threads to weave, and then sell the woven products to the women vendors in the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bimola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibechoubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thoibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T06:00:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584567,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is a married man with two children.

The village is about 40 kms from the main city of Manipur, which is one of the Northeastern States of India. The literal meaning of \u201cChaokhat\u201d is \u201cprosperity\u201d. The group members join hands to prosper and encourage one another. \r\n\r\nRanjana is the featured borrower, and she is pictured with her hand raised.  Ranjana\u2019s husband is a paid driver. He is presently working as a paid driver for the district legislature. Managing the household expenses is difficult for Ranjana because she had two kids who study in private schools. The administration in the government schools in town is in fallout, and school kids are given less importance. Ranjana uses all means to supplement the family income. She weaves, quarries, and also runs a tea stall. \r\n\r\nRanjana\u2019s tea stall is located near the roadside of the village where they live. She wanted to run the tea stall at the main town market, but that is not possible at the moment. She needs a license from the town municipality department for registration. The tea stall is open at dawn for school-going kids, and she prepares toast, puris and fried potatoes, and serves the customers the morning breakfast. During the daytime, she prepares lemon tea, sugar-free tea, and milked tea for village elders. She usually closes the tea stall by 4:00 pm every day and does not run business on Sundays. \r\n\r\nDuring the farming and harvesting seasons, most of the villagers are in the field, and very few customers are left. Therefore, she and the rest of the group members engage themselves in quarrying. She sieves sand, pebbles and soil, and earns a wage. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase stocks of wheat, bags of flour, and edible oils for her tea shop. The small earnings are usually spent on the children\u2019s education, such as fees, uniforms and textbooks. Ranjana is typically left with no capital to run the tea stall with abundant supplies, due to a small income and everyday household expenses. She is planning to make more income by selling more local delicacies when she purchases the stocks. \r\n\r\nRanjana is planning to have her own vendor seat at the town market shed with a proper license in the future. She will save money as hard as she can, and will also pay back the loan regularly.

The Kiva loan will be a great support for Eka to increase the turnover gradually and generate income. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":716.09,"image":{"id":1390831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to start up a grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kutaisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T02:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T02:20:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":143.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":149.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":151.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":178.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":182.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":191.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":196.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":141.25,"local_amount":141.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":141.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857590,"comment":null},{"amount":137.71,"local_amount":137.71,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134239,"comment":null},{"amount":143.07,"local_amount":143.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:10Z","rounded_local_amount":143.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107822,"comment":null},{"amount":144.38,"local_amount":144.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":144.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255356,"comment":null},{"amount":149.68,"local_amount":149.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-19T11:22:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584600,"name":"Saffie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 27-year-old Saffie from Waterloo Western rural area in Freetown.

She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nAda has requested a loan in order to purchase items such as drinks, cigarettes, biscuits and soap.

She became involved with income-generating activities alongside her mother who sold condiments. After several years of learning from her, she evolved on her own, ultimately to become a retail clothing merchant.\r\n\r\nShe has been in business for 15 years. Her selling strengths are the affordability of her products, her business acumen and especially the quality of her clothes.\r\n\r\nTo meet her customers' demand, especially for the coming holidays - namely Ramadan, the Tabaski (important Muslim festival also known as A\u00efd El Kabir), Christmas and December 31 -  she is requesting a new loan from Soro Yiriwaso with whom she has been cooperating for the past 36 months. \r\n\r\nAll  three individual loans have been repaid in full. This will be the fourth loan she will use to buy 50 lengths of wax cloth (colorful West-African fabric). She resupplies in Bamako. Mrs. Fatoumata sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed mainly of women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to make monthly profits of 50,000 FCFA, she will use to deal with family expenses and pay her tontines (participation in group savings)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":290.91,"image":{"id":1392588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T05:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T05:50:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":36392.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207564,"comment":null},{"amount":72.72,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":36392.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972242,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36392.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624816,"comment":null},{"amount":72.73,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":36392.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T05:48:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584619,"name":"Norah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norah lives in Uganda Kampala, is married with four children, and two of her children go to school.

43-year-old Jenneh from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown.

In 2009, Jenneh established her general stock business.  She works at the business from 8:00 am until 9:00 pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nJenneh requires a loan in order to purchase gallons of palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. In the future, Tenneh plans to own the biggest local food store in the community.

is 42 years old. She is married and has two children aged 23 and 19.  In 2005, she established her grocery store business.  Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and she used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, Radha plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support. In the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.

He lives in Ifola with his children and wives in a traditional family. He has been buying and selling cereals and food products for the past seven years and his experience in this field has earned him a good reputation; he receives orders from a variety of customers.

When she moved to the United States four years ago, she wanted to create employment opportunities for herself and other immigrants and to provide high-quality African food. \r\n\r\nShe began her business with a $50 investment and started making kenkey (a fermented cornmeal dumpling-type dish that is a staple in parts of West Africa) from her own kitchen. She had her church community, friends and family test out the flavor. \r\n\r\nIn hope of expanding her business, she began working out of a commercially licensed kitchen in June 2011. Her business, Kadosh Foods Enterprise, does food processing, cooking, marketing, and distribution of Kenkey, Shito (a hot black pepper sauce ubiquitous in Ghana), friend fish, and shrimp. The next year, she moved into her own space, allowing her to produce and ship\/cater her food to other restaurants, markets, or events. \r\n\r\nThe largest challenge for her business at the moment is that her clientele is growing quickly and demand is high, but she does not have the machinery to produce as quickly as she needs to. It takes approximately seven hours to cook and prepare a batch of Kenke. One of the steps in the process that could decrease time is the vacuum sealing step to prepare the packages for shipment. She feels that if she cannot produce the amount her clients are demanding, they may turn to other suppliers. \r\n\r\nThis $3,000 Accion loan will help her to purchase the vacuum seal machine while simultaneously building a credit history.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1263.02,"image":{"id":1390954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a vacuum seal machine while simultaneously building a credit history.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New York, New York","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuuruyatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2994.95,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":155.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":156.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":159.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":160.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":162.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":167.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":170.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172.07},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":174.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":176.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":184.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":187.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.18},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.48},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":286.1,"local_amount":285.62,"processed_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":286.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399723024,"comment":null},{"amount":152.6,"local_amount":152.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409992053,"comment":null},{"amount":342.78,"local_amount":342.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-28T09:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":342.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419756778,"comment":null},{"amount":164.18,"local_amount":163.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T09:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":164.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429406882,"comment":null},{"amount":317.36,"local_amount":316.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":317.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-13T23:04:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584812,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aida is an entrepreneur who lives in Ozamiz City with her family.

People from all corners of the districts throng in to purchase. After her vegetable selling business started, she joined the group savings plan and also manages daily savings against the local investment agency.

up, Donnyette was always the one her friends went to for advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been that person who thought I knew everything,\u201d Donnyette says with a smile. \u201cPeople would come to me, lean on me for advice and I\u2019d tell them what I thought. I always thought I\u2019d be the next Dear Abby or Ann Landers, actually!\u201d\r\n\r\nAs a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in her hometown of New Orleans for 18 years, Donnyette has certainly helped many people, particularly children, through her work, even if she hasn\u2019t landed a syndicated newspaper column just yet. \r\n\r\nDonnyette\u2019s next challenge is taking her work to the next level by starting a behavioral health agency, strategically named Positive Direction Support Services, LLC. \r\n\r\nThroughout her career, Donnyette has worked with people of all ages, but her passion is working with children. Most recently, she has served as a school social worker in the Orleans Parish School District. \r\n\r\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, she launched a program at her church called Sister to Sister Devotion, which aimed to build self-esteem and peer support among teenage girls. This was Donnyette\u2019s passion for eight years until Hurricane Katrina displaced the group\u2019s membership. The now adult members of the group are still in touch with Donnyette and want to organize a reunion, to re-connect with what they call their \u201cfoundation.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the experience from that first entrepreneurial \u2013 albeit volunteer \u2013 venture that inspired Donnyette to launch her own practice. Positive Direction is engaged in a partnership with the Louisiana Office of Behavioral Health to provide counseling and teaching services, clinical assessments and psychiatric evaluations for children in the New Orleans metropolitan area. \u201cI\u2019m responding to a significant need in New Orleans for quality social work services that are offered directly in the community\" (in clients\u2019 homes, in schools and other settings such as churches), she says. \r\n\r\nWhile Donnyette\u2019s experience speaks for itself, finding funding for the relatively small amount needed to open her practice was a challenge and she is grateful for the opportunity to receive a loan. \r\n\r\nDonnyette plans to hire more social workers as she grows her practice and aims to build the kind of team spirit and commitment that she experienced at some of her past workplaces. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe kids deserve it; they didn\u2019t ask to have the issues that they have,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to promote hope, healing and wholeness to all the children and their families in [the hope] that it will become infectious throughout our ailing community.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo while Donnyette is taking on a new business venture and now must focus on the details of the business side as much as directly counseling clients, she maintains the same dedication to helping people that she had as a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cI still have that save the world mentality,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little different now.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1142.3,"image":{"id":1391009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To

But, by the grace of God, they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nJeralyn owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the stores are connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, 5 PHP of cooking oil, an egg, or other products. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price. Then she will sell them per piece, for a higher price, to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passerby, and the people in the community. She earns 300 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting 17,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help to her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nJeralyn hopes that her business will grow and expand. She dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her life and business every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n

hard-working 30-year-old man.  He is married with three excellent children and they all live in a small village.  It is very hard to find a well-paying job in the village, and this is why Zafar has his own business which brings him a good stable income.  He raises and slaughters cows and calves.  Zafar buys calves for a low price at the market, then he fattens them and sells their meat.  His wife helps him in this business.  To sell their meat, they have their own butcher's stall at the local market.  Zafar already has a regular clientele who trust him and the quality of his meat.  He uses the income he receives to feed his family, but his children are growing and their needs are increasing.  For this reason, Zafar wants to expand his business so he can increase his income and fully satisfy his family's needs.  Zafar has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy three calves to raise and sell.  He is expecting a positive result and he thanks Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1389932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-21T16:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-20T16:20:08Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zafar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":256.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":262.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":276.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":285.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.32},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250.16,"local_amount":250.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860033,"comment":null},{"amount":256.39,"local_amount":256.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":256.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136780,"comment":null},{"amount":262.77,"local_amount":262.77,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":262.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900977,"comment":null},{"amount":830.68,"local_amount":830.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":830.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550160,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T14:49:39Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584845,"name":"Guilhermina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Guilhermina is taking a loan of $1,500 from TRM (Tuba Rai Metin).

He is the father of 2 children.  He has lived in the countryside all of his life, and this is where he learned to do agricultural work 20 years ago.  He now works on farms as a supervisor who is in charge of raising and fattening pigs.  This is how he has obtained the income to support his family over all of these years.\r\n\r\nThis borrower is a tenacious man who is dedicated to his family and his work.

She has an adolescent daughter who is 15 years old.  After her husband left, she has had a traumatic and very difficult situation. At the time, she was without a job and her economic situation was not good.  In spite of all the difficulties and obstacles she faced, she didn't lose heart, because she had something to fight for -- her daughter.\r\n\r\nWith vision, determination and a desire to get ahead, she started her own business seven years ago -- a store for clothing and general merchandise, a business that she complements with painting ceramic figurines.  With this, she has been able to obtain resources for maintaining household necessities and for educating her daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her second loan, to invest it in the purchase of more merchandise (blouses, jeans, accessories, watches), with the goal of offering greater variety to her customers, to satisfy their needs and thus increase her sales.

is a 30-year-old married woman.

This is the only source of income for their family, which is not enough to make ends meet for a family of four. In the region there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living. \r\n\r\nSo, Tea decided to start a farming business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Tea\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative, the Kiva and Credo Start-up Program, which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan of 4,000 GEL, she will purchase three milking cows and feed for them. After buying milking cows, Tea will milk them and start producing dairy products for selling. \r\n\r\nThe start-up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva

from Sierra Leone!  This is 33-year-old Fatmata from Waterloo, which is in the Eastern area in Freetown.  She is married with 3 children between the ages of 1 and 19 years old.  Two of her children attend school.  She started a business to earn a daily survival income for her family. \r\n\r\nFatmata has been running a groundnuts business since 2005, selling groundnuts within her community.  She works at the business from 4:30 and will not rest until the food is finished.  Fatmata says that the main challenge to her business is price control in the market.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities, such as cooking seasoning, oil, and rice.  The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business.  In the future, she plans to have a permanent business residence.  She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":62.46,"image":{"id":1391484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is a resident of Caloocan, Pasay, Philippines.  She is a 58-year-old widow with three children, all of whom are working.  Life, indeed, is hard.  But, by the grace of God, she was able to raise her children well and to continue working to cover her everyday needs.\r\n\r\nSalvacion owns a variety store.  This is a small store, just connected to or just inside the house, which can be owned by anyone in the community.  This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo, conditioner, a bar of soap, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg, for example.  Salvacion obtains her products from a wholesaler at a lower price then sells it at a higher price for profit.  She also sells charcoal and rice.  Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community.  She earns 700 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan in order to expand her inventory (groceries, toiletries, beverage, etc.).  This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.  Salvacion hopes that her business will grow and expand.
