Her business, launched 17 years ago with a starting sum of 3,000 som (KGS), currently earns around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products. Her business profits have allowed Gulnara to expand the range of her activities and to start planting potatoes and wheat. In order to continue developing her business, Gulnara has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and subsequent resale. She plans to invest her profits into further expansion of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1720,"image":{"id":1079909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Svetlaya Polyana village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-26T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-26T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":645,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T09:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":30240.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938562,"comment":null},{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20160.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012276,"comment":null},{"amount":645,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":30240.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426613,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T06:35:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":418000,"name":"Valeria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valeria is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

de 45 a\u00f1os es un hombre casado, que tiene dos hijos en las edades de 18 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en Puerto Colombia, un municipio ubicado  a la orilla del mar caribe, con un potencial tur\u00edstico importante, en tanto muchas de las familias de Barranquilla y otras ciudades cercanas se trasladan all\u00ed, para disfrutar de su paisaje de playa brisa y mar y de las deliciosas comidas a base de pescado de mar, que se venden alrededor de la playa. \u00c1ngel desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, se dedica a  la venta de pescado, actividad que se ide\u00f3, despu\u00e9s de haber experimentado vendiendo mercanc\u00eda variada a cr\u00e9dito. Los proveedores principales de \u00c1ngel,  son los pescadores  del balneario de Puerto Velero, hermoso y  tur\u00edstico lugar, donde este traslada  en una moto de su propiedad  y trasporta el pescado en cavas de pl\u00e1stico e icopor; cuando la pesca es abundante \u00c1ngel contrata  un carro para traer a Puerto Colombia su producto estrella. Los espec\u00edmenes que mas comercializa son Sable, corvina, caritos, cojin\u00faa, sierra, robalo, pargo, chivo, y langostino. Cuando hay subienda de pescado, \u00c1ngel distribuye entre varios vendedores para que ellos tambi\u00e9n comercialicen en su pueblo. La jornada laboral de \u00c1ngel inicia desde las 5:00 A.M. con un viaje a Puerto Velero y regresa a las 7:30 A.M. Luego hace los repartos y se desocupa a las 12:00 M. Los principales clientes son vecinos del sector, que se encuentran pensionados a quienes les otorga cr\u00e9dito,  para que al final del mes cuando reciban su dinero le paguen. Gran parte del cr\u00e9dito que solicita, lo destinar\u00e1 a financiar las ventas a cr\u00e9dito, pues ante la calidad de sus frescos productos su clientela se incrementa y requiere tener capital de trabajo para aprovechar oportunidades.  En la actualidad \u00c1ngel est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el que comprar\u00e1 pescado en mayor volumen que el acostumbrado y aumentar el volumen de ventas y con ello sus ingresos, importantes para fortalecer el bienestar de su familia.    ","en":"\u00c1ngel, 45, is married and has two children, aged 18 and 20.  He lives in Puerto Colombia, a town located on the coast of the Caribbean, with great tourist potential; such that many families from Barranquilla and other nearby cities relocate there to enjoy its beach and sea breeze and the delicious fish dishes offered along the beach.\r\n\r\nFor four years \u00c1ngel has been selling fish, which was an idea he came up with after selling different merchandise on credit.  His main suppliers are fishermen in Puerto Velero, which is a beautiful tourist location.  He drives his motorcycle there and collects the fish in plastic and styrofoam containers.  When fish is abundant, \u00c1ngel rents a car to bring his star product to Puerto Colombia.  The species he sells are saberfish, sea bass, perch, red jack, saw fish, white snook, dog snapper, chivo and shrimp.  When there is abundant fish, \u00c1ngel distributes it among several sales people who sell in their villages.  \u00c1ngel's work day begins at 5:00 a.m. when he travels to Puerto Velero, returning at 7:30 a.m.  He then makes deliveries until 12:00 noon.\r\n\r\nHis main customers are retired neighbors to whom he extends credit and then collects from at the end of the month.  Most of the loan he is requesting will be used to finance his credit sales, since he requires working capital to take advantage of the quality fresh products to increase clientele.  Currently, \u00c1ngel is applying for his first CrediKiva loan through the Mario Santo Foundation, which he intends to use to buy more fish than he usually does so he can increase sales and income to strengthen his family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1074335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To buy greater volumes of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-26T09:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-26T09:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283141235,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101116,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338729,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395291,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775095,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387081,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":525000,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":529500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993937,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T20:17:11Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":416752,"name":"Santa Rosa De Yanacoto Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca es socio de la Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cSanta Rosa De Yanacoto\u201d la cual est\u00e1 integrado por 12 socios unidos, siendo la gran mayor\u00eda vecinos de la zona.

is a 36-year-old farmer from the Khoni district. She is married and lives with her family - her husband Vazha and her 14-year-old daughter, who goes to school. Tea\u2019s daughter has health problems and receives a pension from the government. Vazha serves in the army of the country. Tea is leading the family agricultural business. She has two milk cows and a calf. Tea produces cheese and sells it on the local open market. She also has a greenhouse, where she grows greens and tomatoes. Harvested products are also sold on the local open market. The total average monthly income of the family is 750 laris.\r\n\r\nTea requested credit for purchasing a polyethylene cover for the greenhouse.

His monthly income is 250 AZN, which is not enough to cover the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nTo improve his business Nijat is requesting a loan for 1,000 AZN, which he will use to buy garden tools, fertilizers, and seeds. Fresh fruits and vegetables are very popular and in high demand because people prefer to eat them every day and consider them very healthy. Also one of the favorite national dishes, Dolma, is made of fresh eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1077658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

She makes and sells delicious pupusas in a variety of flavors and has been doing this for many years.  She has much experience and many steady customers who prefer to buy from her more each day.

He makes a living farming basic grains and yucca. He has been working as a farmer for many years; it is what allows him to put bread on the table. He is a very hard worker, whom many people think highly of. By cultivating these products he is able to sustain himself and his family. Every year during harvest time he sells a part of the harvest to be able to have funds to cover the necessities of his home.

is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kireka in the Kampala south region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children with one of them currently in school. For the past 2 years, Halimah has been working hard to manage her small business which sells charcoal. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Halimah has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal for resale and will help Halimah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her kid. Halimah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \r\n\r\nHalimah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Her profits go toward savings, food, and her children's schooling.  She just took out her 16th loan and has seen her sales increase, so she decided to increase her loan amount for this new cycle.  This new loan will allow her to buy five dozen pieces of clothing and 20 pairs of shoes.  Her difficulties in business are often state taxes.

The capital from the new loan cycle will be used by the Trust Bank members to boost the productivity of their businesses \u2013 benefiting not only them but also their families. Having named their group \"Shalom\" (Peace) for a reason, the members hope every loan cycle brings their families closer to contentment. \r\n\r\nMost group members are from the municipality of Olintepeque in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Olintepeque has paved roads that connect its villages, with farms scattered among the villages. Residents of the area are primarily engaged in growing corn, wheat, beans, green beans, peas, oats, potatoes, and fruits. Some residents make crafts, including jewelry, leather, wax and wood. The languages spoken in Olintepeque are Spanish and K'iche.\r\n\r\nOlivia, who is one of the youngest members of the Shalom Trust Bank, is 24 years old and is a single mother of two boys (an eight-year-old who is already in school and a two-year-old). Olivia is a street vendor who sells fruits and <i>pupusas<\/i> (a type of traditional food), which she has been doing for about eight years. She sells in eight different villages and works six days a week. Some days, Olivia leaves home at 6:30 a.m. and does not return until 8 p.m. \r\n\r\nHaving never completed her education, Olivia decided to go back to school and is now in the fifth grade. She hopes to continue learning and, one day, become a teacher. For Olivia, being part of Friendship Bridge and having access to small loans is really helpful because she can now earn an income to support herself and her two children, give her children an education and continue her own education. \r\n\r\nWith a new loan through Kiva lenders, Olivia will buy a variety of fruits so that she can continue to expand her business\u2014her clientele is growing and she needs to keep up! Besides completing her education, Olivia dreams of one day owning a proper storefront to sell her fruit. She struggles with her business during the rainy season because it is difficult to travel. With a storefront, her clients would know where she is at all times and be able to come to her. \r\n\r\nOlivia and her fellow Shalom Trust Bank members are thrilled that people from other countries want to help them. They are grateful for the support of Kiva lenders because they are not only gaining financial assistance but also they are building success. The Shalom Trust Bank sends their blessings. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1078246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a variety of fruits and chickens.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Arcoiris Trust Bank was formed by 14 enthusiastic and hard-working women. The group named their trust bank Arcoiris (rainbow) because the rainbow resembles the spectrum of colors used in their traditional clothing. \r\n\r\nThis group is located in the village of Juchanep, which is a rural community about 30 minutes away from downtown Totonicap\u00e1n in southwestern Guatemala. The languages spoken in Juchanep are Spanish and K'iche.\r\n\r\nThe Arcoiris Trust Bank will be starting their sixth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. The women are anxiously waiting for their new loans, which will help fund their various businesses and enable them to prepare for the village fair, which is set for June 2012. The fair is one of their biggest selling events of the year. Nine of the Trust Bank members are weavers and the others are involved in commerce activities of some sort.\r\n \r\nPaulina is one of the founders of the Trust Bank. Named after her grandmother, she only has a second-grade education but is a very proactive and dynamic woman. Paulina is 36 years old, has four children and is currently the president of the Arcoiris Trust Bank. \r\n\r\nPaulina has worked in the textiles industry for 15 years. Her business has grown considerably over the years, and she currently has two full-time employees. Paulina and her employees are able to make nine cortes (typical skirts) a week, but in high demand seasons, they work longer hours and can produce enough cortes to keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her textile business, Paulina recently started raising chickens. With this new loan from Kiva, Paulina plans to buy a variety of threads to make several cortes that clients have ordered, and she plans to buy more chickens to raise. Paulina's dreams are to employ at least two more people and to continue to support her children's education.\r\n\r\nThe Arcoiris Trust Bank members appreciate the support Kiva lenders provide and the trust Kiva lenders put in their businesses, which helps the Trust Bank members' families and improves their lives.

is Florife, age 52, a resident of Dasmarinas in Cavite Province in the Philippines. Her husband, Melchor, is also her business partner. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nFlorife operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the unit. Her store is located adjacent to her house. She also does direct selling for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 32,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFlorife hopes that her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1078470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy
