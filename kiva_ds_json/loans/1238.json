After I knew that history subject is one of the major subjects in this field, I entered an Olympiad studies in my lyceum. In 2002 Oblast History Competition I won fourth place. My teacher gave me a mass of information about this type of profession and gave an idea to study in AUCA, department of ICP, because she herself pursued her Masters\u2019 Degree at this university. Many educated people I know are devoting themselves to society\u2019s life and have education in this field. \r\n\r\n\"The most I like in this profession is that it has many directions. A person who knows politics can manage the whole society. Politics is one of the most important parts of society\u2019s life. So it is mostly about power. A politician is a person who knows  how the mechanisms of power look like and work. A politician can feel and use his or her power in the whole society\u2019s life as well as in his little district. Politician\u2019s work seems to me both important for society and for a person himself. To become a high qualified specialist in this field I chose to study at AUCA. \r\n\r\n\"Another thing that attracts my attention in this field is that politicians bring together their work, journalists\u2019, economists\u2019 work. AUCA also gives a unique opportunity for students who need financial aid, which is Kiva loan. I am applying for Kiva loan, which will cover part of my tuition fees.\u201d

She has a partner and he works in agriculture growing basic grains. Their children still live with them and are studying; the oldest daughter is in the first year of college, the second daughter is in 7th grade and their son is in third grade.\r\n\r\nOtilia earns a living making and selling crafts such as hemp bags, handbags, purses, bracelets and earrings. She has now been doing this for 3 years. She learnt how to do this because she attended a workshop where all of these craft techniques were being taught. This project was promoted by Fomilenio. She started by making a few products which sold out quickly with the arrival of tourists in the area where she lives and so she was encouraged to increase her business. She makes the products at home and then takes them to the business which is situated in the centre of the community, 300 metres from her house. She sells from 8am to 5pm, 3 days a week. Before selling crafts she used to sell products from catalogues and this is how she made a living.\r\n\r\nThe loan Otilia is asking for is to buy hemp fabric for bags and purses, wax, and hemp fibre for decorating hairbands. The loan will help her because she will be able to buy all of her materials in one go. When she has to buy items separately it makes it more difficult as it works out more expensive and this stops her from buying other items for the home.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business. As far as the family goes, she hopes her children will be able to study in higher education and become professionals so they won't have any worries in life and will have everything a family needs.\r\n\r\nShe will do all of this with the profits she gets from her business. She will increase the business by building her own premises, since the place where she sells currently is shared with other women."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.52,"image":{"id":1452127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy hemp fabric for bags and purses, wax, and hemp fibre for decorating hairbands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T16:20:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Otilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":29.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":29.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505278,"comment":null},{"amount":22.94,"local_amount":22.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":22.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716359,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T03:21:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620515,"name":"Rosa Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es una mujer que est\u00e1 felizmente casada con Jos\u00e9 Arias y juntos han procreado 5 hijos los mismos que ya han realizado sus vidas cada uno de forma independiente.

With the support of her parents, she was able to finish secondary school but, after that, she needed to work to support her family due to a lack of economic resources.\r\n\r\nTheir home is located in a rural sector of the province of Cotopaxi called San Jos\u00e9 de Yanayacu, which is primarily a farming community. Their home is very humble due to the great needs that they have experienced. Their family is very united.\r\n\r\nRosa takes care of her disabled daughter and receives vouchers from the national government that help pay for her medications. Her small business has continued to grow. Even though she has a job that demands a lot of time and effort, she completes all of the household tasks, cares for her husband, and also manages her household's finances.\r\n\r\nHer business is agriculture and raises small animals. She has a plot of land where she grows green onions, potatoes, and everything else that the land provides to her. She works from 11 to 12 hours per day.\r\n \r\nSince the area is a farming and ranching area, the people support themselves day to day with these activities. Even though it is far from the city, there are families that work in many different areas to support themselves and their community.\r\n\r\nRosa requests this loan to purchase seeds and tools to perform her job better.

is Anita, 62, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Norberto, a farmer, and is the mother of two children who are already working and have their own families. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the farm. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAnita operates a dalandan (Philippine orange) farm. She grows the fruit on their farm located in Cavite. She sells her product to markets and fruit stores that she regularly supplies and to the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 9000 in sales each month. \r\n\r\nCuriously, dalandan has been called \"sweet orange\" or \"sour orange\" in English. In the Philippines, the flesh is orange while the skin is green and thin enough to be easily peeled off with the fingers. The fruit is peeled and eaten by Filipinos, usually with a bit of rock salt if it is sour, and dalandan juice is popular drink in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nTo help Anita continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizer and farm inputs for her business. Part of the loan will go for the maintenance of her farm. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnita dreams to expand her business and help her children through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":420,"image":{"id":1448228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for fertilizer and farm inputs for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1266.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":7600.02,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7765.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824946,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5066.98,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478768,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5066.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701170,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-16T18:22:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617938,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Lolita works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store business in the Philippines and also earns income from pig fattening.

She\u2019s married and her husband works in agriculture and as a day laborer.  They have two children living at home.  One of them is 20-years-old and he\u2019s disabled so neither attends school nor works.  Their daughter attends first year of high-school at the Instituto Nacional.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has worked in agriculture since she was little; her parents taught her how to work the land and grow corn and beans.  Since her family was of scarce economic resources they only worked the land and did no other activity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to working the land, Mar\u00eda also bakes bread to sell in her community.  To reach her fields that are a kilometer away to do her agricultural chores she must take a 20-minute walk.  Her husband helps her do the agricultural work and her daughter helps out too.

It is really important to make the right choice what profession one wants to gain. Therefore, I have enrolled in the American University of Central Asia, Department of International and Comparative Politics. \r\n\r\n\"I am impressed by AUCA\u2019s rich history and its current efforts connected to inclusiveness and equality. The collaboration between the faculty and undergraduate students, the sense of community, and flexible interdisciplinary nature of the curriculum is all important to me. \r\n\r\n\"I have been interested in studying international relations or international politics for many years. My interest in pursuing this field stems from several factors which have affected me. The first factor is my studies in the US. I had a great chance to represent my country. That year gave me a lot of experience, feelings, and thoughts. \r\n\r\n\"Second, I am fascinated by history, economics, and diplomacy. I believe, through the study of international politics, I can effectively satisfy my curiosity in these fields. \r\n\r\n\"And the third factor that had affected my interest in international politics is that I would like to become a person to represent our country abroad. The last thing I can tell about my choice is that I believe that, after graduation of AUCA, I will become professional in the political field. \r\n\r\n\"Participating in my high-school\u2019s debate program has been my most meaningful activity in the US. This experience has changed me. I have learned how to speak in front of a huge number of students, without getting nervous and how to argue the merits of any side. \r\n\r\n\"Taking part in the debates also gave me an opportunity to be aware of current topics of global importance, such as the debate problems of the homeless, healthcare, etc. I think participation in debates will help me in my future career. It is something that I feel enthusiastic about.\r\n\r\n\"The other point worth mentioning about AUCA is that it gives the students a very unique opportunity which is a loan for students to be able to cover their tuition fees. I will take an opportunity to apply for it also, which will give me a good opportunity to be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d

She feels really excited to expand her business by selling mobile phone airtime credits and servicing bill payments. For the last month, she has around $10 - 12 per day in sales on average (just mobile phone airtime credit sales). Recently, she took a loan from KIVA to buy a printer to support her business in selling mobile phone airtime credits and servicing household electricity bill payments."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20.83,"image":{"id":1448276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family', Gladys replied 'My livelihood shall improve'.\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Gladys owns the following: cow, poultry but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

His parents didn't send him to school when he was little.\r\n\r\nMarto's married.  His wife doesn't work; she only takes care of the household chores.  They have two older children who live in their house.  Both children attend school and work in agriculture in their spare time.  Only the four of them live in the house.  His wife and the two children are his dependents.\r\n\r\nMarto has earned a living in agriculture since his childhood.  His parents taught him farming.  His family was low income, so he preferred to earn a living farming and get the basic grains for his family's subsistence.  He also works as a day laborer on town construction projects.\r\n\r\nHe walks the two kilometers from his house to his crop in about 30 minutes.  Most of the time his wife and children also help him. The schedule isn't fixed, but they prefer to work in the morning.\r\n\r\nMarto will use the loan to harvest and store his corn seed and to buy soil amendments for his bean crop.  This will help him have a bigger crop, less loss, and a good harvest.  By applying the soil amendments he'll have a bigger and better crop.  He won't have to invest in buying these basic grains anymore because he'll grow and produce them himself.\r\n\r\nHe wants to produce a bigger corn crop and be able to sell it so he and his family can have a better quality of life.  He hopes his children will be honorable people in society and that they manage to finish their studies and become professionals with college degrees.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help Marto have greater possibilities to improve himself and his family.  He says he'll be able to improve himself with a lot of effort and work as well as with God's help.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to harvest and store corn seed and to buy soil amendments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T06:03:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618009,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is married with two children and they are both in school.

He has also worked in agriculture since he was little.\r\n\r\nHe works hard on his carpentry.  It is a field that he manages very well.  Even though he does not have a high-tech set of equipment, he does very well in the area.\r\n\r\nAlso, he has worked at planting corn and beans since he was very little.  He also raises small animals like chickens and pigs on a small scale.  Jobito works every day of the week at his house.  If they seek him out to do jobs outside of the community, he also does that.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy wood and tile.  He needs to make some changes to the house because the wood that he has is in bad condition.  He needs to improve it in order to have a more secure home.  There is a risk that it will break, and an accident could occur.\r\n\r\nHe has already ordered the wood, and it will cost him approximately $500.00.  He also estimated that the labor will cost $200.00.  He needs the rest for household expenses.\r\n\r\nJobito dreams of expanding his business and of buying more high-tech equipment (a table planer).  He states that he is totally prepared to support his children\u2019s education so that they are able to become professionals in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.66,"image":{"id":1452235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wood and tiles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jobito De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":106.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":126.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":163.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.35},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.69},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.66,"local_amount":123.66,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":123.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716648,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-14T02:45:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":617996,"name":"Fahri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fahri, 45, is a married man with three children between the ages of 13-17 years old.

She is married with three children. In 2005, Fatmata established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wanted to generate her own source of income. She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business.

The family doesn\u2019t have any other source of income, and unfortunately the guard salaries are not enough to cover food and daily costs. \r\n\r\nNatia has made multiple loan requests, without success, from the local financial institutions in order to start up a trading business. Her loan requests were rejected each time due to low income. Now, Natia\u2019s loan request has been approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and restart-ups with loans with soft conditions.

In 2010 Jharana, along with other three members from her locality, formed a group and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for develop their existing businesses. This is the third loan for Jharana from Mahashakti Foundation.  \r\n\r\nAt the time of accessing her first loan, her husband was accustomed to attend weekly markets of nearby villages for seasonal business. Out of their small income, they are maintaining their family in a low profile way. To improve her living condition and to earn some extra income, Jharana accessed a second loan and constructed a shed in her house and started selling grocery items. Now she is very much confident in running her business and has developed her grocery shop significantly. At present her monthly income is Rs.5,000 but that is not sufficient to lead a better life. So, she wants to take a further loan to add some extra items like rice, pulses (lentils), sugar, tea, flour, oil and other grocery items.  She has a cherished dream to educate her children in a better school\/college so they can get employment in the government sector.\r\n\r\nThe other three members are Susila, who has a fast food centre, and Sujata and Labanyabati who make and sell leaf plates. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1448397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase rice, pulses (lentils), sugar, tea, flour, oil and other grocery items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-16T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-15T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jharana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labanyabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sujata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T18:26:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618070,"name":"Om Shanti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Runukar, aged about 35 years, is the group leader for a four-member group from Bissam Cuttack, a town situated in Rayagada district of Odisha state in India.

adelante a sus hijos, cuatro de ellos ya se casaron y tienen sus propias familias. En la casa de habitaci\u00f3n solo vive con su esposo y dos de sus hijos quienes trabajan y le ayudan a ella en el hogar.\n\nSus hijos todos son bachilleres y no ha seguido apoy\u00e1ndolos en los estudios universitarios, por falta de dinero.\nBernardina, no estudio pues sus padres no quisieron, enviarla a estudiar ni a sus otros cinco hermanos que ella tiene.\n\n\nElla se dedica desde los 20 a\u00f1os de edad, a la elaboraci\u00f3n de hamacas, pues ella asisti\u00f3 a un taller en el municipio en donde aprendi\u00f3 y con el paso de los a\u00f1os ella ha ido perfeccionando el arte.

Se dedica hacer las hamacas despu\u00e9s de los quehaceres del hogar, por las tardes, sus hijos tambi\u00e9n le ayudan cuando vienen de trabajar la agricultura.\n\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es  para comprar una caja de hilo de seda, el cual esta valorada en $450 y el resto para otros gastos del hogar. Con ello,  podr\u00e1 elaborar mas hamacas y tendr\u00e1 mas ofertas para los clientes, pues en la temporada de noviembre y diciembre hay mas demanda por la \u00e9poca navide\u00f1a.\n\n\nEl sue\u00f1o, es seguir trabajando cada d\u00eda mas, para elaborar mas hamacas y poder vender mas.\nAdemas sue\u00f1a mejorar su vivienda, ya que las paredes y el piso es de tierra, esto lo lograra poco a poco mediante las ganancias que espera percibir de las ventas de las hamacas, esta ahorrando para ello.\n\n","en":"Bernardina is 53 years old and the mother of six grown children.  She married when she was 18 and is still together with her husband to this day.  Together they have worked very hard so their kids could get ahead.  Four of them are married and have their own families. She now lives with her husband and only two of their children who work and help around the house.\r\n\r\nHer children have all graduated from high school and she has not continued supporting them with university studies because she doesn't have the money. Bernarda did not go to school because her parents didn't want to send her or her five other siblings. She has been working at making hammocks since the age of 20.  She went to a workshop in her town where she learned, and over time she has perfected the art. She used to make the hammocks from husks, but now she uses silk and poly silk.  She makes 5 or 6 hammocks per month and sells them in the city where she also buys the materials.  It takes her 30 minutes to walk to where she catches the bus, and the ride into the city takes another 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nShe buys the materials to make the hammocks every 15 or 20 days and she makes them in the afternoon after finishing her household chores. Her children help her after they return from working in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy a box of silk yarn which costs $450 and she will use the rest for household expenses. With the loan, she will be able to make more hammocks and provide a better selection for her customers. In November and December demand increases because of the Christmas holidays. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue working more each day so she can make and sell more hammocks. She also dreams of improving her house since the walls and floor are made of dirt.  She will achieve this bit by bit with the earnings she hopes to make from the sale of her hammocks, and she is saving up for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":47.12,"image":{"id":1452767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy a box of silk yarn which is valued at $450, and she will use the rest  for other household expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":21.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":22.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":23.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":28.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":31.94},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.05},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.03,"local_amount":23.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":23.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505284,"comment":null},{"amount":24.09,"local_amount":24.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":24.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716365,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-17T04:41:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618087,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victor used the previous loan to buy salon equipment.

He is a bit of a workaholic and spends all his free time working, but would like to eventually settle down and make time for raising a family; he is currently 28 years old, unmarried and without children.    \r\n\r\nRecently, his flour-grinding machine broke down; to repair it, he is seeking a loan.  As soon as his flour grinder is repaired, he will be able to start working again.

He is married with two children who both attend school. His main source of income is the motorcycle taxi business (motorcycle for hire services). He started this business in 2007 and has managed to gain from it tremendously. He started building his house early 2012 with the available savings he had at the time and motorcycle earnings but later realized that he could not finish that house with only the savings.\n\nFrancis decided to request a loan from UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI) in order to finish the house.

Together with her husband, she is raising three children. In 1996, the couple started their own business of selling dishes from a rental container. She started this business with initial start-up capital in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Having been able to develop her business and attract loyal customers, Burulsun has an average monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to the hard work put into their business, the couple has been able to make home repairs and put up a fence. For the purpose of further increasing and expanding her business, Burulsun turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for a wholesale purchase of everyday use dishes for subsequent retail sale. Burulsun plans to invest the earnings from the loan to increase sales turnover.

Several years ago, her husband died and she had a really hard time coping with her family's expenses, as she was left nothing from her husband. She is the sole provider to three children. Her children are the light of her world and she is their rock. For more than four years, she has worked in a bank as a cleaning woman. Saodatkhon and her children live in poor living conditions.

He has three sons who are 9, 5, and 3 years old and a 7-year-old daughter. For five years, Safarali worked as a teacher of Tajik language and literature in his home town. He was not able to cover his family's expenses on a teacher's salary, which is why he took up fruit selling. His business is already six years old. He began his work with his brother so that he could learn marketing. Now he works alone, but he is not bored as his customers are his neighbors, and those who live close to him do not let him get bored. Safarali enjoys spending his time this way and brings something beneficial to his family's budget. He plans to buy more seasonal fruit and restock his supplies. He is requesting a loan for this purchase. When he gets his products, Safarali hopes to successfully sell them and thereby receive earnings and start repairs on his house. Safarali is getting ready for winter and is concerned about his children.

44-year-old Kadiatu from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married with four children aged between 13 years and 25 years. In 2003, Kadiatu established her charcoal business. She began her business because she needed to create income to support the home. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are transportation and price changes.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requires a loan in order to buy more bags of charcoal to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Kadiatu plans to change her business to a big provisions shop. She thanks you for your

Ganbaatar, 48 years old, lives with his wife and son in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. He has been transporting goods between districts within the capital using his own small truck for quite a while. His wife works at a filling station. Their son studies at university. The house they live in has deteriorated over the years and it needs some renovation, so he is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to buy necessary building materials such as cement, hardwood floors, vacuum-insulated windows and fiberglass. Using those materials, he will repair and renovate his house thus creating a comfortable and warm place for his family. Also the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and release fewer pollutants into air, a contribution to the efforts against air pollution.

Now, nearly 37 years later, Everlyn is managing the school of 70 students, grades K-8, with many of the same staff who started working with her at Queen of Angels.\r\n\r\nEverlyn is a passionate educator.

After graduation, she decided to stay and work in her neighborhood of Newark, NJ.\r\n\r\nAffirmation Academy, Everlyn describes, is challenging and academic-focused. The school utilizes an integrated literacy-based curriculum, and is unique in that it provides an inclusive, caring environment without excusing laziness. Classes are small, with fewer than 15 students in each. Students are encouraged to give back to their community as well.\r\n\r\nEventually, Everlyn would like to be able to reduce tuition costs for parents, and to become a charter school. Her vision is for Affirmation Academy to expand into a larger high school. \r\n\r\nIn August of this year, Everlyn started making moves toward this vision and transported the school to a new and better site in Newark.

It is also a profitable business and the main benefit is that he works at home, which means that he does not have to leave his loved ones.  Najmidin is a father of six children.  All of them still attend a school, and this is why he handles everything himself.  He is 45 years old and still in good shape.  This is why he is concurrently involved in agriculture, primarily in sowing rice and corn.  Currently, Najmidin wants to buy a pair of bulls in order to increase the headcount at the livestock yard.

Also, when he decides to marry, the business will help him provide a better quality of life for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":161.53,"image":{"id":1452850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase product to supply his store such as rice, beans, oil and sugar, as well as candies and snacks like churros and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joel Esau","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":58.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":56.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":58.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":61.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2015-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2015-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2015-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.35},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.15,"local_amount":107.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":107.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505286,"comment":null},{"amount":54.38,"local_amount":54.38,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":54.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T17:24:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618329,"name":"Pepe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pepe, a 40-year-old married woman with four children, has run a small business selling fish, crabs, and octopus in her community for three years.

lives in the Kericho area of Kenya, which lies in the tea growing region of the country. She has 2 children and has been doing this work for 5 years. Her primary income sources are milk and tea. She says that the most enjoyable thing about farming is the increased income she receives from dairy farming. Her biggest challenge is lack of financing. Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Moita.'\n\nHellen chose to pursue financing from Juhudi Kilimo to increase her income. She learned that Juhudi Kilimo helps fund low income earners during the organization's required micro-finance training session. Her highest monthly expenses are farming costs and this loan will benefit her family by helping her increase her income.\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Hellen owns cows and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

His primary income sources are milk, eggs, and transportation services.\n\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Selling his farm produce.' His biggest challenge is 'Watering crops in drought seasons and that is why he wants to purchase a water pump.' Animals on the farm have been given no names.\n\nSamuel was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'it has better loan terms.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'One can improve their lives through borrowing.'\n\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family.', Samuel replied 'Will improve his farming hence more income.'\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Samuel owns the following: a cow, poultry, a pump, and a motorcycle, but does not own a pig, a bicycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household solar power, a TV, and a DVD player, but does not have a mosquito net, electricity, running water, or a sewing machine.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23.4,"image":{"id":1443208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a water pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ndaragwa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-10-17T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-16T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3276.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3831.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.4,"local_amount":1970.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753598,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T06:41:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618333,"name":"Erma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erma is 57 years old and is widowed with three children.

She started with her own money and with the high price of food ingredients in Monrovia she thought of selling food ingredients. Ruth has requested a loan to purchase more Vita, pepper, salt, onions, oil, seasoned oil, etc., to attract more customers. In the future, Ruth hopes to be a big business woman and have her own store.

She is the single mother of two children.  The children\u2019s father does not support her because he is an alcoholic.  The children depend only upon her.  The two of them go to school.  The only support she has is from her mother because she lives in her house.\r\n\r\nAna has been selling tortillas in the market for two years.  She started the business at the time that she separated from her life partner.  She did this as a way of looking to support her two children.  She only walks four blocks from her house to the business because it is close by.  She starts working in her tortilla business at five in the morning, and she finishes at one in the afternoon.  She works eight hours a day every day without resting.  A cousin helps her; she also works every day with her.\r\n\r\nThe loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy corn and a propane gas griddle.  She will do better when she buys the corn.  It is cheaper wholesale, and it saves time.
