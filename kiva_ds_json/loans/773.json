He provides public transportation services using his mototaxi (a light, 3-wheeled passenger vehicle) in the city of Ica.  Ica is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours to the south of Lima, the nation's capital.  Ica is acclaimed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (the land of the sun).  This area is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps most of all, as the source of Pisco, the traditional national drink of Peru.  In this warm and dry climate we find the house and business of Jose.\r\n\r\nJose started his business by renting a mototaxi and working an average of 12 hours a day.  This allows him to have an income between 70-90 Peruvian soles a day, which helps him a lot to cover all of the expenses that he has to take on, such as the gas, the rent for the mototaxi, and other personal expenses.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva lenders, he will be able to do maintenance work on his vehicle, since over time some parts have been wearing out and he needs to change them as soon as possible.  This assistance will allow him to continue to improve his income, and with it he will be able to save, because in 6 months he plans to buy his own mototaxi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":951574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to do maintenance work on his mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-19T23:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-17T23:40:09Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Junior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.82,"local_amount":101.27,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142522,"comment":null},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":108.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271108,"comment":null},{"amount":438.13,"local_amount":1142.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322953812,"comment":null},{"amount":57.82,"local_amount":150.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088249,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T16:54:21Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":380980,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

Despite her age, she took a course six years ago to learn how to make detergent. Since then, she has dedicated herself to this activity and with the business income, Fabiola is able to cover household expenses for the home she shares with her husband. Fabiola is 51 years old. Her parents did not have stable income when she was young and the family struggled with many difficult financial situations. That's why Fabiola is so motivated now to create financial stability for her family. \r\n\r\nShe has many loyal customers who consistently order from her, but unfortunately her customers often pay on credit and Fabiola struggles to maintain enough working capital to keep her business running.

The competition in his region is very strong; this is why, he alternates this activity with a general store.

This is why he is searching for a loan that will allow him to buy merchandise such as vegetables, oils, grains, detergent, soft drinks, and liquor.

He has been working with our organization for over two years and used loans for consumer needs, commercial goals, etc.  Farrukh lives with his parents and constantly seeks advice from his father because Farrukh is young and does not have a lot of experience.

El sue\u00f1o de Luis Enrique siempre fue tener un negocio que le pueda generar ingresos necesarios con los cuales pueda atender las necesidades de su familia, y con el que pueda brindar empleo a las personas que m\u00e1s lo necesitan. Gracias a este negocio, Luis Enrique ha podido brindarles a sus 6 hijos todo lo que han necesitado y no han tenido que pasar por circunstancias adversas como si lo tuvo que hacer el en su tiempo. Luis Enrique tiene muy buenos pedidos por parte de sus clientes, pero a veces no puede abastecerlos todos por falta de materia prima para su producto; actualmente presenta la misma situaci\u00f3n y requiere de la compra de la materia prima para abastecer los pedidos de sus clientes, sin embargo, en el momento no dispone del capital necesario, por lo que aspira a que un cr\u00e9dito le permita acceder a la compra de esta materia prima y pueda seguir cumpliendo con todos los pedidos de sus clientes. Luis Enrique sue\u00f1a con que su negocio siga creciendo y que su familia pueda encontrar en el una buena oportunidad de empleo y generaci\u00f3n de ingresos.","en":"\r\nEnterprising and dedicated to his family are the two best ways to describe Luis Enrique who at the age of 52 has a sewing business that generates the income necessary to support his six children and his wife.  Luis Enrique decided to start his own sewing business 23 years ago and his business continues growing to this day offering very good quality products.\r\n\r\nLuis Enrique\u2019s dream is to always have a business that will generate the income necessary to tend to all his family\u2019s needs and that he can use to offer employment to those who need it most.  Thanks to this business, Luis Enrique has been able to provide his six children with everything they\u2019ve needed and they have not had to go through any adverse circumstances like he had to at some point in the past.  \r\n\r\nLuis Enrique has good pending orders from customers but sometimes he\u2019s unable to fill them for lack of raw materials for his products.  He\u2019s currently in that same situation and needs to buy raw materials to fill all his customer orders.  However, at present he lacks the necessary capital to do so which is why he\u2019s hoping for a loan that will allow him to access raw materials to continue filling customer orders.  Luis Enrique dreams with his business continuing to grow and that his family can find good opportunities for employment and income generation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":984168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

He learned the trade by helping his grandfather.  It is from his grandfather that he inherited this trade and under his grandfather that he learned the business.  Through his meat business, Alvaro has managed to provide for his family which consists of his wife and his five children who are between 4 and 26 years old.  When he got married and took on the responsibilities of a head of household, Alvaro turned to his knowledge of the trade and set up his own business in his in-laws' house.  More than 10 years ago, he acquired business premises in the main square in Arjona, on a plot of land belonging to his sister.  His business has done very well there.  He still has the same sales location and he distributes his produce to stores.  However, when his customer numbers increase, his working capital is not sufficient.  In particular, during holiday periods he needs to have his business stocked with larger quantities of produce.  For this reason, he is requesting a Kiva loan, which is the first loan he has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use his loan to buy beef in larger quantities and deliver larger quantities to the stores where he has already pre-sold it.  Alvaro's dream is to increase his income and provide his children with a better education.  Whilst this is happening, his investment profitability is 82.27% and it is from this point that he is planning his future, strengthening his business through his loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":984235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beef in

His family is the reason that he works diligently every day in his store. Benito set his store up some time ago as there were no such shop in his neighbourhood that could cover all the needs of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. So Benito was a pioneer in his area and thanks to this he acquired a large clientele. Benito has always wanted his wife and three children to have everything they need and he is always looking for ways to improve their quality of life. Benito's biggest dream is to buy the property where he has his store and set up a much better business there, where he can make improvements. This is the reason why he is looking to increase his income.\r\n\r\nHis store has a wide range of all types of stock, but he feels he lacks a cabinet where he can put products which require refrigeration. As he cannot store this products, at the moment Benito has had to stop selling this type of product. Hoping to improve his situation, Benito is looking to buy a refrigerated cabinet, but he does not have the necessary money available. For this reason Benito is hoping that a loan will allow him to buy this refrigerated cabinet to store more products which require refrigeration, therefore offering more products to his customers. Benito states that this cabinet will increase his sales considerably, as his customers are always suggesting he sell more refrigerated products. Benito hopes to be able to increase his income, fulfil his dream of buying the property where his store is and improving the quality of life of his wife and three children, offering them the best possible education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":984386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, because during this season Ana Sol is paying her children\u2019s school fees and also paying for merchandise she\u2019s purchased from her suppliers, she does not have sufficient capital to buy her display cases so is hoping for a loan that will allow her to have access to these display cases and that allows her to continue selling more each time thus reaching her dream of her children having the best possible wellbeing in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":985149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a display case.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-19T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Sol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56946},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58552},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60204},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61902},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63648},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65444},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67290},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69188},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71140},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73146},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75210},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":56946,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58823.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362180,"comment":null},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":58552,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60482.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075477,"comment":null},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":60134,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":62116.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902220,"comment":null},{"amount":34.7,"local_amount":61694,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63728.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326592,"comment":null},{"amount":35.79,"local_amount":63625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":65723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287431979,"comment":null},{"amount":37.16,"local_amount":66065,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":68243.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378029,"comment":null},{"amount":37.64,"local_amount":66970,"processed_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":69178.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432650,"comment":null},{"amount":0.93,"local_amount":1654,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1708.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617151,"comment":null},{"amount":204.95,"local_amount":364360,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":376374.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640102,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T14:46:36Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":374083,"name":"Mbaye Gueye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Mbaye est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 57 ans.

Thanks to this quality, he has been able to get ahead in life and provide for his wife's well-being.  Humberto used to work as a cleaner in a restaurant.  However, owing to the bad treatment that he received from his bosses and the fact that they didn't value him, he decided to start working for himself and make income on a different path.  Humberto started selling coffee from a small cart.  He gradually increased the products that he sells to his customers.  Humberto is well-known to his customers because his products are very good quality and he always provides them with the very best customer service.  Humberto says that he would like his business to grow and would like to set up a cafe in the future so that he can provide work for many people and save them from having to work for bad bosses.  In addition, Humberto also dreams of his business providing him with good income so that he can acquire his own home and provide his wife with more comforts and a better quality of life.  Whilst waiting for his sales to increase, Humberto would like to make some improvements to the little cart from which he sells his coffee and other products because, right now, it is very uncomfortable to transport and this stops him from making sales in different places.  Humberto is requesting a loan which will allow him to make improvements to his sales cart and which will also enable him to buy more products to offer his customers.  In this way, his sales will increase significantly as he will manage to get to more places and have a better selection of products to offer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":985177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to make improvements to the cart from which he sells his coffee and to buy more products so that he can offer a wider variety","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-19T18:50:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1020000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44271},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45520},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46804},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48125},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49482},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50878},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52313},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":53789},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55306},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56866},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58470},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60120},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61816},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63559},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65352},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67196},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69091},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71042}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.96,"local_amount":44271,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":45830.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362181,"comment":null},{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":46397,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":48031.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075478,"comment":null},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":47179,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":48840.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902221,"comment":null},{"amount":27.01,"local_amount":47919,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":49606.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326593,"comment":null},{"amount":27.62,"local_amount":48999,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50725.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287431980,"comment":null},{"amount":442.65,"local_amount":785235,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":812895.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378030,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T05:44:58Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382082,"name":"William Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"William se ha dedicado gran parte de su vida a buscar generar sus propios ingresos.

He graduated from the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute, where he obtained a speciality of engineer-radio technician.  Varuzhan is married and has two children -  a son and a daughter.  His son attends a paid division of the Yerevan Medical University, and daughter goes to a secondary school.  Varuzhan spent many years working as a rescuer at the Ministry of Emergency Situations.  Since 2011, he has been involved in a private entrepreneurship at a leased space, where he sells accessories (purses, school briefcases, belts, umbrellas, watches, glasses, etc.).  Varuzhan buys merchandise for his store once per month at wholesale markets in Yerevan.  He has many regular customers, who prefer to make their purchases specifically at his store, due to the quality of merchandise and Varuzhan's kindness.  He works without days off and is able to support his family, and pay for his son's university education, thanks to the earnings from this business.  Varuzhan needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 Armenia dram for the purchase of a large inventory of merchandise, such as purses, watches and belts, in anticipation of the New Year and Christmas holidays.  These types of merchandise sell especially well as presents at the current time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":955576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

However, because of the winter season lived these past three months, Giovanny does not have sufficient capital to do these improvements so is hoping that a loan will allow him to do the improvements and to buy more products to increase what he has available for his customers.

is a 21-year-old Lebanese married man living with his wife. Regardless of his young age, Hachem is doing the best he can to earn money and have his own family and children. For this reason, he decided to have his own business, so he opened his own poultry shop in 2008. He\u2019s a respectable person known for his good place and delicious food.

He is married to a businesswoman and has one child aged 17 years. In 2006, Anthony established his drinks, milk, ovaltine, liquor, sugar, butter, baby cream, and soap business. He began his business because his parents were business people and he grew up in the business even though he was going to school. But he paid more attention to the business and after he left school, he decided to continue with it. Working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, he earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Anthony requires a loan in order to purchase phones - 20 pieces @ Le200,000, savanna* drinks - 5 crates @ le120,000 and maltina** drinks - 4 crates @ Le100,000.  He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 750,000. In the future, Anthony plans to become an international businessman.  The business is good as it helps in adding to his capital. He hope to educate his child as he will make more profit out of it.  He usually experiences challenges due to the change in the exchange rate.  He doesn\u2019t have competition as his shop is the only cosmetic and provision shop in the area. He serves students from the nearby college and people around town.  He serves about 40 people a day.  He treats his customers well.  He is assisted by his wife, and usually buys his goods from Conakry, Guinea twice every month by public transport.  Anthony saves some of his profit and the rest he uses to buy more stock.

She works selling miscellaneous products such as silver jewelry, clothes and shoes. She will use her loan to purchase jewelry such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and some pairs of shoes for women and men. \r\n\r\nDamaris is a mother of three children and they still live together with their father (her long-term partner). Her most important challenge is to ensure that her children have a good future. She will make it possible by working hard. Damaris is receiving her fifth loan from Esperanza Internacional and, because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the re-investment she makes from each loan. She started her business three years ago and at that time only sold clothes. By taking loans, she started to introduce different products. She would like to save her profits so that she can pay for her children's university education and be able to provide them with a safe home as she also has plans to improve her house.\r\n\r\nIn this loan, we are adding three pictures. They were taken in their community. The three pictures complete the group of 15 members.

is 31-year-old Alieu. He is married to a trader and has two school-going children, ages 10 and 7 years. In 2004, Alieu established his provisions, toiletries and top cards (mobile) business. He did not go to school as his father does not respect education. His father was a cattle rearer and, when he grew up, he decided to join him in the same trade. During the war in Sierra Leone \u2013 specifically in his home town, Kabala \u2013 he lost all his cattle which forced him to come and settle in Makeni town, where he started as a peddler. Over some years, he raised a huge sum of money and opened a shop. Till now, his business has improved gradually.\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, Alieu earns about 1,892,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. He is assisted by family members. Alieu has already received and successfully repaid one loan. He would like a new loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires this loan in order to purchase cigarettes (Bond - 1 carton for 1,000,000 SLL and Gold Seal for 600,000 SLL), top-up cards (30,000 units for 38,000 SLL), sugar (2 bags for 260,000 SLL) and toothpaste (1 carton for 140,000 SLL). He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 473,000 SLL.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Alieu plans to open a bigger outlet to display his goods. He is nervous about the future prospects of his business because he wants to open a bigger shop so that he can be selling wholesale. The rise and fall in foreign currency can cause high prices in the cost of goods, and while meeting customers\u2019 needs, sometimes it affects his sales and reduces his profit. Competition is not high because he is the only retailer in the area dealing with these products. \r\n\r\nAlieu serves about 50 people per day. He serves people from around the city \u2013 at least 20 people per day. He also serves people from the surroundings and people from nearby villages.

He has lived with his partner for three years and they have a two-year-old son.  His partner supports him a lot in all that he does and he tells us that she's his right hand and she's the only one who listens to him when he's feeling bad or worried about problems that everyone faces.  They live together in Pedro's mother's house where she has generously offered them a room.\r\n\r\nPedro works \"from sun to sun\" as they say in Peru.  He has worked in transportation on his mototaxi for two years.  He gets up very early in the morning and sometimes he gets extra work doing things like helping in the fields when there's a harvest, doing construction work, or sometimes selling chickens.  He's a person with a thousand trades because if you find honest work, why not do it?  He works around 10 hours a day without stopping.  He thinks his business is going well because God is on his side and He is the only one who guides him down the right path and also because his son is the best motivation he could have to get ahead.\r\n\r\nPedro is very thankful to Kiva's lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to perform maintenance on his mototaxi and start a new business raising chickens.  This new business will allow him to earn more so he can improve his quality of life and give his son the best.  It will also allow him to keep saving to be able to start another business selling groceries and to keep growing so he can achieve his greatest dream, which is to offer his son a profession.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":985608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

He is 51 years old and the father of nine children, six of whom are now independent, while the remaining three are still minors.  Unfortunately, he is separated from his wife and his three children, 15-year-old Elizabeth, 12-year-old Carmen, and 7-year-old Walter.  However, he keeps in touch with his children and makes sure they are fed and educated.  Francisco has a very dynamic job, as he has to be constantly moving from one place to another.  He goes to different places close to the district he lives in, approaching small farms, large farms, and country houses looking for animals to buy.  Once he has the animals, he goes downtown to sell them.  He has been doing this work for 14 years now and so far it has allowed him to offer his family all the best.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to spend his time as it best suits him and because it lets him travel to many different places.  At the moment he has a good market that he can go to straight to without having to go all over wasting time.  His customers give him good prices and he takes home a good percentage of his sales, which results in good earnings for him.  Now he wants to keep working a lot to make his business grow.

Carlos Humberto is always seeking methods to be able to generate more income for his home.  He assures us that most important are his wife and son of 6 years, to whom he wants to offer everything that he needs to do well.  Approximately 4 and a half years ago, Carlos Humberto decided to set aside the activity of selling boxes in the food market of his region to open his own vegetable and fruit stand, as he saw that this activity would generate more income for his home.  Since then he has performed this activity and, thanks to his good service and the quality of the products that he offers his clients, he has been recognized in the sector and already has become  preferred by people at the moment they make their purchases.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the disadvantage that Carlos Humberto has with respect to the other people that sell vegetables and fruits in the same sector, is that Carlos Humberto does not have his own sales position, which means he must perform his sales on the outskirts of the other sales businesses.  For Carlos Humberto it has been very difficult to have to overcome said situation, and he declares that if he had his own sales location, his income would be a lot better than currently.  Carlos Humberto wants to save to be able to buy or lease a location in the future, for which he estimates that first he should begin to enlarge his sales.  It is for this reason that Carlos Humberto intends to buy a greater assortment of fruits and vegetables and to be able to make his business more attractive to the clients, offering a greater variety of products.

In his free time he enjoys taking walks and traveling.  As everyone knows, Per\u00fa is known for its delicious food and one of the dishes that he especially likes is \"Carapulcra con sopa seca\" (spicy Incan period cuisine).  Luis Pablo received a technical education but would like to have studied law.  He lives with his common-law wife who collects recyclable materials.  They have two children who are in high school.\r\n\r\nLuis is a taxi driver who works approximately 12 hours a day in the city of Ica.  He decided to go into this business because of the need for transporation in his community.  He averages 20 customers per day which provides an average income of 90 PEN a day.  On a good day he can earn as much as 120 PEN a day, which helps cover additional household expenses.  He believes the business is successful because he is responsible and honest and is also kind to the passengers.\r\n\r\nHe hopes Kiva lenders can help him provide maintenance for his vehicle, which is his main work tool.  He wants to pay back the loan over a 12-month period.  This support will mean he can keep his vehicle in good running condition and provide safety for customers.  He wants to buy another car in a few months so he can realize his dream: \"to have three cars to increase income for the household\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":956035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To provide maintenance for his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-23T10:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-21T10:40:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":205.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":209.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":223.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":236.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":242.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":253.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":270.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":281.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":290.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":301.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":155.78,"local_amount":415.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":419.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271115,"comment":null},{"amount":83.83,"local_amount":223.55,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":225.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993768,"comment":null},{"amount":84.57,"local_amount":225.54,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":227.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601673,"comment":null},{"amount":88.64,"local_amount":236.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":238.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090803,"comment":null},{"amount":712.18,"local_amount":1899.16,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221892,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-05T12:52:46Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383665,"name":"John Y.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is from Makeni city, in northern Sierra Leone.

","en":"Abduaziz is married and has three children.  He has been working with our organization since 2008.  He obtains loans for business expansion.  Abduaziz's wife helps him with the business and sits behind the counter, when he leaves to acquire merchandise.  He has been involved in retail sales for about 19 years.

quiera.  Los empresarios  surten sus negocios,  para responderle a sus clientes, con bebidas, comidas, artesan\u00edas, disfraces, carrosas y verbenas, en torno a la popularidad que emana de los ciudadanos de la ciudad y de turistas locales e internacionales; como un solo bloque estas fiestas del caribe colombiano llenas de color  y de acci\u00f3n logran que la gente  se aliste para deleitarse y desinhibirse  disfraz\u00e1ndose,  comprando y bailando. Esto es justamente lo que aprovechan los emprendedores como Arlett, que con su negocio de  venta de refrescos y bebidas fr\u00edas, planea tener un buen surtido para que sus utilidades en esta temporada se incrementen, aprovechando el derroche de alegr\u00eda de sus clientes. Su negocio naci\u00f3 justamente del carnaval de Barranquilla, cuando en el a\u00f1o 1989, vend\u00eda todos los productos de la empresa Bavaria,  en todos los eventos del Carnaval dela ciudad y en las fiestas de los municipios de los departamentos, para ello no necesitaba de capital de trabajo, pues los productos se los entregaban mediante el sistema de consignaci\u00f3n, es decir los que no vend\u00eda pod\u00eda devolverlos. Aqu\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar independientemente y poco a poco con su trabajo y sus ahorros,  logr\u00f3 comprar cervezas, gaseosas y poni maltas por cajas,  que vend\u00eda al detal; gradualmente con el incremento de su capital de trabajo,  logr\u00f3 comprar en mayor cantidad y as\u00ed mismo vender al  mayor. En la actualidad nuevamente se prepara para responder a esas  festividades   y debe estar muy bien dotada de todo lo que la alegr\u00eda de sus clientes le exige. Esta es la raz\u00f3n  por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 cervezas en mayor volumen, para venderlas en las diferentes festividades  y desde su propia vivienda contagiando a quien la conoce de mucha alegria. ","en":"Soon they will celebrate Carnival in Barranquilla, and all the people in the city are preparing to enjoy themselves, each in his or her own way. The merchants are stocking their businesses, so that they can respond to their customers' requests with beverages, foods, handicrafts, costumes, parade floats and fairs, because of the popularity of the festival with the citizens of the city and the local and international tourists. As a single block, these festivals of the Colombian Caribbean, full of color and action, enlist the people to enjoy themselves and lose their inhibitions, wearing costumes, buying, and dancing. \r\n\r\nThis, as it happens, is what the business people like Arlett take advantage of, with her business of soft drinks and cold beverages. She plans to have a good stock so that her profits increase during this season, taking advantage of the extravagance of happiness of her customers. As it happens, her business was born out of the Barranquilla Carnival, when, in the year 1989, she was selling all the products of the Bavaria company at all the Carnival events in the city and in the township festivals in the districts. To do this, she didn't need any working capital, since they gave her the products on the consignment system, that is, she could return what she didn't sell. There she leaned to work independently, and little by little, with her work and her savings, she managed to buy beer, soft drinks, and Pony Malt (a non-alcoholic malt beverage) by the case, which she sold retail. Gradually, with the increase in her working capital, she managed to buy in larger quantities and also to sell wholesale. Now she is preparing again to respond to these festivities and she should be very well stocked with everything that the happiness of her customers requires of her. This is the reason she has turned to her Kiva loan, the first financing she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy beer in large volume, to sell at the various festivities and from her own home, infecting those who know her with much happiness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":985515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

His children have been adding to this work, generating their own earnings.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to acquire a facility, so he does not have to move his work equipment and tools as he has so far. \r\n\r\nCurrently his business is growing and he needs to supply it very well because Carnival is approaching, one of the times in which his sales increase, especially the drinks and he needs to have good inventory of these products, as well as to repair his work equipment and maintain it.

\n","en":"Irina was born in 1969 in a simple family of a bus driver. Her mother worked as a construction site foreperson. After graduating from college in 1988, Irina found a job as a weaver at the Karabaltinsky carpet factory. In 1991 she met her husband and in 1992 gave birth to her daughter. After ten years of marriage, Irina again became single. In 2002, while looking for a source of income for her small family, Irina began selling men's and women's clothing at the market in the village of Kaindy, using 6000 som (KGS) as her starting capital. Since the trade was not very profitable, Irina sold off her inventory and from 2006 to 2007 worked as a saleswoman in retail.\r\n\r\nAs her next step, Irina decided to lease a nearby shop that sells detergents, soaps, and cosmetics. Thanks to her tenacity, persistence, and daily work, Irina was able to develop her business, using the profits to buy an apartment in the village. In order to expand the range of her products, Irina has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS). Irina plans to use the profits from this loan to finance her daughter's college education.
