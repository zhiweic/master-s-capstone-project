She is originally from Malpaisillo, a place that is located in the western part of the country. Gavina is characterized as a hardworking, responsible woman with a desire for self improvement. Unfortunately, she could not complete her studies because of a lack of economic resources, and because she had to work from an early age to help with household expenses.

es un hombre adulto de 61 a\u00f1os su vida ha sido un ejemplo de trabajo y esfuerzo, termin\u00f3 la escuela primaria en su ciudad natal Riobamba y luego se traslad\u00f3 para buscar mejores oportunidades con su familia. Trabaj\u00f3 desde muy joven, pues sus escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos no le permit\u00edan seguir prepar\u00e1ndose con la educaci\u00f3n secundaria. Luego de esto, el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s grande que \u00e9l ha tenido que atravesar es la separaci\u00f3n de su esposa con quien tuvo 5 hijos, quienes ya son adultos y tienen su vida independiente.  En la actualidad Mart\u00edn vive solo en la Parroquia Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nMart\u00edn gracias a un amigo aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de panadero y la ejerce por cuenta propia desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, este trabajo que demanda mucho sacrificio, fue el sustento para su familia  y para que sus hijos puedan educarse dignamente al menos hasta conseguir el bachillerato. Actualmente el menor de sus hijos, soltero y mayor de edad, le brinda ayuda en la panader\u00eda con la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan y la venta en el local y a domicilio. Invierte en este negocio por lo menos 6 horas cada d\u00eda desde antes que salga el sol para tener el pan listo y fresco para las primeras ventas de la ma\u00f1ana. En estos d\u00edas su hijo y \u00fanica ayuda en la panader\u00eda, ha tenido algunas complicaciones de salud, sin embargo Mart\u00edn no ha dejado de elaborar el pan que tanto gusta a sus clientes. Ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en el mantenimiento y reparaci\u00f3n de su horno, pues de esta forma evitar\u00e1 que \u00e9ste se aver\u00ede y le causa demoras en la elaboraci\u00f3n de pan como le ha estado sucediendo. Mart\u00edn espera realizar este tipo de mantenimientos cada a\u00f1o para evitar p\u00e9rdidas y que as\u00ed sus ingresos mejoren y poder mejor su estilo de vida para tener una buena vejez. Mart\u00edn agradece la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva para que personas alrededor del mundo ayuden a financiar este proyecto y tambi\u00e9n agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa porque es su primer cr\u00e9dito y se ha sentido muy c\u00f3modo con la atenci\u00f3n y asesor\u00eda que all\u00ed le han brindado. ","en":"Mart\u00edn, 61, sets an example of hard work and effort. He finished elementary school in his birth city of Riobamba and later moved in search of a better opportunities for his family. He started working at an early age as lack of money kept him from going to high school. Besides this, the greatest challenge he had to overcome was separating from his wife, with whom he has five grown, independent children.\r\n\r\nMart\u00edn lives alone in Chig\u00fcilpe parish, about 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. Here business is very active since the area has become a commerce link between Ecuador's mountains and coast. There are cement and cement-wood houses in the parish. The river attracts many tourists and residents, who practice a variety of sports and have a chance to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture while listening to tales as they sit around a fire or camp. Santo Domingo has the third largest population in the area. Farming, raising livestock, fishing, and manufacturing are the largest industries.\r\n\r\nMart\u00edn learned to make bread from a friend and has been working for himself for 15 years. The work demands sacrifice and has been his family's source of income and has allowed his children to study at least through high school. His youngest son is a single adult and helps Mart\u00edn in the bakery, making bread and selling in the shop and delivering to homes. He works from sunup for at least six hours each day so that the bread is ready and fresh for the first sales of the morning. His son is his only help in the bakery. Mart\u00edn has some health problems, but he hasn't stop making bread that his customers love.  \r\n\r\nHe needs a loan to repair and maintain his oven so that it doesn't break down and slow down production, as it doing now. Mart\u00edn expects to do this type of maintenance every year to avoid losses. This way his income increases, and he can live better now and in his later years. Mart\u00edn is grateful for Kiva loans that provide financing for projects around the world. He also thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for his first loan. He is happy with the service and counseling he has received.

Norayr has a higher education; he graduated from Yerevan Political Institute with a major in mechanical engineering. Norayr lives with his wife and two daughters in their hometown Kapan. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Norayr works in the Kapan Municipality. However as Norayr admitted, with his salary it is very difficult to adequately support his large family and therefore he decided to engage in business. \r\n\r\nNorayr has his own premises in Kapan, where he organizes a variety of business seminars and often rents the place for such events. He considers that Kapan needs these kinds of premises as this is a growing city with a huge potential, and he is certain that his conference room will soon host major seminar and workshops, which will focus on the development of Kapan and the Syunk district. \r\n\r\nNorayr needs a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian dram to complete the repair work on his conference room.

Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program includes provisions for business start-up and start again credits with soft repayment conditions for the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Venera plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell with a price markup among her villagers. This will increase the income of her family. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":964.59,"image":{"id":1310532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gori","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Venera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":109.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":112.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":114.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":118.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":120.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":127.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.51,"local_amount":97.51,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":97.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570334,"comment":null},{"amount":99.9,"local_amount":99.9,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":99.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968968,"comment":null},{"amount":101.2,"local_amount":101.2,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749386,"comment":null},{"amount":104.82,"local_amount":104.82,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":104.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613293,"comment":null},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":106.42,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":106.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857014,"comment":null},{"amount":109.11,"local_amount":109.11,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":109.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133670,"comment":null},{"amount":112.67,"local_amount":112.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":112.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107267,"comment":null},{"amount":114.72,"local_amount":114.72,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":114.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254837,"comment":null},{"amount":118.24,"local_amount":118.24,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":118.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019002,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T08:41:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536599,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana is a 25 year old single woman with no children.

There she has a sewing workshop where she repairs all kinds of garments, and she also creates clothing for women. She sells for cash and for credit to a customer base she built up before she was totally independent, when she was a worker with a large clothing manufacturer in the city of Barranquilla. Her business goal is to expand her clientele and grow in the market, but her income is not sufficient to invest in her business in order to reach new buyers with diversified products. This is the reason that she is taking out a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use it to buy materials and supplies such as clothing, thread and accessories, with which she will provide beautiful finishing touches to all of the garments, as requested by her best customers.

He is employed as a guard in one of his village's workshops.  However, his main activity is animal husbandry, which he does from home.\r\n\r\nAlihon is seriously involved in raising sheep. Every four to five months, he takes a couple of sheep to the market, he sells them at a good price, and then immediately buys another couple of lambs to be fattened.  He also shears sheep and sells their wool.  With the sheep's wool, Alihon's wife also makes balls of yarn; in that case the wool is sold at a higher price.

He is the father of a child and studied teaching. Currently, he works as a primary school teacher in a region very far from the mentioned village. He has to get up at 5:00 am to be on time at the school. In order to travel, his mean of transportation is a motorcycle he bought with great effort because his salary hardly covers the household expenses. However, he gives thanks to God for having a job.\r\n\r\nNow, he has the need to request a loan to buy spare parts to improve his motorcycle. Without it, it would be very difficult to travel to the area, because you can only go there by bicycle, motorcycle or horse.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting support to Kiva lenders to approve his application through Ceprodel so he will be able to carry out his investment.

Presently, he and his wife live in the village of Nor Arajadzor, near Kapan. Grenik is 67 years old, a pensioner, and a happy grandfather. He has a son and a daughter, who already have their own families.\r\n\r\nDespite his age, Grenik cannot imagine his life without his favourite work. He graduated from a technical college as a mechanic. He has been working as a tractor operator\/mechanic since then, and his services are in great demand. Grenik has his own tractor, which he uses to earn a living. While his wife works in their garden and takes care of their livestock, Grenik uses his tractor to work their neighbours' fields from morning til night. Grenik also has his own plot of land where he cultivates wheat and barley.\r\n\r\nDespite the hard work, Grenik is glad to be able to take care of his family without the help of his children, despite his advanced years, and takes pride in the fact that he occasionally gives his children a hand with their household chores.\r\n\r\nGrenik's tractor is very old and needs a major overhaul. It is already spring, and Grenik has many work orders. He is in a hurry to repair his tractor in time for the spring sowing. Grenik is requesting a Kiva loan of 800,000 Armenian dram to purchase spare parts for his agricultural equipment and to carry out major repairs on his tractor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":503.39,"image":{"id":1309555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

engaged in agriculture on his plot of land in Kapan. With his own hands, he has built a plastic-covered greenhouse where he grows herbs and vegetables such as parsley, radishes, coriander and onions. He sells fresh herbs year round at Kapan's markets, whereas sometimes bulk purchasers buy his herbs directly from his greenhouse. Armenak considers greenhouse cultivation of vegetables and herbs to be a very profitable agricultural activity as the profits far exceed the investment. That said, taking care of the greenhouse is hard work, and Armenak admits that it is necessary for him to love his work to get a good harvest. He constantly reads various technical literature about greenhouses and dreams of constructing a large technologically advanced greenhouse, with drip irrigation and a modern heating system, but currently lacks the funds and technical know-how to make this happen.\r\n\r\nArmenak lives in the city of Kapan together with his wife, son and daughter. His wife is a librarian, and in her spare time she gives her husband a hand in the greenhouse and also helps him take care of their cows and chickens. Armenak has post-secondary education as an engineer, but since there are no jobs available for him in Kapan, he prefers to work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nArmenak needs a loan to purchase plastic film covering for his greenhouse, as well as fodder for his chickens and cows."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1309589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

She runs a family business offering welding services from a workshop set up in her home, where she lives with her husband and two children, ages 11 and 4.  She came up with the idea for the business two years ago, and was able to count on her brother who is an expert welder.  They set up a joint venture.\r\n\r\nFor now, business expansion goals are larger than growing capacity and there is no financial support.

twenty years old. She lives with her parents and sister in Kapan. Her sister is a student. Her father does construction work and her mother has worked in clothing sales for many years now. \r\n\r\nAs it is difficult to support a large family in a small town like Kapan, in 2012 Anna decided to try her hand at business. She has been renting a stall and selling women's clothing at the Kapan fair for a year now. Before opening her own business Anna helped her mother in her stall and hence knows well the difficulties of the business. She already has regular clients not only in Kapan, but also in nearby villages. The secret to her success is that she is young and understands fashion trends well. She brings new clothing to Kapan from wholesale markets in Yerevan every month. \r\n\r\nAnna uses the profit from her business to help her parents support the family and her sister pay for school. Anna needs a loan of 2700 Armenian dollars to purchase spring and summer clothing in Yerevan for her stall in Kapan.

She is grateful for the opportunity given, since she can improve her work. For this reason, she promises to make her loan repayments on time.

He has worked in the Kapan ore processing plant for many years. He completed the Kapan technical school with a specialty in mining. Tomik lives with his wife in Kapan while his daughter and son live and work in Yerevan. They help their parents in Kapan. \r\n\r\nTomik's profession is very dangerous and harmful to human health. Although he has always loved his trade and happily worked as a miner despite the difficulties, Tomik is no longer so young and he decided to start working in another field. He and his wife have opened their own shop in Kapan. Tomik's wife purchases clothing at the wholesale markets in Yerevan and brings them to Kapan to resell. According to Tomik, it is more advantageous to work in sales than in mining in Armenia. Hence, he is satisfied with his new trade. \r\n\r\nTomik needs a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian dram in order to renovate his small clothing shop in Kapan. He is hoping for help from Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":497.26,"image":{"id":1309610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

","en":"Momajon lives in the J. Rumy region. She is 47 years old and married with two children. She has a university education in medicine, a field in which she worked for 13 years. \r\n\r\nFor the past three years Momajon has been working in arable farming. She grows wheat.

She lives in Kutaisi, West Georgia, with her sister and 23-year-old son.  Irma requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrma and her sister are working at the local market selling flowers, and they get a small monthly salary which is rarely enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Irma will rent a counter at the local market and purchase flowers at wholesale prices. She and her sister will then sell them with a price markup. The profit will be used for reinvesting and buying more flowers. As they are both experienced in this field, Irma hopes the business will be successful.

is 28 years old. He is married and lives with his wife in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia. Revaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a small monthly income earned by his wife working as saleslady at a local market. It totals 300 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRevaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Revaz will install gas equipment in his car, as it is much cheaper than petrol.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAnastasia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Anastasia will purchase a sewing machine and materials for sewing bedclothes. She has a basement in her house, which will be used as a workshop, so she will not have to pay money for rent. The bedclothes she makes will be sold locally at the markets and among her villagers. As Anastasia won\u2019t have too many expenses except buying materials, she hopes the business will be profitable. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family, and Anastasia will be able to provide a better life for her

She often gets orders from Bamako.\r\n\r\nTo increase her funds due to the concern of meeting her clientele's demands and to strengthen her business, she resorted to Soro Yiriwaso with which she has been in a relationship for 48 months. After 4 individual loans which were correctly and well repaid, Mariam is on her 5th individual loan which will be used to buy 20 bags of garlic and 15 bags of pepper. She gets her supplies in Siribala and Niono.\r\n\r\nMadam Mariam sells for cash and credit to a clientele consisting primarily of women. With this loan she plans to make a monthly profit of 70,000 FCFA. This will serve to take care of certain family expenses. Her ambition is to have a house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":727.27,"image":{"id":1311723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy condiments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030052,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819554,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678445,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924096,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207316,"comment":null},{"amount":90.9,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971987,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624654,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45746.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850692,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T22:43:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537507,"name":"Luis Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" LUIS ALFREDO tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad es casado tiene una hija, vive con la esposa y con la hija en la ciudad de Chimbo Provincia de Bol\u00edvar.\n\n LUIS ALFREDO se dedica al comercio de ganado vacuno y porcino.

A son of a cacao farmer, Benito got inspired to start his own cacao farm and started by planting 500 trees six years ago.  \n\nHaving been exposed to cacao farming from an early age, Benito has taken a liking to it and says that he enjoys everything that goes into cultivating this crop. Cacao is a permanent crop, so once planted and productive, cacao trees continue producing an average of 80 pods a year for decades onward. Maintaining the trees healthy requires cleaning the underbrush about three times a year, and pruning annually to keep production levels high. The hardest part of cacao farming for Benito is fighting monilia \u2013 an infectious fungal disease that makes the pods turn black and spreads through their pores. To prevent infection, farmers harvest the infected pods and stow them away from the trees. \n\nBesides cacao, the family grows rice, corn, beans and plantain for home use, and sells some of it locally. Benito is requesting this loan to do routinely cleaning of his farm and to bag 1,000 seeds for an expansion. Cacao is planted by first raising the seed in a bag filled with topsoil and then transplanting it into the ground. Cacao seedlings are ready for transplantation when they have four leaves, about six months after they are bagged. In the future, Benito hopes his kids can help him out in the growing farm. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":305.33,"image":{"id":1312058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Hire help to clean cacao field, bag seeds for expansion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150.61,"local_amount":301.22,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":304.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751704,"comment":null},{"amount":30.76,"local_amount":61.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":62.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993445,"comment":null},{"amount":48.41,"local_amount":96.81,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":97.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255614,"comment":null},{"amount":33.61,"local_amount":67.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136454,"comment":null},{"amount":41.94,"local_amount":83.88,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900670,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T20:32:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537574,"name":"Ponciano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ponciano, age 60, lives with his wife Escolastica in the village of San Jose, Toledo\u2019s cacao village extraordinaire. The couple has raised three children, two of who currently live in and are attending high school. The family has prioritized their children\u2019s education. \u201cWe put them in high school because the times have changed, before we all had to farm,\u201d Ponciano told Maya Mountain Cacao. \n\nPonciano started growing cacao at the time of new markets opening up for Belize-grown cacao some 25 years ago. The family manages two acres of cacao farm, with around 900 productive trees. For Ponciano, harvesting is the most rewarding part of cacao farming, as it means instant reimbursement for his work. The most challenging part of cacao farming, however, is cleaning and protecting the trees from animals. Cacao trees are especially vulnerable when they are young, at a time when enthusiastic rodents can overpower the tree by chewing on its soft roots. \n\nBesides cacao, the family grows the traditional package of corn and beans. Juan also works as a butcher, and sells meat in the market in Toledo district\u2019s capital Punta Gorda.

Having raised seven daughters who are now all out of the house, Juan and his wife Sabina take care of the household and the farm together, hiring outside help when necessary. \n\nJuan first got into cacao via a community cacao-farming project. A group of San Jose villagers mobilized into a community to request a land concession from the government on the condition of cultivating cacao in an agroforestry system. Agroforestry refers to a system of land use that involves a combination of agriculture and natural forestry, whereby cash crops like cacao are grown alongside timber trees, conserving the environment and providing a source of income for farmers.  \n\nCacao has been instrumental for the family to be able to meet their needs. For many Mayan villagers, it is the sole source of income, bringing liquidity to communities that traditionally barter for the goods and services they need. According to Juan, the best thing about cacao is that as long as you are able to work it, it brings in money. Cacao is a tree that once productive continues to yield pods for decades, on the average some 50 years. The most challenging part of growing cacao for Juan is harvesting, because it takes up a lot of time and effort, and is a very messy process.  Cacao pods house about 35 seeds surrounded by a sweet pulp. Harvesting cacao means cracking the pods open to scoop out the seeds, which can then be processed or sold fresh. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to hire help in the community to clean the cacao fields and for harvesting. Cleaning means clearing the underbrush to make trees accessible for harvest and pruning. Juan says he\u2019s gradually retiring from the farm and is getting ready to hand it over to his older daughter. In the meanwhile, he is happy to hire help to keep his cacao farm healthy and productive. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1312079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Hire help to clean and harvest cacao.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":302.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751706,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T19:21:15Z","paid_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536721,"name":"Anaweza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedeta is pictured on the right with her hand raised amongst her Anaweza Group members.

The start-up loan program envisions provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Nino will cover the costs of purchasing her stock of basic groceries. She owns a small commercial space where she will start a grocery store. As Nino doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, the business will be more profitable and with the profit she plans to increase the turnover in her trade business gradually.

The older children have jobs in the city and one is also a cacao farmer. \n\nVicente started growing cacao 27 years ago with a group of farmers that got a land concession to start cultivating cacao in an agroforestry system, growing cacao among timber trees that provide the necessary nutrients and shade for healthy production. They planted the cacao communally and divided it into parcels once the trees became productive. Cacao trees typically take three to five years to start producing pods, depending on the soil, shade and genetics. Vicente manages a two-acre farm with about 650 trees. \n\nFarming cacao is a little hard, says Vicente, however he likes that it is a permanent crop with harvest seasons that come and go for many years. The most challenging part of cacao farming is the constant battle with diseases, he says. Cacao farms in southern Belize are subject to monilia, an infectious fungal disease that makes pods black and spreads from its pores. \u201cIf you don\u2019t check often, the disease spreads up,\u201d Vicente told Maya Mountain Cacao in English, his second language after his native Maya Mopan. \n\nIn the future, Vicente hopes to expand his farm, something he has been planning but lacking capital to start. Cacao farm expansion requires hard work and time, starting from clearing the land for planting, raising seedlings in bags for six months, lining the land to map out where the plants will go and finally the transplantation into the ground. Moreover, cacao trees take three to five years to become productive, making expansion a long-term investment. For the meanwhile, Vicente is requesting this loan to clean and prune his two acres of cacao. Cleaning means clearing underbrush surrounding cacao trees to clear access to them for pruning and harvesting. Pruning is the process of cutting non-productive branches to increase yields in the coming season. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1312051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Hire help to clean and prune cacao.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-03-13T21:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-12T21:40:22Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicente","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751703,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993444,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255613,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136453,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900669,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-13T23:27:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":536790,"name":"Ruzanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruzanna is from the Siznak villagein the Syuniq region of Armenia.

She paints ceramic objects which decorate home interiors and sells them on credit to a customer base that she has created little by little since beginning her business. She still dreams of growing, but she needs to improve working conditions, because they affect her family. For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to move her workshop to a space behind the house. Through doing this, she will see a difference in her family's peace of mind.\r\n\r\nHer aim is to have a trading post in a special place where art and the artist converge, so that there is a place in

is 50 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has six children - four of whom are currently in school. For the past 18 years, Cathy has been working hard to manage her small local hotel which sells food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Cathy has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more inputs for her business and to buy more chairs for her small local hotel thereby helping Cathy to generate greater profits and therefore generate income. Cathy hopes that in the future she will be able to pay tuition for her children. \r\n\r\nCathy is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
