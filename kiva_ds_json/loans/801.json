","en":"Tukhtajon is 52 years old, married and is a mother of five children.  She is a successful, punctual and hardworking woman.  She has been a client of our organization since 2002 and has a good credit history.  Tukhtajon started with selling food products.  Despite the fact that she is an older woman, she traveled to wholesale markets no less than once per week to purchase inventories of food products.  Many people at the food market, where she worked, came to her for advice of how to set up sales in order to make a good profit.  Tukhtajon helped everyone without hesitation, and many people are grateful to her today.  Thanks to the earnings from her business, Tukhtajon put all of her children on their feet.  Three years ago, she decided to change her business focus and get involved in sales of children's clothing.  Tukhtajon is successful in this business.  It is now the beginning of spring, and Tukhtajon wants to obtain a spring selection of children's clothing and, thus, increase goods turnover.

The group is comprised of seven women and one man, and they are very hard workers.  Each member of this group is married and has a family.  Each one of them strives day to day to get ahead.  They devote themselves to raising animals like pigs, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.  They do this in order to get income and to help when they can with the expenses, be it for their children in school or for the store in the house.  \r\n\r\nAlso, because they do not work, which is to say that they do not have fixed employment that gives them a salary, they wish to invest part of their time in something that will be productive so they can support their life partners.  They want to do this so that, together, they can get ahead with all of their current necessities. It is worth mentioning that the people in this group are very responsible and hard working.  They like working in order to improve their lives.\r\n\r\nThe San Pedro community is one of the most advanced communities in the municipality.  It has all of the public services like water and drainage, a hospital, schools, and a gas station.  It is also a densely populated community with a lot of vegetation.  Additionally, the community has a lot of professionals and a lot of children attending school.  The group decided upon the name of \u201cAltamirano\u201d because it is the name of an important writer.\r\n\r\nThe names of the eight members are:\r\n\r\n1.-David S., age 42, is requesting his loan to buy 4 sheep and grass to feed them. \r\n2.-Victoria R., age 26, is requesting the loan to buy 2 sheep, 2 pigs, and feed to raise them. \r\n3.-Patricia C., age 34, is requesting her loan to buy 4 pigs, 30 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n4.-Ambrosia G., age 62, is requesting her loan to buy 2 pigs, 10 turkeys, 20 chickens, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n5.-Anita R., age 23, is requesting the loan to buy 5 pigs and food to raise them. \r\n6.-Crescencia G., age 45, is asking for the loan to buy 10 pigs, feed, and corn to raise them. \r\n7.-Teresa B., age 32, requested the loan to buy 5 sheep and grass to raise them. \r\n8.-Elvira S., age 43, is requesting the loan to buy 2 pigs, 2 sheep, grass, and corn to raise them. \r\n\r\nCrescencia, age 45, is the representative of the group.  She has been married for 27 years to Crisanto, who works as a bricklayer.  They have three children.  The oldest is 29 and married.  The next one is 20 and also married.  The youngest is 17 and is in the last year of high school.  \r\n\r\nCrescencia and her husband live in their own house, which is to say that they do not pay rent.  The reason that Crescencia decided to join this group is because of the desire to undertake a business.  \u201cI am a person who likes to buy and sell my animals.  This is because I realize that at times my husband does not have work, and I help him.  I am one of those people who devote themselves to many things in order to help with my expenses and to help my family.  I do not like to stop working.  I like taking care of the animals constantly so that I am not left without anything to get ahead,\u201d says Crescencia. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy business activity consists of, once I receive my loan, going to the farms where they sell \u201clechones\u201d (this is what the pigs are called when they are still very little).  I do not have to go very far because there is a farm in my community.  I buy the pigs that I am going to raise, and I take them to my house where I have my pen.  I feed them, and I inject them so they will grow.  When they grow I buy feed to fatten them, and then I sell them.  The people in my community know me, they know that I raise pigs, and they come to me,\u201d Crescencia says proudly.\r\n\r\nCrescencia says that so far, thanks to God, she has not had any difficulty carrying out her business activity.  She has not had illnesses, and things in general have gone well for her.\r\n\r\nCrescencia\u2019s goals are very clear.  She would like to make repairs to her house with the received income.  Above all, she wants her children to lack for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe loan that the instituci\u00f3n grants her will be a big help to her in reaching her goals and to continue making progress.\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1013069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pigs, sheep, and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crescencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":59000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7375},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14770.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044490,"comment":null},{"amount":1143.75,"local_amount":14750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":14770.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656681,"comment":null},{"amount":1715.63,"local_amount":22125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22156.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317353,"comment":null},{"amount":571.87,"local_amount":7375,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7385.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T22:16:51Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:17:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398176,"name":"Nilders Yoel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilders es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su pareja en la ciudad de Ica, El departamento de Ica es el \u00fanico de la costa sur formado por planicies, tambi\u00e9n llamadas llanuras coste\u00f1as, puesto que la Cordillera de los Andes se levanta muy al interior.

He lives with his wife and their 11-year son in the department of Ica. It is in the only coastal plains area on Peru's southern coast, where the Andes run farther inland. Around Ica there are vast deserts, like the Pampas de Lancha and Pampas de Villacur\u00ed, that experience intense heat, but there are also beaches, hot springs, varied marine plant-life, museums and excellent hotels. Peru is well known for its food, and Juan's favorite dish is a delicious traditional meal called \"Lomo Saltado.\" His wife supports him in everything. She works in recycling and helps with household expenses with her meager income. Juan has a fifth-grade education but would love to study civil engineering. Juan works as a motor-taxi driver, working around 10 hours and helping upward of 20 customers a day. He believes the business is going well because he's very careful when he drives and is friendly and respectful to his customers. Juan is very grateful to Kiva lenders because this is the second time you have supported him. This time, he plans to use the loan for general maintenance and repairs on his two vehicles so he can purchase new tires. In this way he can continue working in a safe manner and keep trying to fulfill his biggest dream: for his son to find a good profession."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1017152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain and repair his vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T03:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T03:00:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":259.43},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":261.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":274.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":281.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":294.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":302.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":313.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":326.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":336.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":349.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.29,"local_amount":259.43,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":260.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269994056,"comment":null},{"amount":98.16,"local_amount":261.77,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":262.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601956,"comment":null},{"amount":102.88,"local_amount":274.34,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":275.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091077,"comment":null},{"amount":105.52,"local_amount":281.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":282.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222142,"comment":null},{"amount":721.15,"local_amount":1923.06,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1930.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298210,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T11:36:15Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398503,"name":"Luz Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz es una madre de familia muy responsable, tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad y 2 hijos, vive junto a su esposo, la casa en la que viven esta ubicada en el Pueblo Joven de nombre \u201cLa Matanza\u201d ubicado en la provincia de Morrop\u00f3n en Piura, en el pueblo donde vive sus habitantes normalmente se dedican a la agricultura y comercializaci\u00f3n de ganado.\n\nLuz es una joven madre de familia que tiene muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n, por lo que ha iniciado su negocio de venta de chicha de jora (bebida oriunda de los incas), ella desde muy tempranas horas inicia la preparaci\u00f3n de sus insumos con los que obtendr\u00e1 la chicha para ser comercializada a sus vecinos y personas que trabajan en campo, ya su negocio lo viene manejando hace dos a\u00f1os aproximadamente, y es que el apoyo que le brinda su esposo es suma importancia ya que le permitir\u00e1 lograr sus objetivos.\n\nElla quiere seguir creciendo en su negocio, y para poder atender a sus clientes necesita de accesorios como cocina, ollas, sillas y mesas en las que pueda brindar una mejor atenci\u00f3n, y por eso que esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito en Edpyme Alternativa por un monto de 1008 Nuevos Soles los cuales invertir\u00e1 en la compra de sus accesorios.\n\nPues anteriormente ya ha tenido otros prestamos con nuestra instituci\u00f3n demostrando su alto grado de responsabilidad en cuanto a sus pagos.\n","en":"Luz is a very responsible mother of a family.

loves and works very hard so they will have it better than her. She lives in the district of Santiago, department of Ica, Peru. This district is known for agriculture, its primary activity, and the generosity of its inhabitants. In her free time, Miriam likes to play volleyball with relatives and neighbors. Like any good Peruvian she loves food, and one of her favorite dishes is ceviche. With a lot of hard work she was able to start a business raising and selling pigs. She gets up very early to feed her pigs and always keeps the pen clean. She dedicates around four hours a day to this job, and she also works in quality control at a farm in the district. She believes her business is going well because she raises the pigs in a clean environment and her customers are very confident in buying the pork. Miriam is very grateful for Kiva lenders because thanks to your support she will be able to buy land so she can have a bigger space for her animals and be able to raise more pigs. In this way, she will continue working so she can fulfill her biggest dream: see her children become successful, have her own home and have a tiny farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1017167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase land

He likes what he does a lot since it allows him to have a good income, apart from giving him sufficient time for other activities.

is a twenty-four-year-old young man. He is employed, but gets a low salary. Sa'ed is preparing to marry soon. His salary isn't enough to cover the wedding expenses as he wants to purchase bedroom furniture and living room furniture. \n\nSa'ed is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing the necessary home furniture to prepare a suitable home to live in with his wife. Sa'ed is photographed in the FATEN branch office.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

is a hardworking man who is married to Cresencia.

Another reason is that his family has a large household. Though he didn't continue his studies,  he is able to stand independently from his family. He got married in 1980 and started to raise hogs. By that time, Omar was encouraged to raise a corn crop and engage in the transportation business. With his dedication to improve their living conditions, he endures all the struggles in running his business. Nowadays, he is raising two sows and fattening seven. With the number of hogs he is raising, his budget is not sufficient because of the expensive price of the feed and vaccine for the hogs.The income generated from his farming and vulcanizing shop business was used for his children's education. So,Omar is in need of additional capital amounting to PHP 20,000, which will be used to buy stock feed for his livestock business.Through his additional capital,and continuous financial support by the lenders, he will be able to sustain their daily needs and make his business grow. In this way, Omar would save some for security purposes when he and his wife got weak.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":997748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy feed for his livestock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

working as a technician for five and a half years, Rick branched out and started his own event planning company in 1993. His company is now a full service party planner, which organizes corporate events, private parties, karaoke nights, weddings and much more. Along with the planning aspect, he also provides DJ services when needed and has recently purchased a photobooth, which he rents for his events as well as other independent events. Currently, the company gets 90% of their clients from referrals and word of mouth. However, they continue to see steady growth. Rick would like to see his business continue to grow and thinks that more consistent growth would occur with a better marketing scheme.

received his first job in the office furniture industry as a customer service assistant and was able to work his way up into sales in a very short period. Now, with 15 years of experience, John owns and operates his own full service office furniture dealership, which provides delivery services, installation, and space management consulting. After seven years with his previous employer, John branched off and started his own small business with the help of a few of his previous customers. He now represents 45 repeat customers and has three full time employees. As the owner, John wears many hats. Performing many tasks from unloading furniture to managing the warehouse, his main concentration is on sales. Over the last year, he has been working very hard and has lined up numerous large accounts, making 2012 the most profitable year yet. To provide for these new accounts, he would like to set up another warehouse and buy more inventories.  With this loan, John hopes to grow his business exponentially in 2012."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6111.16,"image":{"id":1006464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

","en":"Abduali is married and the conscientious father of two children.  For more than 10 years he has traded in cattle and has grown crops.  He has been accustomed to physical labor since childhood and because of this, he loves to work in the fields.  After his son's marriage, his financial position worsened, but through it all he keeps working hard to restore it.

However, owing to violent conflicts which existed at that time in her region, she had to close her store for a long time. Just recently Maria reopened her store and little by little has been stocking it with household products. In hopes of continuing to stock her store and being able to have a store which fulfills all of her customers' needs, Maria seeks a loan which allows her the possibility of accessing the purchase of household products in order to keep stocking her shelves. \r\n\r\nMaria hopes to fulfill her dream of having a large store and of continuing to supply income to her home with which to cover the needs of her husband and her four children. Furthermore, Maria dreams that her family would have a better quality of life and that her children would have access to a quality education. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":998031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase basic household staples with which to stock her store.

Lucila is married and the mother of 2 daughters, one of whom has Down\u2019s syndrome and requires her mother\u2019s attention all the time.  Because her husband\u2019s work doesn\u2019t generate sufficient income to support the household, Lucila decided to start a business some time ago selling personal products by catalog.  Thanks to this activity, she is able to make up for the expenses that are not covered for the home.  Lucila cannot tend to her customers for more time than she currently offers them because she must take care of her daughters.  For this reason, she has not been able to grow her business, despite the fact that she has a good amount of orders.  Regardless, Lucila has some customers that do not require a lot of time and attention, and these placed good orders with her in large quantities.  Thanks to this, the business can continue to function.  With the intention to make delivery of a large order that a client has placed, Lucila needs to buy the requested products from her suppliers.

For this reason, because her husband does not generate sufficient income to guarantee a good quality of life, Luz Marina decided to start a business selling personal products by catalog.  Luz Marina is married and the mother of 1 son who is 5 years old, for whom she wants to provide the best education possible starting at an early age.  Luz Marina has, by means of her business, a very good alternate mode of generating income thanks to the fact that she can concurrently care for her son.  Luz Marina learned this activity from a friend who had carried out this type of work for a long time and invited her to attend product promotional meetings.  Thanks to the excellent attention Luz Marina offers, her business has seen sales increase considerably.  She has been able to generate a good income and, little by little, improve her family\u2019s standard of living.  With the desire to deliver a large order from a client of hers, Luz Marina must purchase the necessary products from her provider.  However, she currently does not have sufficient capital to do this.  For this reason, she has the hope that a loan will afford her the possibility to buy the personal products so that she can fill the large order that her customer has placed.\r\n\r\nLuz Marina hopes to continue tending to her business, and that it continues to generate income for the home so she can slowly get ahead.

les ha querido brindar todo lo necesario. Maria Zoraida aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la fabricaci\u00f3n de arepas desde hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os, pues trabaj\u00f3 para una f\u00e1brica de arepas de su municipio. Hace por lo menos 5 meses decidi\u00f3 independizarse y mont\u00f3 su propia f\u00e1brica de arepas, que ha ido construyendo poco a poco a medida que el capital disponible se lo permite. Maria Zoraida actualmente vende sus arepas a algunas tiendas y familias de su municipio, y gracias a esto genera ingresos para el sostenimiento de su hogar junto con su esposo. La manera en que Maria Zoraida fabrica sus arepas es todav\u00eda muy artesanal, pues no cuenta ni con la maquinaria ni con las herramientas adecuadas para fabricar industrialmente sus arepas. Esto hace que no pueda producir en grandes cantidades y a\u00fan tenga que vender pocas cantidades de su producto. Gracias a que sus arepas son muy apetecidas por sus clientes, quienes le han hecho grandes pedidos que no ha podido satisfacer por la poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n que tiene, Maria Zoraida ha tenido la motivaci\u00f3n de comprar algunas m\u00e1quinas y herramientas industriales para la producci\u00f3n de sus arepas adem\u00e1s de la adecuaci\u00f3n de su sitio de trabajo.

She is married and the mother of 3 children, to whom she has always wanted to give what they need. Maria Zoraida has been learning this activity of making arepas since she was 5 years old, because she worked for an arepas factory in her town. At least 5 months ago, she decided to go off on her own and she opened her own arepa factory, that she has been building little by little, as capital availability has permitted. Maria Zoraida now sells her arepas to stores and families in her town. Thanks to this, she generates income to support her home with her husband. The way that Maria Zoraida makes her arepas is still very artisanal, because she doesn't have the machinery or the tools to produce her arepas industrially. This causes her to not be able to produce great quantities and she still has to sell her product in small quantities. Thanks to her arepas being much in demand by her customers, who have made orders she can't fill due to low production capacity, Maria Zoraida is motivated to buy some industrial machinery and tools for arepa production, as well as outfitting her workplace. That is why Maria Zoraida aspires to having the loan give her the possibility to access the purchase of machinery for making arepas and outfitting her workplace, in order to be able to make her product in large quantities and be able to respond to her customers' orders.  \r\n\r\nMaria Zoraida hopes that her business will grow and be able to generate employment for people who need it the most, and that her family will be able to enjoy the financial benefits that this can bring her.

However, her desire to do well has allowed her to overcome her difficulties and make progress together with her family.  Seven years ago Eugenia's husband died and she was left as a single mother responsible for 5 children, most of whom still needed their mother's care.  Seeing that she needed to make income for her household, Eugenia started offering a dressmaking service to third parties.  She learned this trade a long time ago and used to work in it periodically.  Thanks to the good quality of her products, Eugenia's work became the standard in her region and now she has very good orders from her customers.  She currently has a large order to make uniforms as the beginning of the school year is approaching.  For this reason, she is looking to buy the raw materials she needs such as fabric and threads.  As she doesn't have enough capital to buy all the materials she needs, Eugenia hopes to receive a loan which will enable her to buy fabric and threads for making the uniforms that her customer has ordered.\r\n\r\nEugenia dreams of her workshop continuing to grow and being able to provide work in the future to single mothers who find themselves in the same situation as her.  She also dreams of her children becoming professionals with good jobs that will allow them to get ahead in life and form their own families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":998177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy raw materials such as fabric and threads for making uniforms that a customer has ordered","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Rionegro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81747},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84049},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86415},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88848},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91349},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93921},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96565},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99284},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102079},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104953},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107908},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110946},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114070},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117281},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120585}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.87},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":165441,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":169218.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075673,"comment":null},{"amount":48.11,"local_amount":84902,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":86840.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326757,"comment":null},{"amount":105.07,"local_amount":185422,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":189655.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432145,"comment":null},{"amount":51.32,"local_amount":90564,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":92631.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432807,"comment":null},{"amount":54.72,"local_amount":96581,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":98786.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617298,"comment":null},{"amount":116.4,"local_amount":205415,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":210105.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640234,"comment":null},{"amount":122.66,"local_amount":216453,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":221395.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165475,"comment":null},{"amount":257.97,"local_amount":455222,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":465616.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097990,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-01T22:17:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387943,"name":"Jesus Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jesus Antonio es una persona ampliamente reconocida en su municipio gracias a que es una persona muy carism\u00e1tica y muy trabajadora.

Because the father of her son abandoned her, she has to guarantee sustenance for her son alone.  She started looking for business alternatives, and found a good opportunity in food sales.  Alejandra sells plates of food to the residents of her region, who have her cooking as reference for its excellent quality.

Because of this, Alejandra has had to turn down some orders from customers and sell her food little by little so it doesn\u2019t go bad.  With the desire to improve this situation, Alejandra hopes that a loan will allow her to buy a refrigerator where she can preserve her prepared food until it\u2019s served.\r\n\r\nAlejandra hopes that this will allow her to augment her income considerably, since she\u2019ll be able to tend to customers that she may have previously had to turn down.

She also hopes to be able to open a store one day where she will sell a wide variety of products and where she could employ people who also need to make money to support their families. Maria del Carmen would love for her son to get a better education and to go to college one day, which would help him get a well-paid job in the future. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":998262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more personal use products and fulfill large orders from her customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93172},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95802},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98506},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101287},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104146},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107087}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.67,"local_amount":191433,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":201563,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075677,"comment":null},{"amount":57.25,"local_amount":98148,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":103341.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902403,"comment":null},{"amount":58.76,"local_amount":100738,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":106068.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326761,"comment":null},{"amount":122.32,"local_amount":209681,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":220776.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378191,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T15:52:17Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387733,"name":"Jeanalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At 41 years old, Jeanalyn is still single.

She is married and has three children who she has always wanted to provide with the best she can.  As her husband's wage was not enough to cover their household expenses, Nancy decided to start working and contributing towards their household income.  She started off working in her sister's cafe and, after a while, her sister sold it to her.  Nancy has owned the cafe for approximately one year and, thanks to her good service, she has been gradually growing it.  She often has orders from customers that she cannot fill because she doesn't have much stock.  With the aim of changing this situation, further growing her cafe and making it more attractive for her customers, Nancy is looking for a loan which will enable her to buy products for her cafe such as snacks, drinks, etc. This will enable her to  increase the variety of products she has to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nNancy hopes that her cafe will continue to grow and that her sales will increase over time so that she can make more income that her household needs in order to enjoy a better quality of life.

Jorge se encuentra casado y es padre de 1 hijo, el cual por su corta edad requiere de mucha atenci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n genera grandes gastos para su familia, es por esto que Jorge siempre busca aumentar sus ingresos para poder ofrecerle a su hijo un crecimiento de calidad y a su esposa ofrecerle una mejor calidad de vida. Jorge en la actividad de la instalaci\u00f3n de redes de gas es muy eficiente, y gracias a esto es muy reconocido entre sus clientes y esto le ha llevado a tener muy buenos contratos. Sin embargo, la actividad tiene muchos tiempos muertos, donde Jorge no encuentra contratos para desarrollar su actividad y tiene conflictos para la generaci\u00f3n de ingresos para su hogar. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Jorge ha aprendido la actividad de la instalaci\u00f3n de redes el\u00e9ctricas y gracias a esto ha podido diversificar su trabajo y poder tener menos riesgo a quedarse sin ingresos para su hogar. Gracias que ahora desempe\u00f1a esta actividad con buena calidad, Jorge quiere comprar sus herramientas para trabajar, por lo que busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de herramientas para desempe\u00f1ar la actividad de la instalaci\u00f3n de redes el\u00e9ctricas, y tener as\u00ed una nueva fuente de ingresos paralela a la instalaci\u00f3n de redes de gas.\n\nJorge espera que de esta manera sus ingresos no se vuelvan a ver afectados, pues en esta nueva actividad encuentra mucho trabajo, y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 ofrecerle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica que les permita tener mayores oportunidades de progresar.\n","en":"Jorge has been installing gas lines for approximately 12 years.  He learned this trade from a family member and it makes him the income he needs to support his household.  Jorge is married and has one child who, because of his young age, needs a lot of care and also creates large expenses for his family.  For this reason, Jorge is always looking to increase his income so that he can offer his son a good childhood and offer his wife a better quality of life.  Jorge is very efficient in his work as a gas installer and he is very well known among his customers.  This has meant that he gets very good contracts.  However, the business has many times when there isn't much work and Jorge cannot find contracts.  This makes it hard for him to make income for his household.  With the aim of improving this situation, Jorge has learned how to work as an electricity installer and has been able to diversify his work so that he runs less risk of being unable to make income for his household.  Now that he carries out this business well, Jorge would like to buy some work tools.  He is looking for a loan that will enable him to buy tools for carrying out his work as an electricity installer.  This will give him an additional source of income on top of the money he makes installing gas lines.\r\n\r\nJorge hopes that a lack of income will no longer cause him problems as he is finding a lot of work in this new business.  This means he will be able to offer his family a better quality of life and financial stability which will give them more opportunities for making progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":998681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"to buy tools so that he can carry out an additional business installing electricity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":123134},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":126607},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130178},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133851},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137626},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":141509},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":145501},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":149605},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":153825},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142.8,"local_amount":249895,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256320.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075681,"comment":null},{"amount":153.22,"local_amount":268131,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275025.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326763,"comment":null},{"amount":161.18,"local_amount":282063,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":289316.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378194,"comment":null},{"amount":79.03,"local_amount":138317,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":141873.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432813,"comment":null},{"amount":263.77,"local_amount":461594,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":473463.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T22:08:10Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394853,"name":"M\u00e8d\u00e9djigb\u00e9 C\u00e9line","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"M\u00e8d\u00e9djigb\u00e9 C\u00e9line est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de quatre enfants.

Hernando se ha visto muy golpeado por la gran competencia que existen en su regi\u00f3n, por lo que ha implementado nuevos servicios como el servicio de impresi\u00f3n de trabajos, plastificaci\u00f3n de documentos, entre otros. Gracias a la buena clientela que ha acogido su alquiler de videojuegos e Internet, Hernando requiere de m\u00e1s aparatos que le permitan atender a todos sus clientes.

","en":"Olimjon is an honest and hard-working family man and a father of four.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he privatized the plot of land cultivated by his parents. Olimjon has many years of experience not only in livestock breeding but also in agriculture. Unfortunately, his business has been affected by the crisis in the country.

Libardo se encuentra casado y es padre de 6 hijos, a quienes siempre les brinda una buena educaci\u00f3n y quiere ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida. Libardo se dedica desde hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os a la actividad de la compra y venta de frutas y verduras, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 trabajando para una empresa que hac\u00eda esto pero al ver que su empleo era muy mal remunerado decidi\u00f3 independizarse y sacar su propio negocio adelante. Libardo compra las cosechas de los agricultores de las veredas cercanas a su vivienda y luego las transporta hasta la ciudad para venderla en la plaza de mercados. De esta manera, Libardo afirma que el genera sus ingresos y a la vez le brinda una ayuda a los agricultores porque ellos no tienen como llevar sus productos hasta la ciudad, y la empresa que hace esto, para la que trabajaba Libardo, abusaba del trabajo de los Agricultores. Libardo le compra la mercanc\u00eda a los agricultores a cr\u00e9dito, pues no cuenta con un buen capital para poderla comprar a contado, sin embargo, Libardo quiere cambiar esta situaci\u00f3n, pues a menudo los agricultores necesitan el dinero para poder sostener sus propios gastos. Es por esto que Libardo aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de las frutas y verduras de contado, permiti\u00e9ndoles a los agricultores recibir el dinero de contado y mejorar su calidad de vida.\n\nLibardo espera que de esta manera tanto su calidad de vida, como la de los agricultores se vean beneficiadas y en un futuro puedan sacar en conjunto la regi\u00f3n adelante. Libardo aspira a que sus hijos puedan gozar de una mejor calidad de vida y puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria, adem\u00e1s, quiere que su esposa pueda tener mejor calidad de vida y toda su familia mejores oportunidades de progreso.\n","en":"Libardo is well-known in his area for his great charisma and good will in helping other people.  He is married and the father of six children to whom he has always given a good education, offering them the best he could.  For approximately ten years Libardo has been buying and selling fruit and vegetables.  He learned the trade while working for a company in the sector, but since he felt his job was not well paid he decided to become independent and set up his own business.  Libardo buys produce from farmers near his home and then travels to the city to sell it at the markets.  This way Libardo generates his own income and also helps the farmers because they have no way of transporting the goods to the city.  The company that does this type of thing, which is where Libardo worked before, used to abuse the farmers.  Libardo buys from the farmers on credit since he does not have enough capital to buy in cash.  But he wants to change this situation because the farmers sometimes need cash to cover their own expenses.  So Libardo is requesting a loan to buy fruit and vegetables in cash, which means the farmers will receive cash and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe is also hoping to improve his own quality of life since the farmers will be better off and this will benefit the region in the future.  Libardo wants his children to have a better lifestyle and access to a university education.  He also wants a better lifestyle for his wife and more opportunities for his

She lives with her husband and children, who range in age from 16 to 12.  She is a very hard worker who, for ten years, has been involved in farming, raising pigs and livestock.  Her parents taught her the trade at the age of 18 when she used to go with them to the fields and learned how to grow corn, squash, etc.  Now she does her own farming which is the source of income for her household.  She has to travel by bus, a 45-minute ride, to the city where she buys farm supplies with her children.\r\n\r\nThe loan Santos is requesting is to buy four sacks of sulphate, two sacks of formula and the rest to buy a calf.  With this investment she will be able to plant corn and squash, which are her two main crops.  With the income from the squash she will pay back the loan.

Nevertheless, her desire to get ahead and the quality of being a hard worker have made her overcome these adversities and continue making progress in her life.  Carmen is a single mother and head of the family with one child, a three year old.  The child\u2019s father never wanted to contribute to his support.  Carmen had to support him on her own.\r\n\r\nBecause Carmen was not employed and was only studying, she had to abandon her studies.  She had to find employment that would allow her to generate sufficient income to be able to support her son\u2019s expenses.  Carmen then learned the business activity of selling personal products like deodorants, creams, and lotions, among others, and selling clothes.  She makes all of these sales through catalogs.  Thanks to this she is able to generate income.\r\n\r\nThe work has served Carmen well because it gives her good income, and it does not require her to be available full time.  This allows her to spend time with her son and to be able to take care of him while he is growing up.  Thanks to the good service that Carmen offers, her sales have increased more and more.  Thanks to this her family is able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe currently has a large clothing order from one of her customers.  She needs to buy merchandise from her provider, but she does not have enough money to make this purchase.

Eduardo hace aproximadamente 20 a\u00f1os trabajaba en su propio taller de metales, fabricaba tejas en acr\u00edlico y acero. Por circunstancias adversas y ajenas a su voluntad, tuvo que abandonar su trabajo y mudarse hacia otra ciudad, donde no tuvo muchas oportunidades de empleo. Hace aproximadamente 6 meses regres\u00f3 a si ciudad y quiso seguir trabajando en su empleo de tejas de acr\u00edlico y acero, pero ya no contaba con las herramientas, ni el local, ni las materias primas. Con muchas fuerzas y ganas de trabajo sali\u00f3 adelante y consigui\u00f3 nuevamente la maquinaria, sin embargo sigue con muy poco inventario de materia prima y se encuentra ubicado en un local que es arrendado y no le brinda todas las prestaciones necesarias para desempe\u00f1ar su actividad como debe ser. Es por esto que ahora que Eduardo tiene un gran pedido por parte de un cliente, quiere aprovechar para poder generar los ingresos necesarios para ubicarse en un local mejor, en el cual pueda trabajar m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo y le brinde las prestaciones necesarias. Para poder responder al pedido que le ha hecho un cliente, requiere de la compra de la materia prima, sin embargo, no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar esta compra, es por esto que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de materias primas como acr\u00edlico y acero para fabricar un gran pedido que le ha hecho un cliente.\n\nEduardo espera poder ubicarse en un mejor lugar y seguir desempe\u00f1ando su actividad.

For approximately 20 years he has been running his own metal shop, making acrylic and steel tiles.  Due to circumstance beyond his control he had to close his business and move to another city to find more employment opportunities.  Around six months ago he moved back home and wanted to start making his acrylic and steel tiles again, but did not have the tools, work space, or raw materials.  With much effort and hard work he was able to get ahead and acquire new machinery.  But he still has very little raw materials and works out of a rental space which does not offer all the services he needs to do his job.  Now that Eduardo has a larger order to fill he wants to take advantage of the situation to generate more income so he can move to a better location, where he can work more comfortably and have access to services.  To fill the order he needs to buy raw material, but does not have enough capital to do so.  So he is requesting a loan to buy acrylic and steel to be able to manufacture the order.\r\n\r\nEduardo hopes to be able to move to a more suitable location so he can continue his work.  His goal is to have a better lifestyle and be able to offer employment through his workshop to people who need a

She lives with her life partner who works making pastries such as donas, among others. She is a hardworking woman who has been raising domestic animals, such as chickens and pigs, for two years. She learned these tasks of her own account since she made the decision to begin caring for these animals in order to fatten them up and sell the meat in the shops of the municipality where she lives. This is her source of income and it allows her to take best advantage of her time.\r\n\r\nRoxana travels every 6 weeks to buy chickens to fatten up. The trip takes an hour by bus to arrive at the city. She has identified the business of raising chickens for meat as profitable, and this is why she requests a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy 50 chickens, and the rest of the money will be for making pastries (donas).\r\n\r\nWith the investment she hopes to buy more chickens than she has ever had, to have a greater source of income and improve her living conditions. Upon selling the chickens and in this way growing and extending herself in the market by selling the meat she is obtaining greater income for her home. Going forward she is thinking of expanding her chicken coop and being a powerful client in chicken sales in her region, and also providing a better life for her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":998805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 50 chickens, and the rest of the money will be for making pastries (donas).\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.78,"local_amount":120.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033184,"comment":null},{"amount":61.78,"local_amount":61.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":61.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645395,"comment":null},{"amount":61.92,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736382,"comment":null},{"amount":555.52,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":555.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561666,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T06:36:11Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388036,"name":"Beatriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatriz is from the village of Cabisera 15.

Katerine's goal is to grow her business even more and she is achieving this with good service as well as offering a hygenic, fresh palate-pleaser. Her clients referred her since her working capital is insufficient to accomodate the growing demand. This is why she is applying for a loan, her first with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will purchase products for the preparation of food as well as drinks to be able to respond to the unsatisfied demand of the area. She is taking advantage of the fact that Carnavales are approaching and sales usually increase in this season; it is for this reason that Katerine needs her business to be well-stocked.

hijo desde que era muy joven. Hernando poco a poco ha ido incrementando la cantidad de ganado que tiene en su tierra y gracias a esto ha podido generar m\u00e1s ingresos para el sostenimiento de su familia. Gracias a la buena calidad y el buen servicio que ofrece Hernando, sus clientes quedan muy satisfechos y por esto con el pasar del tiempo ha ido captando m\u00e1s clientes para su negocio. Debido a que ahora tiene m\u00e1s pedidos de sus clientes de los que puede satisfacer, busca poder incrementar la cantidad de ganado que cr\u00eda en su tierra y poder ofrecerles a sus clientes una buena venta. Sin embargo, como no cuenta con el capital suficiente para la compra de los nuevos ganados para la cr\u00eda, Hernando aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de ganado que le permita incrementar su capacidad productiva para poder responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.\n\nHernando espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten y le permita ofrecerle a su esposa una mejor calidad de vida. Adem\u00e1s, Hernando sue\u00f1a con poder tener una gran parcela donde pueda emplear a otras personas que est\u00e9n en situaciones muy vulnerables y nunca hayan encontrado oportunidades laborales.\n","en":"Hernando has been raising cattle since he was very young. His father also did this and taught his son from an early age. Little by little, Hernando has been increasing the quantity of cattle he has on his land and thanks to his effort, he has been able to generate more income to sustain his family. The good quality and service he offers has resulted in customer satisfaction and with the passage of time, he has won over additional customers for his business.\r\n\r\nSince Hernando now has more customer orders than he can satisfy, he is looking for ways to increase the quantity of cattle he raises on his land, and to offer his customers good sales. However, since he lacks sufficient capital to buy new cattle to raise, Hernando is seeking a loan that would offer the possibility of buying the cattle necessary to increase his productive capacity, allowing him to fill his customers' orders.\r\n\r\nHernando hopes in this way to increase his income and offer his wife a better quality of life. In addition, Hernando dreams of obtaining a larger parcel of land where he could employ other people who are in very vulnerable situations and have never found work

She worked for a long time in a beauty salon, after which she wanted to work for herself so she set up her own beauty salon.  Thanks to this activity, Miryam is able to collaborate with her husband in generating income for her household, where she lives with her two children, aged 12 and 16, in addition to her husband.\r\n\r\nShe set up her beauty salon with very little capital, and bit by bit she has been able to improve her work tools.

Deysi is 31 years old and lives with her husband and their three children, one of 9 years and the twins who are 2 years old. She has been buying and selling fish for twelve years. Her mother motivated her because she herself had always been engaged in this business.\r\n\r\nDeysi has to travel long distances to sell fish. Her goal is to use the loan to buy fish for two weeks since she is currently purchasing by the day because she does not have enough money to buy more.\r\n\r\nShe gets up at 4 a.m. and prepares breakfast for her children and husband and then leaves to buy fish. In order to reach the place where she buys them, she needs to ride three autobuses and the trip takes three hours. After buying the fish she goes to a city in the eastern part of the country to sell them. Then she returns home a bit tired, however her dream is to move her family forward.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy dried fish since Easter Week is approaching and she wants to buy wholesale to have a sufficient quantity during those days. By buying wholesale she acquires the fish cheaper and will be able to earn a greater profit. She will also travel less thereby saving time and money. Expanding her business and earning more profit will provide her family with a better life.\r\n\r\nDeysi\u2019s dream is to have a stall in the market since currently she is a street vender. She also wants to give her children an education so that their lives will be different.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1001699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase dried fish wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-03-01T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-31T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":22.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":22.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":22.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":24.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":24.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":27.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":47.89,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":47.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033190,"comment":null},{"amount":23.46,"local_amount":23.46,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":23.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491850,"comment":null},{"amount":24.64,"local_amount":24.64,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-22T07:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":24.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736386,"comment":null},{"amount":25.08,"local_amount":25.08,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561670,"comment":null},{"amount":25.87,"local_amount":25.87,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390781,"comment":null},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":26.39,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":26.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399906,"comment":null},{"amount":27.17,"local_amount":27.17,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":27.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382986,"comment":null},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":27.76,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":27.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990070,"comment":null},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":28.54,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970388,"comment":null},{"amount":43.2,"local_amount":43.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:08Z","rounded_local_amount":43.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T03:19:38Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388542,"name":"Rukhsana's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhsana is the mother of five children.

Fabian is a single parent who has 2 children in his care, aged 10 and 15 years old.  He has always wanted to provide them with a good education and a good quality of life.  Thanks to the good quality of Fabian's crops, his products are sought-after by his customers, and this has allowed him to generate good earnings for his family.  Because of some climate changes, his crops have become vulnerable and are not growing enough.  With the intention of getting his crops to grow so that he can deliver good quality products to his customers, Fabian is hoping to buy seeds and fertilizers with this loan.  This way he can make up for the crops that have been damaged by the climate changes.\r\n\r\nFabian hopes that in this way his crops will be of good quality, and he will be able to sell them to his customers for a good price.  This will allow him to generate income to support his children.  Fabian dreams of having a large farm and diversifying his products by growing vegetables and fruits.

Un d\u00eda se encontraba elaborando las arepas para el consumo de su familia cuando una vecina le pidi\u00f3 el favor de hacerle sus arepas y ella le pagaba por ellas. Su vecina qued\u00f3 muy satisfecha y le fue contando a sus dem\u00e1s vecinas y de esta forma su negocio fue creciendo hasta llegar a atender las tiendas y los autoservicios de su municipio. Yolanda trabaja sola, ya que su esposo tiene otro empleo para poder entre los dos generar ingresos suficientes para su hogar. En las ma\u00f1anas cocina el ma\u00edz, a medio d\u00eda lo muele y en horas de la tarde elabora y asa las arepas, ya en la ma\u00f1ana siguiente mientras el ma\u00edz del d\u00eda siguiente se cocina se dedica a realizar las entregas de las arepas a sus clientes. Gracias a la buena calidad de sus arepas, Yolanda tiene muy buenos pedidos, hasta el punto en que \u00faltimamente no ha tenido capacidad de atender a todos sus clientes. Es por esto que Yolanda busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de ma\u00edz en grandes cantidades para obtener un buen precio y a mejorar sus herramientas de trabajo como el horno asador y las parrillas de enfriamiento, que se han visto deterioradas con el pasar del tiempo por el trabajo.\n\nYolanda espera que su negocio le permita ofrecerles a su esposo y a su hija de 14 a\u00f1os una mejor calidad de vida y mejores oportunidades de progreso. Adem\u00e1s sue\u00f1a con comprar su casa propia y con ofrecerle a su hija la oportunidad de acceder a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria.\n","en":"Yolanda began her business from the time she was a newlywed. One day she was making arepas (traditional Colombian corn cakes) for her family to eat, when a neighbor asked her to please make arepas for her, and she would pay for them. Her neighbor was very satisfied, and started telling her other neighbors, and in this way her business grew little by little, until it came to serve stores and supermarkets in her municipality.  \r\n\r\nYolanda works alone, since her husband has another job, so that between the two of them they can generate sufficient income for their household. \r\n\r\nIn the mornings she cooks the corn, at mid-day she grinds it, and in the afternoon she forms the arepas and bakes them. The next morning while the corn for the following day is cooking, she delivers the arepas to her customers.  \r\n\r\nThanks to the good quality of her arepas, Yolanda has very good orders, to the point where lately she has not had the capacity to serve all her customers. This is why Yolanda is seeking a loan that offers her the chance to purchase corn in large quantities to get a better price; and to improve her equipment such as the roasting oven and cooling racks, that are in poor condition from long use.\r\n\r\nYolnda hopes that her business will allow her to offer her husband and her 14-year-old daughter a better quality of life, and a better chance to succeed. In addition, she dreams of buying her own house and offering her daughter the chance to get a university education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":998798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been selling little cheeses from butter and cream since she was 15 years old.  She now has 47 years of experience in this business activity.  She learned this trade when she was with her parents.  She says that this business activity is a family legacy.  She and her sisters do the same thing, and she says that she will always continue doing it as long as God gives her life.  This is the way she gets her family ahead.\r\n\r\nShe does not buy the supplies for her production because her family has always had cows.  What she does is process the milk she gets from the cows in order to make her sales at the market.  In order to get there Deysi needs to walk on foot for 35 minutes from her house to a turnoff where she boards a bus.  She rides for 15 minutes until she gets to another turnoff.  Finally, she walks on foot for ten minutes to get to the market.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Deysi is requesting is to buy two cows.
