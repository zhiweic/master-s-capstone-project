Previously, when he first came to our organization, he and his sons were involved in selling food products and clothing outside the city limits.  They had their own truck, which they used to deliver merchandise to districts.  With time and age, Rakhmat got tired of traveling to distant districts and decided to get involved in a business in his own trade.  Currently, he manufactures gates and fences at a leased factory for sale.  His products are also ordered for the districts and rural areas, and his sons sell them, using their truck.  Rakhmat has been obtaining loans from our organization for over two years and has used each loan to purchase raw materials.  He does not complain of life and earns his bread proudly, despite his age and his children's

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 20 years, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kyzylgul's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring and 1.4 hectares of land, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs.  The monthly profit from the business amounts to about 5,000 som (KGS).  Also, Kyzylgul grows berries and fruits in her garden, which brings in a small harvest primarily for her family's needs.

He is married and has four children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past two years, Jackson has been working hard to manage his grocery store, where he sells beans, maize and g-nuts. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jackson has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more produce like rice and posho, and will help Jackson to generate greater profits and help pay school fees. Jackson hopes that in the future he will be able to open up another store. \r\n\r\nJackson is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Jackson who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

Entre ellas tambi\u00e9n esta el trabajar con bueyes arando las tierras para realizar los cultivos, \u00e9l se levanta a las 4:00 a.m. para dar de comer a su bueyes y tomarse una taza de caf\u00e9, luego sale a  su trabajo que esta a media hora de su casa, llega a las 12: 00 p.m. a dar de comer a los bueyes.\n\nLos productos que necesita los compra en la ciudad, para llegar a ese lugar camina a pie unos quince minutos, luego aborda un autob\u00fas que recorre durante cuarenta y cinco minutos para llegar a la ciudad.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar un saco de maicillo, fertilizantes, herbicidas, pesticidas y  pago de mano de obra.  Con la inversi\u00f3n, \u00e9l dispondr\u00e1 de los insumos necesarios para realizar sus cultivos y obtener una buena cosecha que le permita ganar dinero. Entre sus planes est\u00e1n: el ahorrar de los ingresos obtenidos; para construir una casa de ladrillo, pues actualmente vive en una casa de bahareque y el que sus hijos terminen de estudiar una carrera universitaria. Pues a \u00e9l no se le presento esa oportunidad.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9, 38, lives with his life companion and their two children.  He\u2019s been working in agriculture for the last 20 years; he learned from some friends because his father was not in that occupation.  When he got married he saw that he needed to work to support his home which is why he went into agriculture.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to this activity, he\u2019s also worked in construction for the last 10 years, work he also learned with friends.  Jos\u00e9 states that need has led him to learn many things.  Among them is also tilling the land using oxen.  He rises at 4am to feed his oxen and drink a cup of coffee and then heads out to work which is half an hour away from home.  He returns at noon to feed the oxen.  He buys the products he needs in the city and to get there he walks for fifteen minutes to catch a bus that then takes 45 minutes to reach the city.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy a sack of sorghum, fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide and to pay labor costs.  With this investment he will have the necessary supplies on hand to plant and to obtain a good harvest that will allow him to earn money.  \r\n\r\nAmong his plans are: to save some of the income earned to build a brick house because he currently lives in a wattle and daub dwelling and that his children complete university careers because he never had the opportunity to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1174039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, farm supplies and pay labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-08-28T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-27T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517321,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T09:01:58Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:21:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":463410,"name":"Jose Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, solicita un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para poder continuar invirtiendo en el trabajo agr\u00edcola,en esta ocasi\u00f3n utilizar\u00e1 seis sacos de abono, tambi\u00e9n herbicidas y pesticidas, \u00e9l ha tenido un accidente realizando un juego de f\u00fatbol, se encontraba divirti\u00e9ndose con sus vecinos y amigos cuando se fractur\u00f3 su mano, la siembra que est\u00e1 realizando en realidad quienes la trabajar\u00e1n ser\u00e1n sus hermanos y hermanas, pues es una tarea fuerte que actualmente no puede revisar, el pr\u00e9stamo tambi\u00e9n le dar\u00e1 una parte para poder cubrir algunos cuidados con su mano.\n\nCon el pr\u00e9stamo anterior logr\u00f3 tener un efecto positivo, expandiendo la capacidad de la siembra, logrando sacar una mejor producci\u00f3n, su aspiraci\u00f3n es salir de esta situaci\u00f3n que actualmente atraviesa y continuar trabajando con los pr\u00e9stamos de kiva.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is requesting a new loan to continue investing in agricultural work.

She\u2019s been selling nacatamales [Nicaraguan style tamales], ice and soft-drinks for the last four years.  She\u2019s from the capital, Managua.  At the age of 25 she started selling chicha, a traditional beverage made from sweet corn.  Then she started selling food and after that nacatamales, soft-drinks and ice which is her current business.  On Saturdays and Sundays she sells hot-dogs and sandwiches.  The women in her family help her make the nacatamales.  She sells them at home and at a school where she sells food to the teachers.  Her husband helps her economically since he works selling clothes.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Estela would like to set up business somewhere other than in part of her home because she wants to expand the business, multiply sales and equip the space where she sells her product.

The loan will be used to buy more dresses and skirts in specific colors and cuts.  It will help Mercy to generate greater profits and increase the range of her inventory to attract customers. \r\n\r\nMercy hopes that in the future she will be able to open another boutique. \r\n\r\nMercy is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Mercy who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but whose businesses have grown too large for

He began his business in Feb. 2008. Jeffrey describes NuVision as an investment company because, within his business, he takes under-performing apartment complexes and makes them profitable again.  \r\n\r\nJeffrey\u2019s job is to find what the problems are and fix them. He said the majority of the time, a major problem is that a complex owner is new and does not fully understand how to run a business, therefore, tenants may take advantage of the situation. However, Jeffrey is experienced in his field as he previously worked with foreclosed homes.  Jeffrey learned how to successfully make under-performing establishments into profitable places through a combination of self study, a mentor and some trial and error.\r\n\r\nThe father of three decided to become an entrepreneur to have more time for his family and ability to create his own schedule. Before working with his management company, he worked with an aircraft company in Los Angeles along with an apartment builder who Jeffrey began networking with to learn how the business works. Jeffrey also had a friend who was an established real estate broker and advised him throughout the beginning of his new business.\r\n\r\nCurrently Jeffrey works alone and has not been able to successfully bid on an establishment so he works with partners who are in charge of placing the cash down payment to secure a bid. When the bid is confirmed, the partner will then receive a percentage of Jeffrey\u2019s profits. Their responsibility is providing the funds. Thereafter, Jeffrey reviews the building, fixes any problems that need to be fixed and offers financial management. \u201cOur partnerships are just to secure a bid. They don\u2019t have to do anything else,\u201d he said. With the help of his partners, Jeffrey manages four buildings. \r\n\r\nThe website Jeffrey is in the process of building will list potential properties and make it easier to obtain partners.

After finding out about Accion Texas Inc. through meeting his loan officer at a business resource meeting, Raul decided to apply for a loan. Upon the approval of a loan from Accion, Raul said he plans to use the funds to purchase materials and equipment, and offer better services for his customers. Without the loan, Raul would have to pay 100 percent upfront for the equipment.  \r\n\r\nJust as his father worked all week, Raul continues to keep the shop open Monday through Saturday and to provide for his five children.

of eight children.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in fattening up and breeding livestock since 1979.  The business, started practically from zero, today, thanks to Jamalbubu's persistence and hard work, contains four cattle, twenty small livestock and two horses, and yields about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sale of milk products.  The earnings from the business allowed her to provide education for her children, who set up their lives and now live separately.  In order to further develop her business, Jamalbubu requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings into a continued business growth and wants to help her youngest son to build a house this

She works as a teacher at a local school and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, has been involved in fattening up and breeding livestock since 2011.  Today Asiya's business contains one dairy cow with offspring, which allows her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sale of milk products.  In order to further develop her business, Asiya requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.

In the photo she is wearing a black \"soutra\" (muslim clothing). She is married and the mother of 5 children from ages 15 to 28. One of Zoenabo's children attends school; she has 5 dependents. \r\n\r\nZoenabo has been selling sandwiches and candy for 22 years. She now sells pastries and weaves traditional fabrics because she used to sell to students who are currently on vacation. She stocks up at the Wend Konta bakery and now also at the market in Pissy for pastries. Her customers are students, since she sells in schools, and now also her neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan went smoothly, so Zoenabo is happy and thanks God for this.

Today he distributes his product to twelve salespeople who have ice cream carts in the city. The basic supplies and materials Wilson buys on credit from an ice cream producer. He works from 9am until noon and then from 2pm until 6pm or until he finishes his work. He works from Monday to Sunday. His goal is to increase the carts he supplies with delicious ice cream to more than fifty in the city.  In the future he would like his own home. Each day he would like to improve the welfare of his family, which includes his wife and two daughters, ages four and five. This is his first loan with KIVA, through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With this loan he will buy ice cream and carts in order to begin to reach his goals. This investment will be successful, as he knows the market since he has been involved with it for six years. He would like to continue growing his business for a long time so that it will eventually become a great company.
