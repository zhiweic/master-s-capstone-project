is 53 years old and married to her husband, with 2 beautiful children.

A few months earlier, Luz stopped teaching at her private school due to the massive competition of daycare schools, where many of her students transferred to public schools. After deciding to shut down her private school, she decided to apply to a public school in front of their house as a Grade 2 teacher. Hoping to be accepted in the school next year, she is now relying on her income through her ready-to-wear products. With this business running over almost 28 years, she is very successful in this style. Luz is a member of Paglaum since 2008 and having loans to expand her business.

Elmira has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Elmira works with livestock breeding, after having started 7 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow, a calf and a horse. Elmira's husband is a shepherd, herding cattle for the local population for a fee. Their monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Elmira turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to increase the number of livestock.

Sustaining a family with a meager source of income is undeniably difficult for everyone, but it is harder for Lhingneichong, whose work site is about 5 kms away from the village. She walks at the break of the dawn to collect charcoal and comes back the same 5 kms route to the village and boards a mini truck with the charcoal at the top of the mini truck to the town market to sell it. She is the featured borrower member for Lily Lom and she is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nThe group comprises five hardworking women who all reside in a village that is about 15 kms far from the town. The town is 62 kms from the capital town of Imphal. The group members usually contribute equal shares and take land from the village chief on rent for a period of one year so that they can cut down firewood and burn it for charcoal. When the charcoal is ready to be sold, she walks everyday at the break of the dawn to collect the charcoal from the burial sites and carries the charcoal sack on her back and walks back to the village. Only once or twice do vehicles ply that route. If one gets lucky, then one gets a ride or else walking is the only option. From the village, she travels to the town market with the charcoal and sells it.\r\n\t\r\nWith the KIva loan, she will contribute a share for taking the land on rent and start burning charcoal. She is sure to earn a good amount of money since charcoal is in great demand during winter season and the price also is high unlike in off seasons. She says she will also be able to pay new admissions for the children without worrying where to get the money as she could sell her charcoal like hot cakes in this season. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to purchase a used mini truck so that it can be used as a carrier for charcoal and also as a passenger carrier. She thanked Kiva and hopes it will continue cooperation with WSDS and make their lives happy ones.  She is also glad for the support and believes that this may bring a success in life. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in charcoal business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1502256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase a portion of land on rent, cut woods and burn charcoal for selling to support the family and kids education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-28T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-26T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damneihkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tainu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Tinkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T18:46:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":651544,"name":"Luis Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis est\u00e1 agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a su ayuda el podr\u00e1 comprar enseres para su vivienda, como ollas, platos, entre otros, y de esta manera poder mejorar su calidad de vida, as\u00ed el seguir\u00e1 trabajando como vendedor en el grifo donde labora y seguir\u00e1 ahorrando para hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Comprar un terreno\u201d.\n","en":"Luis is grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their help he will be able to buy household items for his home, such as pots, plates and other articles, and in this way improve his quality of life.
