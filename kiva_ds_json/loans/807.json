\u201cTeresita Tlacoachis\u201d because that's the name of its representative's youngest daughter, and also, in honor of their community. This history concerns Sebastiana who is a member of the group. She is 49 years of age, married to Tobias, with whom she has 6 children, of whom 4 are studying; 2 are in 2nd and 3rd year of preparatory school, 1 more in the 1st year of secondary, and the youngest in 6th year of primary. Her 2 eldest are married. Sebastiana has made and sold snacks for the last 15 years. \r\n\r\nSabastiana says that she decided to begin this activity because she wanted to find a means of helping her husband meet household expenses, and to help her children with their studies, because it's a very good source of income, offering good earnings. The loan will be used to purchase additional supplies, such as chiles, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, lettuce, cheese, oil, salt, corn, firewood, meat, etc., to continue her sales.\r\n\r\nThe goal of \u201cSebas\u201d (as she's best known in her community) is to increase her business considerably, and to start a small restaurant, to be better able to help her children with their studies, so they might have good professional careers.\r\n\r\nSebas wishes to thank Kiva lenders for the confidence they offer her and her group, since with this help, they will be able to advance their businesses and, most importantly, their families.\r\n\r\nThe persons who make up the \u201cTeresita Tlacoachis\u201d group and their activities are as follows: Maribel \u2013 embroiderer; Sebastiana \u2013 snack sales; Anabel \u2013 embroiderer; Maximino \u2013 taco sales; and Benita \u2013 embroiderer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5925,"image":{"id":1018935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies such as chiles, tomatos, onions, potatoes, lettuce, cheese,oil, salt, corn, fire wood,meat, etc., to prepare meals to sell.

following description is about Se\u00f1orita Moncerrat as she is the group representative. She is 19 years old, single, and has been selling shoes from a catalog for close to three months. Monce decided to start this line of work because she wanted to find a way to improve her standard of living and help her parents with household expenses. She will use the loan to buy catalogs, shoes, runners, sandals etc. so she can better stock her business.\r\n\r\nMonce\u2019s greatest wish is to begin saving money so she can build her own premises for a shoe store, generate more sales, and have more stock of a greater variety. She would then earn more money and be able to continue supporting her parents.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the assistance that this loan will provide. As a result her business will improve greatly, and her life and that of her family will change too.\r\n\r\nThe group members have a variety of businesses: \r\nTeresita--butcher\r\nIgnacia--fruit

He gets his supplies from villages in the surroundings of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, he foresees turning an average monthly profit of XOF 125'00 (ca US$ 250), to be used to bolster his working capital, help with the family's expenses, and pay the interests of his loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1029401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 60 chickens, 5 guineafowl, 10 turkeys, 8 ducks, 4 geese, medication, and food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-25T08:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":103014.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251936,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103014.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502794,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":103014.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102915,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T00:13:41Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398462,"name":"Davlatbi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0414\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0431\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0439 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438.

cocina, es por eso que conf\u00eda en que con el tiempo podr\u00e1 brindar muchos m\u00e1s platos a m\u00e1s clientes. Tambi\u00e9n ha demostrado ser fan\u00e1tica de la cosmetolog\u00eda, porque aunque no haya asistido a clases ella ha aprendido a hacer peinados, cortar el cabello, pintarlo, entre otras cosas. Ella brinda este tipo de servicio en algunas ocasiones a personas que viven por su zona. Al ser este su gran sue\u00f1o ella ha decidi\u00f3 abrirse nuevos caminos como cosmet\u00f3loga, con la ayuda de los prestatarios Kiva ella podr\u00e1 comprarse un espejo grandes y un mueble para guardar todos sus peines, ganchos, ruleros, etc. a su vez tambi\u00e9n quiere invertir en la compra de algunos abarrotes, arroz y az\u00facar y as\u00ed incrementar sus ganancias.\n\nSu gran sue\u00f1o es poder comprar algunos equipos de peluquer\u00eda y as\u00ed convertirse en una cosmet\u00f3loga reconocida en la ciudad de Ica, lugar donde actualmente vive.\n","en":"Matilde is a 57-year-old woman who very much enjoys cooking, especially \"Adobo de Chancho.\" Matilde has always wanted to excel in life and come out ahead through her own efforts, and this is why, when she left school and couldn't find any opportunity to become a cosmetician, she decided to look for another way to get ahead.\r\n\r\nCurrently Matilde works selling food in a hotel. She serves 7 permanent customers and among them they have been commenting about how well she cooks. This is why she trusts that with time she'll be able to provide more dishes to more customers. Also she has shown that she crazy about cosmetology because even though she hasn't taken any classes she has learned to do hairstyles, cut hair, dye, among other things. She offers this type of service on some occasions to people who live in her area. Since this is her great dream she decided to open up new paths for herself such as cosmetology. With the help of Kiva lenders she will be able to buy a big mirror and a piece of furniture to keep all her combs, clips, rollers, etc at the same time she wants to invest in the purchase of some groceries, rice and sugar and in this way increase her profits.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is to be able to buy some beauty salon equipment and in this way become a cosmetician recognized in the city of Ica, the place where she currently lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1018658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSharon hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

Single, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMariam operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and prepare food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMariam dreams to grow her business in the future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is married to Elmer, a company driver, and a mother of seven children. By the grace of God, Eleonor has managed to support their daily expenses. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college, a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Eleonor. She herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEleonor operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of gas, money, and time to cook food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEleonor dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have a restaurant someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":991285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for raw ingredients and products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings, which are needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":576.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146184,"comment":null},{"amount":26.68,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1153.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275422,"comment":null},{"amount":159.99,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6920,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T23:38:35Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400445,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip is 27 years old and married with one child.

He has a sewing shop where he makes a variety of garments for all tastes and preferences. He has been doing this for five years, so he has a great deal of experience and is well-known. This business is his main source of income and has allowed him to provide his family's daily bread. His main desire is for his family to have life opportunities different from those he has had. For this reason, he works hard to get his beloved family ahead. He is hard-working, dedicated, and, above all, responsible. This has allowed him to gain the confidence of his neighbours, who like his business more every day. All of this has led him to the decision to request this loan from INTEGRAL to invest in his sewing workshop through the purchase of the necessary basic material (fabric, buttons, elastic, ribbon, thread, etc). This will allow him to serve a higher demand, thus improving his sales levels. This will then allow him to reach his dream of providing his family with a better quality of life.

She is a widow. She manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCrisanta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 42,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCrisanta dreams of growing her business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1021753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-09T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-08T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crisanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":14266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998053,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606593,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":8916.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095450,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":7133.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359070,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7133.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294302946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T03:58:34Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:11:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400471,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a married woman.

This pushes her to be attentive to the ebb and flow of her business; that is to say, she always tries to be one step ahead of the competition so her business can come out on top in the area where she lives. This has also moved her to make the decision to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in a variety of products for her shop. She will buy rice, beans, milk, coffee, oil, candy, sugar, paper, etc., so her customers will always find what they\u2019re looking for and find satisfaction in her customer service. That way, she hopes to sell more products and improve her income in order to give her family a better quality of life, especially for her children who demand more every day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1019305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy rice,

is Vicky.  She is 43 years old and a resident of Manila, in the Philippines.  Her husband Antonio is a sales manager, and a father to her two children. She together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating a business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nVicky maintains a direct selling business.  She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer, and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 4000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12, 000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy more orders for her customers.  She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nVicky hopes to be more successful with her business and dreams to be able to give her children a good future through all her hard work.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

She makes a living running a general store and making tortillas out of her home. She has a large customer base because she is known for being a charismatic, hard-working, dedicated and responsible woman. Many people give her good references, so over time her work has earned the confidence of her neighbors. Despite her advanced age she doesn't tire from her work, since for her it's her biggest joy. Her business is very accessible and highly frequented. Marta is very enterprising, so she is always looking for ways to grow her business. Her goal is to be able to meet the demands of a larger market, which is why she has decided to invest in her business so she can increase her sales and profits to improve her quality of life. All of this has brought her to request a loan from Kiva partner Integral, because she doesn't have sufficient funds to invest on her own. She will invest the loan in the purchase of necessary products like corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergent, drinks and other items, so she can make her delicious tortillas and sell the different items in her store. She is confident that with her work and God's help she will be able to achieve her dream of giving her family a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1019308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase corn, beans, oil, coffee, milk, rice, snacks, paper, detergents, drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966381,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T14:02:33Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400514,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica is 49 years old and married with 2 children.

Despite competition, he tries to get out as early as possible to move a good number of passengers to their various destinations and thus earn a larger amount of income to cover his expenses and personal needs.\r\n\r\nThe 2000 new sol loan he\u2019s asked Edpyme Alternativa for will be to buy a new canopy, renovate the seats and the overall maintenance of his mototaxi that is needed after a certain period of time, to continue providing good customer service and to improve his standard of living. Juan is a hardworking man who wants to get ahead with his family through his own efforts.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1019768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"buy a new canopy, renovate the seats and the overall maintenance of his mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":139.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":142.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":162.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":175.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":179.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":184.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":192.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":196.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.92,"local_amount":282.45,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":283.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621381,"comment":null},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":149.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":149.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332750,"comment":null},{"amount":116.61,"local_amount":310.95,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":312.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316937,"comment":null},{"amount":60.45,"local_amount":161.2,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373774,"comment":null},{"amount":128.91,"local_amount":343.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":345.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368624,"comment":null},{"amount":67.27,"local_amount":179.4,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":180.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977689,"comment":null},{"amount":69.06,"local_amount":184.15,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506595,"comment":null},{"amount":72.33,"local_amount":192.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506596,"comment":null},{"amount":73.56,"local_amount":196.15,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":196.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-01T16:32:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400519,"name":"Kalamera Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, is very pleased to present to you members of the \u201cKalamera\u201d group.

This area is noted for farming, livestock and handicrafts. Rosa has been raising and selling sheep and pigs for some years. Her animal pens are located outside her home and are suitable and spacious. She gives her animals balanced feed and natural pastures so they reach an optimum level of development, and she then sells them in the different markets in her area, making good profits that enable her to cover her family's daily expenses. Rosa also owns a hectare of land that her father left as an inheritance. She grows lemons which, once harvested, she sells in the markets in her area. Rosa has requested a loan from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa to buy balanced feed and fertilizers to improve her land and crops. She will use the income she makes to repay her loan and improve her family's quality of life. Rosa is a hard-working person and very responsible.

","en":"Nurinarda is 66 years old and her business is making handicrafts such as backpacks and bags.  She carries out this work every day.  On weekends, she also prepares special food.  She has a 22-year-old son who is studying and it is for him that she is driven to work hard, so that she can make income and improve his well-being.  Nurinarda's daily life consists of caring for children in a 'hogar substituto' (center for vulnerable children) in her home.  This is supported by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, an organization that protects children in Colombia.  This makes her some additional income.  In the afternoons, she makes her handicrafts which also earns her income.  She learned this work by family tradition in her home town of San Jacinto and started working in her own business doing this one year ago. \r\n\r\nOn weekends, Nurinarda prepares and sells empanadas, 'pan prensado' (a type of sandwich), desserts and other treats.  She is also well known for this by her neighbors.  Nurinarda's goal is to position herself in her businesses.  She permanently needs working capital to invest so that her number of customers will continue to increase every day.   This is why she is taking out a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).

is married. She has three children aged between 4 and 11. All go to school. She has been a rice farmer for nine years. She would like to get this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and pay for support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, she plans to expand the area she has been using to get more output. In the picture you see Joe with some of her fellow rice growers sitting behind her.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
