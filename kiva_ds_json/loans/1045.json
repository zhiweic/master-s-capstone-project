Together they have collaborated on two previous loans from Friendship Bridge and have bolstered their small businesses. This group represents a variety of industries: a knitting business, a local clothing store, a convenience store, and a local sewing business. With their previous loans, one member was able to double her sewing capacity by purchasing two more sewing machines and by hiring another employee. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan Do\u00f1a Teresa (in the back row, second from the right), will be able to purchase necessary yarn and needles for her hand-knit sweater business. Having learned to knit as a child, Dona Teresa now has a life-time of experience and is able to help support her seven children. With school fees and the pressures of daily life in Guatemala, Teresa says that she has finally been able to \u201ccatch her breath\u201d after receiving her first two loans. She feels that \u201cthere is a peace that comes from knowing where your money is going to come from.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlong with Teresa, Las Florecitas de San Cristobal are excited to support their families, help pay for their children\u2019s education, and even help one member finish building her house.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nJoy hopes her variety store will go a long way and dreams to give her child a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

is Crisencio, 34, resident of Silang, Cavite Philippines. He is married to Marilou, is self employed and father to their children. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCrisencio oversees the operations of their Jeepney (* see footnote) transportation business. He has been in this business for twelve years now. They have one Jeep that carries up to sixteen passengers to their destinations within the community. He earns from the boundary (daily quota) their driver achieves everyday. Their regular passengers and customers are from the local community. He earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in boundary every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to maintain his Jeepney unit. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nCrosencio dreams of having more jeepneys and hopes to have a good life. He meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his life and business every week and there he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n*-Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating.

She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy different products like bed sheets, curtains and other items. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and educational expenses of her children.

The profit from the business helps Syrga to cover her daily family expenses. With the goal to further grow her business Syrga has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle for feeding.

The loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo will help him buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nJackson says what is most enjoyable about farming is, \"feeding cows!\" His biggest challenges are \"diseases and expensive dairy feed.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Maua.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, he replied: \"Because it gives loans to farmers to boost their production and improve their livelihoods.\" When asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, Jackson replied, \"the importance of directing funds to the intended projects.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expenses are his children's school fees. When asked how this loan will benefit his family, Jackson replied, \"My children will get a proper education and food.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jackson owns a cow and poultry but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

There he has a store where he sells snack foods and soft drinks, so he is able to take advantage of the flow of customers who make purchases each day.  He relies on this income.  Leonardo\u2019s business experience started three years ago.  He was recommended by workers at a major company that was in need of everyday household products.  However, it was not easy to transport products from the market plaza.  At that moment, Leonardo was offered a location where he could set up his shop.  Now he is well-known in his neighborhood and in the surrounding areas.  His customers know that he keeps his store organized.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeonardo begins his work at 5 A.M. and continues until 5 P.M.  His sales are conducted with cash or through a payment system in which he offers a company discount based on the worker\u2019s salary.  The customer must agree to the arrangement.  Leonardo\u2019s goal is to update his inventory so that he will have a diversified assortment of products by which he can always influence his customers.  For this reason, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Leonardo will use the money to buy rice, sugar, oil, and general household products.

The income is hardly enough to cover even food and everyday expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nEkaterina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith a family-owned car, Ekaterina will purchase kitchen utensils and different kinds of household items in Turkey for wholesale prices and resell them in her town and nearby villages for a profit. It will be hard work for Ekaterina, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase her stock and sales volume.

In this way, she will be able to earn higher income and provide for a better living. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1278013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy additional wood for making charcoal ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Casambalangan, Sta.

sells rice, salt and cooking oil within the public market of Santiago. She is separated and has six children. She has custody of all her children. Being the single bread-winner of a family is hard, but Joselyn's guiding principle is willingness and hard work in order to for her to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nAccording to Joselyn, she started her rice retailing business with a capital of 50,000 PHP. She is really glad because her sacrifice bore good results. Now, as her children grow, her expenses also increase.

His main goal is to have a stable business so he can help his other siblings finish their studies and have improved living conditions.\r\n\r\nGeorge raises hogs and manages a 7,000 square meter fishpond and two hectares of corn farm. It's been nine years since he began to cultivate his farmland and help his parents raise their hogs. George struggles for funds due to the high cost of hog feed and aqua feed. He has therefore requested a loan of PHP 25,000 because he knows that it would really be of great impact in making his businesses more profitable and productive because he could ensure them with proper care.

When he sells his cleaning products, he sells them bulk bottles of what the housewives or housekeepers ask for and the quantities that they want. He has been in this business for 15 years. He says that he started because his mother-in-law sold cleaning products and, since he decided to live with \u00c1ngeles, he decided to sell these products. He says that it is going very well for him and he already has secure customers. Rogelio comments \u201cI always try to get the best products from my suppliers to always keep my customers satisfied with the products.\u201d He says that he has always had competition, and in fact, one of his bad experiences was when a male storeowner complained because he did not want him to sell on that street any longer since it seemed that the storeowner was not making the same sales anymore and asked him to no longer sell on that street. Rogelio never went back to sell on that street. However, people sought him out on another street to buy the products from him. Rogelio is very happy with Vision Fund and Kiva for the loan provided, since thanks to this, he will be able to obtain more products and his profits will increase, which will help him meet the costs of education for his daughters, since the most important thing for Rogelio is that his daughters finish professional degrees.

The are very responsible people who are in their third cycle within the institution. \r\n\r\nThey chose their group name themselves as it signifies a new start for them, they were working with a different microfinance institution previously, which was why they were encouraged to work with VisionFound and KIVA. \r\n\r\nNoelia, 33, is a group member and has been married to Delfino since she was 18. Together they have five children, all of whom are currently in education.\r\n\r\nNoelia has been baking bread for a living since she was 18, as her husband Delfino is also employed in this trade. It seems that the business was originally started by Delfino's father.\r\n\r\nThey are requesting this loan to buy ingredients for making bread like flour, eggs and milk, etc. The four members claim that, in general, the greatest difficulty that they face is when they go to markets to sell their goods and find that there is no place for them or that it is too expensive. Noelia comments \"I really enjoy making bread, as it is a family tradition and we do not want to lose the breads that we make. Ours are orange, walnut and vanilla, although we also make cream gorditas.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties that Noelia faces, her goal is to provide her children with a better future, so that they can finish their education, and to make some repairs to their home.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are Aurelio, Joel and Delfino who are also requesting loans from the institution to buy ingredients for making bread.

She told us that when she was studying, there was only an elementary school in her community and in order to continue studying she would have had to go to another town and it would have been expensive. Since she was young she was taught how to work hard; the boys were taught how to farm and the girls were taught how to work in the home. Now times have changed and she and her husband both work to give to their children more opportunity to study. \r\n\r\nA little over three years ago Gabriela started to sell corn, tortillas and tortilla dough with the idea of earning income to help her husband with the household expenses. With the passing of time she has made good customers and her profits have increased which has allowed her to give her children a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe runs her business out of her home and because she is well known, her customers are happy to spend their money with her. This loan she will use to buy corn and firewood to be able to continue with her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to open a new business, perhaps selling groceries or clothing.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank group \"Dania\" is thankful for the support that has been given to them through loans for their businesses, which also help them give their families a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\nGregoria who sells drinks\r\nMirna who sells fruits and vegetables\r\nAraceli who sells household items  \r\nLiliana sells cheese\r\nYanet sells tortillas \r\nValentina sells drinks and candies\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1286214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy corn and firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Limas, Tezonapa; Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-01-30T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-01T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":398.44,"local_amount":5062.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5067.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284978,"comment":null},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":6756.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199274,"comment":null},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6756.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596068,"comment":null},{"amount":664.06,"local_amount":8437.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8445.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-31T00:10:08Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":522488,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene, 36 years old, is married and they were blessed with three children.

ten\u00eda que descansar varios periodos de tiempo, fue como decidi\u00f3 emprender su rosticer\u00eda, solo que al inicio se le dificulto mucho ya que nadie le ofrec\u00eda apoyo para iniciar su rosticer\u00eda, pr\u00e1cticamente don Andr\u00e9s no ten\u00eda conocimiento de nada ni siquiera para preparar el pollo platica que sus pollos al principio les faltaba cocinar (Crudos),se le quemaba para poder aprender tuvieron que pasar tres meses, entre otras situaciones que tuvo que vivir quiz\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n influ\u00eda en la maquina porque inicio con una maquina usada, esta vez Don

que fue fueron sus dos accidentes el primero fue debido a la carga de trabajo como consecuencia se quedo dormido en el volante porque se encontraba conduciendo de noche  las consecuencias no afectaron mucho al negocio, tampoco a su familia sin embargo si hubo consecuencias en su salud y gasto mucho en medicamentos, en este accidente perdi\u00f3 la camioneta que apenas hab\u00eda comprado y tuvo que recurrir  a una camioneta mas viejita con la que inicio claro que a esta le cab\u00edan menos pollos Don Andr\u00e9s acostumbra traer el pollo en otro municipio que queda como una hora de camino. En su otro accidente su hubo grandes p\u00e9rdidas porque en este si tuvo que cerrar una poller\u00eda que ten\u00eda en otro municipio, en este \u00faltimo accidente aunque no tuvo la culpa tuvo que pagar todo lo ocasionado las p\u00e9rdidas materiales del otro carro. Sin embargo a pesar de todo esto Don Andr\u00e9s tiene la meta de que sus hijos tengan que un patrimonio que les permita vivir planamente, pero tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda que sus negocios le den lo suficiente para pode asegurar su vejez no le gustar\u00eda vivir con preocupaciones econ\u00f3micas.\n\n","en":"Andr\u00e9s is a very hardworking and responsible man and this is the first time that he will be working with the institution. He tells us that he is 43 and has been married to Mar\u00eda del Carmen for several years, together they have 5 children and 3 of them are dependent on them and still in education.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s only obtained a secondary school education and has had a rotisserie for four years. He says he started his business because he used to be a carpenter and often found himself without work for periods of time. He decided to start his business, which was difficult to begin with as no-one offered him any support. Andr\u00e9s had practically no knowledge of how to run his business, not even how to prepare the chickens. He tells us that in the beginning his chickens were raw and needed cooking, he often burned them and it took three months for him to learn. Along with the some of other experiences he has had, this may have been partly caused by the machine, as he began his business with a second-hand machine. \r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is requesting the loan to buy another machine as he is thinking about opening another rotisserie in another town. He tells us that the difficulties he has faced include his two accidents, the first of which happened because of his workload as he fell asleep at the wheel whilst driving at night, although the consequences have not affected his business nor his family, although his health has been affected and he has to spend a lot on medicines. In the accident he lost the van that he had only just bought and had to go back to an older van, which obviously could not hold as many chickens.\r\n\r\nAndr\u00e9s is used to taking the chicken to another town and spends around an hour en route.

They live in a housing development that is supported by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which supports the construction of sustainable communities. Candelaria was given a place to live in this community by the Colombian government because she was displaced from the home she was living in. Before she was given her home she had many needs, so when she became a beneficiary of this project, she didn't hesitate to sell all of her household furnishings and with the profits opened a small store with basic food necessities for a family. Little by little her small store has turned into an income generator, which she is now able to support her family with. Her goal is to be able to provide her children with a good education so that they will have a better future. This is why she works persistently to achieve her goal.     \r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which is a Kiva loan.

En sus ratos libres le gusta disfrutar con sus hijos, y tener tiempo de calidad con ellos, lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3mico no pudo cursar una carrera universitaria pero le hubiera gustado mucho estudiar laboratorio cl\u00ednico.\nGracias a su espiritud de  emprendimiento y sus ganas de salir adelante es que tiene por actividad econ\u00f3mica un cafet\u00edn, desde hace 8 anos que se dedica a dicha actividad, y lo tiene ubicado en uno de los hospitales infantiles  de la regi\u00f3n. Actividad que la desempe\u00f1a con mucho gusto ya que ha sido su forma de vida y la de sus hijos.

She's married and has two underage children aged 6 and 1. She comes from Managua, which is located in the central area of that region. In her free time, she enjoys playing with her children and spending quality time with them. Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources she wasn't able to go to college, but she would have liked to have studied to become a clinical lab technician.\r\nThanks to her enterprising spirit and her drive to get ahead, she owns a business which is a grocery store. She has been in this line of work for the past 8 years and the store is located in one of the local children's hospitals. She greatly enjoys running this business, since it has been a means of livelihood for her and her children. The purpose of the loan is to get working capital and stock up her business by purchasing foodstuffs such as bread, coffee, sugar, fresh fruit juices, soft drinks, pastries, juices, matches, and cookies. That way she'll increase her profits in a not-so-distant future. Darling Dinora gives thanks for the help provided by Kiva lenders to people of scarce financial resources in poor countries like Nicaragua so that they can have a decent line of

She tells us that she always wanted to have a grocery shop in her home to be able to help with the household expenses. Five months ago, with the help of her husband, she was able to set up a little shop where she sells various groceries, sweets and drinks. Margarita opens her business early every day to welcome her neighbours. Her favourite thing about her business is that her children are learning to work as they occasionally help in the store.\r\n\r\nA loan from Vision Fund will help her to restock her business by buying beans, oil, rice, soup, sugar, toilet paper, tin foil, tooth paste, shampoo, biscuits and drinks. She hopes that with this investment her business can continue growing and offering a better service to her customers and in the future she will be able to give her children the opportunity to continue with their studies.\r\n\r\nNB. the woman in the background wearing the blouse and black trousers is not a group member, but she wanted to be in the

independientemente, cuenta que le ha ido muy bien en sus ventas siempre trata lo mejor posible a su clientas, platica que lo mas chistoso de su trabajo es venderle ropa intima a los cabaleros ya que ellos es mas dificil de tenerlos contentos porque a unos no les gusta la tela, los colores, los estilos, tipos y a otros pues si es muy dificil convencer a los caballeros que le compren por eso casi no venden ropa intima para caballero, Maura comento \"Me gusta mucho mi actividad porque gracias a la venta de ropa intima he podido sacar adelante a mis hijos que se encuentran estudiando ya que para mi ellos son mi pilares para seguir adelante, aunque luego hay clientes que se tardan en pagar pero siempre pagan tarde pero seguro\" Do\u00f1a Maura anteriormente solo vendia por catalogo pero penso que obtendria mas gannacias si pudiera vender varios tipos de ropa y atraer mas clientas situacion que le ha favorecido muy bien todas las tardes Do\u00f1a Maura recorre las calles de su comunidad y de otras comunidades para ofrecer sus prendas, una de las metas de Do\u00f1a Maura es que sus hijos puedan realizarse profesionalmente para que ellos puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida.

It is a very friendly group that knows how to solve problems easily between themselves. They have a strong friendship which makes them different from other groups. They chose the name for the group themselves because they liked it; they\u2019re not sure if the fact that one of the members is called Jazmin influenced them or if it was something else. \r\n\r\nMaura is a member of the group and is 38 years old. She is the single mother of three children who are all in school. Maura sells underwear and is requesting a loan so that she can buy items such as bras, panties, tights, among other items. She has been running her business for five years and started the business  because she was helping a  friend with her underwear business and saw that it made money. That\u2019s why she decided to set up a business of her own. She has made good sales and she always tries to treat her customers well. She says that the funniest thing about her job is selling underwear to men because they are very difficult to please. They either don\u2019t like the material, the color, or the styles, and it\u2019s very difficult to convince them to buy things, and that\u2019s why she hardly ever sells to men. Maura says, \"I like my job a lot because thanks to selling underwear, I have been able to provide for my children who are in school and for me they are my motivation to keep going. Some customers take a while to pay me but they always pay in the end.\" Maura used to sell by catalog but realized that she could make more money selling a variety of clothing to attract more customers, which has worked well for her. \r\n\r\nEvery afternoon Maura passes through the streets of her community and other communities selling clothing. One of Maura\u2019s goals is for her children to be able to achieve their professional dreams so that they have a better quality of life. The other members of the group are Florentina, who will buy corn to make tortillas, Margarita who will invest in her dressmaking workshop, Maribel, Beatriz,  and Miran will invest in clothes to sell, Alicia will buy materials to improve her house, Lizbeth C, Jazmin, Laura and Antonia will buy chickens and turkeys to raise and sell, Elena, Lizbeth S. and Rosalia will invest in sheep to raise and sell, finally Leticia will buy fabric to make curtains to sell.\r\nThey are all very grateful to Vision Found and Kiva for the loan which will be a great help for their businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6300,"image":{"id":1283145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
