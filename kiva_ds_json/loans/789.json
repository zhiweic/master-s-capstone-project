She knows that her job is exhausting but she always is ready to continue selling.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva lenders she will be able to buy a refrigerator, which will help her make her gelatins, because she constantly asks her neighbor to put them in hers, a service for which her neighbor charges.  This is why she prefers to begin paying for something of her own, and have the refrigerator available whenever she needs it.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to open a small business where she can sell school supplies because the school year is approaching.  She also wants to continue selling her gelatin and for her children to grow up strong and

When she is finished, she starts selling lubricants to her waiting customers.  Her customers are mainly motorcycle taxi drivers or the vehicles' owners themselves.  Her business premises are located in her home and she has worked there for two years with the help of her son who carries out oil changes.  Berta really enjoys her work as it allows her to have time free to spend on other activities.  Owing to her good customer service, she has managed to gain a number of customers.

This area is known for its rich, pre-colonial culture and its handicrafts which are well known both at home and abroad.  It is home to the famous Panama hat.\r\n\r\nThis group decided to get together three loan cycles ago and form a loan group.  It has been very useful to them as they have used their loans to improve their small businesses and their lives in general.  The members are engaged in different business activities including animal raising, general commerce and other activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Rosa who is 51 years old and married.  She had nine children from her marriage but two of them died.  Her youngest child is 16 years old and in school.  He still lives with her.  Her husband doesn't work for health reasons.\r\n\r\nRosa sells all kinds of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door and also sells from home where some of her customers come to buy.  She works every day, for two or three hours a day.  On weekends she works all day because on those days, in addition to selling, she also collects payment for goods she has left on credit.  She buys her merchandise in Manta or Guayaquil.  She has a lot of customers as she has been in this business for some years.\r\n\r\nRosa will use this loan to buy seasonal clothing such as swimsuits, shorts, t-shirts, blouses etc. as she has several orders.  This is her third loan through her community bank.  She is the group's president and she likes it because of the help that she receives from the institution.\r\n\r\nRosa's dream is to own a car with which to make her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the group photo, there is a member whose face cannot be seen because her daughter is covering it.  For this reason, we have added a small photo of the lady.

She lives with her husband and two children in Niena, in the region of Sikasso. \r\n\r\nHaving attempted several activities without success, including the sale of pagnes (colorful West-African cloth) and jewelry, Awa learned the business of stocking and selling cereals (millet, corn, rice, etc.) about four years ago. Thanks to her experience in this sector, she enjoys a great reputation but lacks the necessary resources to meet customer demand. She decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago, and all past loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nEager to satisfy a growing customer base, Awa is now seeking a new loan to purchase 30 sacks de millet, 1 tonne of corn and 5 sacks of sorghum. She buys her merchandise in the villages of Finkolo Ganadougou, Farakala and Niena. She stores the cereals in her Niena facility and sells at retail and wholesale to a diverse clientele, mostly for cash but sometimes on credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 75,000 CFAF, which she will use to cover the majority of her expenses as well as her family\u2019s, and to pay the interest on the loan. Any remainder will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1006097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niena","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":102225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251887,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":102225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449021,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102225.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268444,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":102225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102904,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":102225.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624764,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T13:32:09Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390540,"name":"Santos Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposa y con sus 2 hijos, su casa en la que actualmente viven est\u00e1 ubicada en  el  Caser\u00edo CP-2 C\u00f3lera, Distrito de Tambogrande, distrito que pertenece a la provincia a de Piura la cual esta ubicada a unas 3 horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo.

Her husband is a bricklayer. They live in Santo Domingo, a dynamic friendly city in the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas which was formed in 2007. The people who live here come from all corners of Ecuador which has given the area a diverse and entrepreneurial character. The subtropical climate is wet with an average temperature of 22.9\u00b0C. Because of its geographical location, it has many active businesses and has become the crossroads between the interior and the coast.\r\n\r\nFor five years Senobia has sold food in the streets.

They have a small house in a rural village called \"Sialupe Baca de Punto 9\" which is located some 20 minutes from Lambayeque district, which is 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  The people in Cristina's village mainly work in farming and livestock raising.  It is a developing area and, right now, the only basic service they have access to is electricity.\r\n\r\nCristina's daily business is raising and selling animals such as cattle, sheep, farmyard birds (ducks and turkeys), guinea pigs, etc.  This is a business that she has always worked in and she has approximately 10 years experience.  She inherited the business from her parents who taught her, from a very early age, how to buy and sell animals.  She has set up spaces on her property where she raises these animals.  In addition, Cristina also makes daily income selling 'chicha de jora' (a traditional, corn-based drink).  Her children and husband work together with her in undertaking new family projects.  They work every day to achieve their goals and thereby improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nCristina has clear and established goals.  She would like to buy nutritionally-balanced feed which she will use to fatten her animals.  She will also buy ingredients for making more 'chicha de jora'.  Cristina has requested a loan for 700 soles from Edpyme Alternativa which will help her to make more income.  This will enable her to improve her quality of life and also repay her loan.\r\n\r\nCristina has been an entrepreneurial woman since she was very young thanks to the values that her parents instilled in her.

He is single and doesn't have any children.  He is currently living in his parents' house and his parents support him financially.  They live in a poor urban village called Eureka which is located in Lambayeque district, 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  It is a small village which is home to approximately 50 families who mainly work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nEduardo's parents taught him to work from a very young age.  He has now decided to focus on offering a passenger transport service between villages, though he sometimes makes longer trips when he is hired by regular customers who ring him up when they need his services.  The vehicle which Eduardo uses for his work is hired from a family member to whom he gives a fixed sum every day.  Eduardo has been in this business for three years and has saved up 65% of the value of a new vehicle.  He has decided to buy a new vehicle so that he can make more income and thereby improve his parents' quality of life as well as his own.\r\n\r\nEduardo has his parents' complete support in working in his own business.  He used to work as a farm laborer whenever he wasn't working in his vehicle.  This meant that he was able to save up the sum of money he currently has.

Sadly, she also lost one of her children who left behind three orphans.  Magda raises them as if they were her own children.  They live together in their own home where Magda teaches them good habits every day\r\n\r\nEvery day Magda goes out to the market very early in the morning.  She goes looking for used clothing which she buys by the bundle and wholesale.  Once she has her products, she catches a vehicle or a boat, depending on where she is headed, and travels to the towns, farms or villages to offer her products for sale.  She sometimes exchanges her products for animals which she then takes back to sell in the city.  She has been in this business for 30 years and it has allowed her to raise and educate her children.  Her work is going very well as she always works as hard as she is able so that she can make enough income to meet her household's financial obligations.  In the future, Magda would like to have a grocery store in her home as she doesn't really enjoy having to travel because it is very heavy going.\r\n\r\nThis will be Magda's eighth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.

She is married to 61-year-old William and the couple have six children who are already grown up and live independently.  Milena lives in her own home together with her husband.  They both work hard as they would like to be able to save up enough to enjoy a peaceful old age.  Milena always knew that she would have to work hard to enjoy a comfortable life.  For this reason, she started working 20 years ago when she opened her small but very well-stocked grocery store.  Over time, she expanded her business and decided to start selling gas canisters because there wasn't a business of this type in her area.  This allowed her to make good profits.  Later on, she also opened a tire repair shop.  This is a business that she carries out with the help of her husband.  Her husband does the work while she runs the business.  It is doing very well as they enjoy good sales and have a lot of customers.  Milena knows that everything she has achieved has been the result of her effort and a lot of sacrifice.

Roberto is a member of the \"El Encanto de Pital\" communal bank, one of the 150 member organizations of Edesa in Costa Rica, and this is his first loan. \r\n\r\nHe will continue growing at the personal and financial level, besides participating actively in his community's credit organization.

They have three children, ages 21 and 19. She and her family live together in their own house, in the San Carlos neighborhood in Chanchamayo district. Eugenia is a tireless and strong-willed woman.  \r\n\r\nShe has been farming for 20 years, and grows fruit. She has twelve plots of crop land, where she grows coffee and bananas. She is aware that the work is very hard, and requires a great deal of dedication and investment, but she likes the work, because everything she gets is the product of her efforts. \r\n\r\nThe coffee provides her with annual income, and in the meantime, she pays for her daily expenses by growing bananas. \"I harvest 30 crates of bananas every week. I sell each one for ten soles,\" she says. She gets 200 sacks of coffee from her coffee plantation, and each one of them is 60 kilos. This way she gets from 600 to 800 soles for each sack, depending on the seasonal price.\r\n\r\nHer husband and older children help her with the work, but when there is more work to do, she resorts to hiring laborers.

","en":"54-year-old Juan has a small factory where he makes 'bollos de maiz'.  He lives together with his wife and his three children who are 18 and 19 years old.  He dreams of seeing his children become successful professionals and this is what he is working towards.  Juan's business was born when, through family tradition, he started making 'bollos de maiz' (a corn mixture, wrapped in leaves and tied with twine), in order to support his family.  He has achieved his goal as he has one son who is nearly a professional and the other two are also on this path, in a field they enjoy.  Juan makes his sales from home, for cash and on credit.  He also has a sales location outside a very well-known supermarket in the city, near his production site.  Juan's goal is to further strengthen his business every day and for his children to become well-respected professionals.  His greatest challenge is a lack of sufficient working capital when faced with growing demand.  He would like to buy in larger volumes so that he can obtain discounts.  This is precisely why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).

He is 41 years old and a widower. He lives with his young son in his own house, which was constructed on the basis of his labor. He lives in a rural village called Nueva Arica, which is located about 2 hours from the province of Chiclayo. The residents of the area in which he lives work totally in agriculture, livestock-raising, and handicrafts, among others. These are rural villages which are in the process of their development, so they only have basic electrical service.\r\n\r\nLeslier works daily to raise and later sell small animals such as ducks, turkeys, and hens, among others.

In addition, he also generates other daily income by working as a day laborer at various city properties.\r\n\r\nSince he was very young, Leslier worked in the fields, since his parents were always farmers. Now, with a family, he has decided to continue growing his business with the goal of giving a better education to his sons and therefore a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nBecause of his own desire to advance, Leslier has decided to apply to Edpyme Alternative for a loan in the amount of 2000 PEN for the purchase of balanced feed for his animals until they reach the ideal size and weight for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1003187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy balanced feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leslier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":144.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":148.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":151.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":158.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":170.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":174.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":178.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":186.3},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":191.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":196.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.39,"local_amount":139.7,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":140.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012131,"comment":null},{"amount":54.09,"local_amount":144.25,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":145.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621248,"comment":null},{"amount":55.82,"local_amount":148.85,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":149.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332617,"comment":null},{"amount":56.98,"local_amount":151.95,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":153.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423407,"comment":null},{"amount":59.48,"local_amount":158.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":159.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316805,"comment":null},{"amount":59.85,"local_amount":159.6,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":160.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373649,"comment":null},{"amount":411.39,"local_amount":1097.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1105.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308384918,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T19:20:37Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":391595,"name":"Sofig","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Sofig jenat i u nego chetvero detey.

She is the mother of Meylin, who is 2 years old.  She lives in her own house along with her live-in partner, Carlos, who is 28 years old.  She wants to offer a better quality of life to her family.  This is why she puts a lot of effort into her work.  Janina's work consists of selling clothing and shoes.  For quite some time she suffered some setbacks in her life.  This is because she did not have her own monetary income for her house.  It is for this reason that she decided a year ago to begin a new project.  She thought that her friends, neighbors, or relatives would want to buy clothing garments or shoes depending on the current season.  It is in this way that she began her business that is now giving her very good results.  She likes what she does, because it allows her to have time to be able to be with her young daughter.  Furthermore, since she began her business, she has been doing well economically, since they have two household incomes.  She wants to continue growing, and that is why she has in mind increasing her sales and being able to offer a greater variety and quality of garments to her customers.  This will be the 3rd loan with MFP, so she expects their collaboration to continue with her objectives.  On the other hand, she promises to pay her dues again in a punctual manner and to demonstrate, as in previous opportunities, that she is a very good partner.  In this way she will reward the support that is offered to her by her communal bank, where everyone is very responsible and supportive.  With the amount requested, 1500 soles, she will buy more merchandise since she desires to supply her scholastic campaign and offer school uniforms and shoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"buy school shoes and school uniforms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":235.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386517,"comment":null},{"amount":91.59,"local_amount":238.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":246.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099626,"comment":null},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":245.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713765,"comment":null},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":264.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202658,"comment":null},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":274.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098341,"comment":null},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":279.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401125,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T06:33:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392103,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonarda is 51 years old and widowed with eight children.
