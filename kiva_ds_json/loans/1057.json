She lives in a home built using good-quality materials, which she built with the help of her husband.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached adulthood, she inherited some plots of land from her grandparents, which she now farms to support her family. She has worked for nearly 12 years, supported by her husband. She explains that she likes her work, because it allows her to play a key role in providing for her family. However, the rainy season is a big hindrance to the normal performance of her work.\r\n\r\nOver time, she has noticed that her land requires additional help to optimize yield, which is why she wants to buy bags of organic fertilizer and grow superior crops.

they have a daughter, 5.  They share a house built of solid materials, which they rent.\r\n\r\nShe had an active presence helping her parents in agricultural labor ince she was very young.  In time she decided to turn this into her main source of income for her family, along with Alejandro, who produces organic cacao.\r\n\r\nShe says she likes her job because she's not tied to schedule pressures and because it's a job she can do with her family.

With her last loan, she invested in her business, where she sells food.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International Dominican Republic runs a program for their good clients, who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their businesses, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house, at the same time running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nAdriana is a single woman. She works and lives in a rural town in Samana. She will use this loan to buy cement and other construction materials to finish building her roof and the wall coating. She thanks God, Esperanza International Dominican Republic, and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and that of her family, she thanks all of you for your support!

They can request loans to improve their homes while running their businesses and attending groups meetings. \r\n\r\nElupina is living in a rural town with her long term partner and her only child. She started building her house with their family savings and her business profits. She took out loans with Esperanza almost three years ago to expand her business selling clothes.

Both members request a housing loan for their home improvement.\r\n\r\nElupina and Jimena thank you all for your

is a 63-year-old resident of Malibay, Pasay, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother. Her youngest is still in college. At her age, she is working as hard as she can to provide income for her everyday needs and to help her family as well.\r\n\r\nBenita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange and other brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalog and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 PHP in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBenita dreams of expanding her business and having her own stall. She hopes for good health and a strong body. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1294069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She and her husband manage their household together while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Imelda is requesting a PhP 17,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan funds to buy second-hand clothing items and new merchandise such as undergarments to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nImelda hopes eventually to add more stalls and dreams of providing her children with a good education.

children.  All of the children attend school.  The oldest daughter is graduating from school this year.  Gulsara has been involved in animal husbandry since 1995, having started this business with an initial sum of 5,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, today the business contains one dairy cow and five sheep, and the monthly profit from sales of milk to the local processing plant amounts to about 8,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Gulsara requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy 15 sheep.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further expanding her business and providing an education for her

She is 28 years old.  She has been helping her parents raise livestock since childhood.  After getting married, her life has been very hard because her husband is involved in providing house repairs, and his income is very small.  Marguba is raising three children.  Her children grow year after year and demand more comforts.  She decided to organize her own business to earn an income.  With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association for Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  She learned a lot of new information from this course for herself and wrote her business plan.  She wants to organize a business of buying and selling livestock because she has experience in this type of business.  Marguba is requesting a loan in the amount of 1500 somoni to buy livestock in order to start her new business.  This loan will help her to improve her living conditions and, thus, bring happiness to her home.  She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1293748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Then the family can live in a comfortable, warm house.  They will be able to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

is from the small town of Lagodekhi. She is 48 years old, married, and lives with her husband, son and a daughter-in-law. Nino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers. The only source for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Nino\u2019s husband working as a cook. The income is hardly enough for the four-member family. Nino\u2019s loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the loan, Nino will purchase clothing and bed clothing at wholesale prices and resell them in her town and nearby villages for a profit. It will be hard work for Nino, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living

He has a big fifteen year experience in the field of animal husbandry. His father was engaged in livestock breeding and Nemat since childhood helped his father. \r\n\r\nHe had one sheep for which he had to provide care. As Nemat himself says, \"I was very fond of that little gray sheep. Then that was a child's enthusiasm. Now this is my income and life earnings.\" He grew up and followed in his father's footsteps. He started his activities with two heads of sheep. Initially, it was not easy for him, especially in the winter when the whole earth was covered with snow and he had to spend more money to feed the livestock. But years of experience proved themselves out and Nemat began to find ways to address the challenges and to better promote his business. \r\n\r\nNow, he has more than 50 head of sheep. His wife and three children are also involved in the business. Nemat is also a master bricklayer and plasterer. He works part-time for accommodation, his children's education and daily expenses. \r\n\r\nDue to the season, he cannot sell his sheep now as prices have fallen. Nemat needs additional resources to continue caring for his livestock and to acquire new livestock. To this end, he appealed to MDO Arvand for a loan. He plans to use the loan to buy livestock. He is grateful to Arvand for the support and their huge rule in his life.

She is a motivated and successful woman. Her husband Bakhtier is proud of her. They have one child who is not yet an adult. Gulbahor lives together with her family happily, but poorly. \r\n\r\nTheir income does not allow them to buy all the necessary things for a living, and therefore Gulbahor decided to organize her own business buying and selling men's clothing. To that end, she took a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women and received a certificate. From this course, she learned a lot, and now she is ready to organize her own business. She will trade in the local market, and her husband will help her in running the business.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 15,000 somoni to buy goods, in order to establish a new business.

The more fish displayed at her stall the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to cover her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAngelina hopes that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week; there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance

His children are all grown, and three live separately outside the home.  Nurmuhamed's wife works in the home and his children actively help out as well.  While searching for a source of income in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapsed, Nurmuhamed started his own business with 10,000 KGS, working with livestock.    Thanks to his tenacity and perseverance, today his business brings in around 15,000 KGS each month from the sale of diary and meat products, and he now has three head of cattle, five goats, and one horse.  The income from his business allowed Nurmhamed to marry off his children.  With the goal of further increasing the number among his livestock, Nurmuhamed has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy two horses.  He plans to use his profits to expand the number of his livestock even further as well as to save for his youngest son's wedding.

Since 1995, Gulnara has worked with livestock, having started her business with an initial sum of 10,000 KGS.   Thanks to her hard work, the business has developed under Gulnara's care.  She now brings in around 10,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk, and the reselling of cattle.  With the goal of further growth, Gulnara has turned to the company Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 80,000 KGS to buy five head of cattle and one dairy cow.  With the profits from the loan, Gulnara plans to increase the number of domestic animals among her livestock in order to have the opportunity to marry off her sons and daughter in the near future.

She did not agree to become a maid or a waitress, because such work was not to her liking. For her it was a great joy to take a course \"Bring It On\" organized by the Association of Business Women. From this course, she learned a lot of new things about business and wrote her own business plan. Now, she is fully able to establish her own business and to become successful in this sphere. She wants to start a business buying and selling women's and children's clothing, as this type of business has high demand among the population. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 5,000 somoni to buy goods to establish a new business.

She will use her loan to purchase pigs to start an animal husbandry business. She will put the pigs in a shed in the yard and raise and sell them for a higher price. Natasha's loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country rural poor who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. Natasha's new business initiative, financed with her Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1294291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Makharadze","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-02-15T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-17T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natasha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":290}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:07:31Z","rounded_local_amount":87.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861393,"comment":null},{"amount":49.33,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570197,"comment":null},{"amount":52.42,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":87.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968830,"comment":null},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:51:09Z","rounded_local_amount":87.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749248,"comment":null},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":92.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613154,"comment":null},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856881,"comment":null},{"amount":58.59,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":97.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133544,"comment":null},{"amount":185,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":307.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107149,"comment":null},{"amount":185,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":307.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254724,"comment":null},{"amount":178.83,"local_amount":290,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":296.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440018903,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T16:31:44Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:40:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":527580,"name":"Nana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nana is 32 years old and lives in the Samtredia district.

He is dedicated. He has a stand where customers visit. He buys supplies daily in order to make pizza and natural juices, which pleases his customers.\r\n\r\nCurrently he is asking for a Kiva loan, his first financing being made through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy salsas, meat, and a cart to transport tortillas.\r\n\r\nHis main clients are neighbors, many of who come from his hometown and are faithful to him, as he works energetically in order to successfully influence them.

For four years she has made a living in commerce, an activity with which she generates income that supports the well-being of her family.  Her main products are various brands of cosmetics as she works through a system of catalogues, that is to say she makes her promotions with 4 specialized product guides coming from multinational companies with which she establishes her business relations.  In her strategy she deals with the market of Puerto Colombia and also she has customers in the city of Barranquilla, located 20 minutes away.  In order to deliver the products she requests 50% and gives credit for the rest of the value of the products that each customer chooses, taking into account a payment plan that she establishes with each one, not exceeding 30 days.  Gradually, her requests for orders increases, particularly in the special seasons, like the one which occurs soon, when families celebrate Mothers' Day.  In her house she always has an inventory of the products that rotate more, so that her clients, when they ask her for something, aren\u2019t leaving empty-handed.  She always takes advantage of the offers that the magazines carry, in order to have an impact on her market.  \r\n\r\nAmong her goals is that of organizing a small storehouse and for this she has planned her Kiva loan, her second financing made from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the first financing she bought a metal display cabinet to organize her inventory and products that have been requested by her clientele, such as perfumes, feminine accessories, items of costume jewelry, etc.  The reason for the success of her investment is her great experience, the opportunity to purchase special offers in greater quantities and that she makes them precisely in the season where the sales are increased as a result of the special days like carnivals.  That is why she turns to a Kiva loan with which she will buy colognes, perfumes, creams, cosmetics, deodorants and feminine undergarments.

I was the lead worker and drew up to 110 liters of milk every day and looked after the cows.  The cows even had their own names.  Since then, I still have a passion for livestock.\"\r\n\r\nLike many others, Kumri was left without work when the factory closed.  Tough times came and she decided to start her own small farm.  At that moment, her ten years of experience came in handy.  She bought two cows, sold their milk, and she began to earn a living this way.  Kumri's husband helped her with the raising and feeding of the cows.  Thanks to her her work and positive attitude, Kumri was able to raise her three small children.  But a year ago, she lost one cow to an illness and she had to sell the other because she needed the money.  Now Kumri has one cow and she wants to get another one.  With this goal in mind, she turned to \"Arvand\" for financial support.  She wants to raise livestock and sell their milk so she can earn a living.  That way, she will be able to put aside some of her husband's money to save for her children's future.

She is married to Soriano, a construction worker, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. Teresita is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store sells inexpensive items, often asking a single price for each item in the store. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Teresita purchases her inventory at wholesale prices and then sells it by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She does a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business and having a peaceful and a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1294853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to help her continue the operations of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMaribel dreams of being successful in her business and dreams of having a peaceful and a good life.
