is 37 years old and married to a farmer.

Jean will use the profits from the farming to build a house for his residences.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She purchases this from the gas distributors, and they take care of delivering it to her business. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy 8 quintals of corn and 10 cylinders of gas. All of the materials that she will buy will be used in the production of tortillas for a month. To make pupusas on weekends she will buy 4 pounds of pork rinds and 4 pounds of soft cheese. She will also use the new loan to pay the balance on her current loan. \r\n\r\nHaving purchased all of these ingredients she will be able to make tortillas for a whole month (even during corn shortages). When she buys these products she will increase her supplies and, therefore, the level of sales since the demand is quite high. She will be able to make a larger number of products to be sold. \r\n\r\nShe has plans to buy land in the future because she is currently renting a home. Depending on how the sale and profits from the tortillas go, she would later like to begin building a small house for herself and her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":381.18,"image":{"id":1171246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy 8 quintals of corn and 10 gas cylinders.

Since a young age Isomidin has been helping his family to grow various crops. After a while he was able to rent some land of his own and has been farming there ever since.

He is married and has three children. He lives in a small village together with his family. Bahodur loves nature and outdoors and since childhood has spent a lot of time in the pasture, where he helped his father raise cattle. Now he has his own family and is doing everything in his power to provide for his wife and children. To have a steady income and support his families needs, Bahodur has turned to the trade he knew since he was little: he raises cattle and sells the animals once they are mature. He makes a good living with this business and is taking out this loan to purchase more animals for his herd. At the time of his first loan Bahodur only had two cows but his herd has now grown to ten animals. Aside from raising cattle, Bahodur also grows produce on a small plot of land which yields additional profits. He grows various staples crops for sale at the local market. Now Bahodur wants to expand his business and will use the next loan to purchase another cow. He is hopeful that he will be able to complete all of his business goals so that he can improve life for his family. Bahodur is grateful in advance for Arvand's support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1327909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T19:50:05Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahodur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":653.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":679.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":653.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":679.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-16T05:05:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550405,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys, de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus cuatro hijos en su casa propia .El negocio que tiene Gladys es la venta de comidas regionales por las noches pero tambi\u00e9n prepara distintos platos de comida para venderlos en el horario de almuerzo.

","en":"Hilola is a good woman. She is 29 years old, single and lives with her parents. She has always dreamed to start her own business but in the past she had no support and no savings. As Hilola lives in rural Tajikistan she has experience raising cattle and growing crops. After she took the class \"Achieve Success\" organized by Association of Businesswomen she was able to plan her business on her own.

Madina is requesting a loan of 2000 somoni to purchase fabrics for her sewing studio. She awaits your kindness.

Buhojal's trade is raising cattle and she took over this business from her diseased husband. Her only daughter works in the local school and they are still living together. Buhojal's daughter also supplements the family's budget. Buhojal's nephew is responsible for taking the cattle for resale at the livestock market. Every month he drives the mature animals to the market and immediately buys new calves for feeding. Buhojal's business has been yielding good profits and she is grateful to her nephew for the help. Aside from cattle, Buhojal also grows tomatoes and cucumbers for sale. Currently Buhojal wants to expand her herd and so has turned to Arvand for a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1328997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buhojal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":966.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":999.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209.48,"local_amount":966.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":997.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900900,"comment":null},{"amount":216.59,"local_amount":999.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550082,"comment":null},{"amount":223.93,"local_amount":1033.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1066.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774307,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T22:35:00Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549291,"name":"Rustam","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432 \u044e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438. \u0415\u043c\u0443 52 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431, \u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431 -

","en":"Muhabbat is 42 years old. She is married and has three children. Muhabbat lives in a remote region where the main ways of life are farming and raising livestock. Muhabbat has been growing various crops, such as tomatoes, rice, wheat and other grains for more then 15 years now. Her husband does not help her as he has his own business and is busy. However, her daughter and her daughter-in-law do help take care of the crops. Muhabbat grows 0.5 hectare of wheat and 0.1 hectare of tomatoes. She brings in two harvests per year, because she plants wheat and tomatoes in the spring and corn and rice in the fall. She loves her farm and is a repeated client with IMON. Muhabbat is requesting this loan because she spent all her savings for family needs this year and needs to purchase seeds and fertilizer for spring planting. She is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni and promises to repay it on time.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1320.4,"image":{"id":1333349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds and mineral fertilizers for her land where she grows wheat and tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-04-18T20:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-18T20:40:04Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":705.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":734.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":755.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":769.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":791.85},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":809.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":848.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":867.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":885.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":917.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":947.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":967.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":148.06,"local_amount":705.06,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":705.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915725,"comment":null},{"amount":154.32,"local_amount":734.85,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":735.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693415,"comment":null},{"amount":158.61,"local_amount":755.3,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":755.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556229,"comment":null},{"amount":161.65,"local_amount":769.75,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":770.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550069,"comment":null},{"amount":166.29,"local_amount":791.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":792.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959046,"comment":null},{"amount":174.97,"local_amount":833.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":833.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075201,"comment":null},{"amount":174.14,"local_amount":829.23,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":829.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430227898,"comment":null},{"amount":182.36,"local_amount":868.39,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":868.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439988893,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T22:43:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549447,"name":"Mar\u00eda Belis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene un hijo.

Twelve years ago, after having been an employee in a company, she started her own business venture once she managed to put together some savings for a variety of merchandise.  Her business grew little by little and she made adjustments with furniture and equipment to display her offerings.\r\n\r\nCurrently she has applied for two loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization with which she has managed to increase her stock and her wholesale purchases for her business.  She has more cash and more customers.  This is exactly why she wants a Kiva loan, to respond to customer requests.  She wants to expand and strengthen her business more all the time.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she'll buy clothing, footwear, paper supplies, cosmetics, and other items.\r\n\r\nMarinella's customers will be

The children are attending a public school near their home. Camila lives with her husband and children in the Chig\u00fcilpe Parish, 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, capital of the Province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. This is a place with very active commerce, since it has become a terrestrial port of exchange between Ecuador's coastal and mountain regions. This parish has some homes made of cement and some made of both wood and cement. It has a river which is popular with visitors, where tourists and local inhabitants practice various sports, and they also have the opportunity to get to know the Ts\u00e1chila culture, since the people tend to tell their legends to visitors around a campfire, on camping trips. Santo Domingo, which has the third largest population in the region, also contributes with activities such as agriculture, ranching, fishing and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nCamila saw the need to provide income within her family, since her husband's work as a teaching director was not sufficient to support their household, mainly because their children are growing and they need to cover higher costs for education, clothing, etc. For this reason, five years ago Camila began selling cosmetics and jewelry, which gave her a certain percentage of profit on her sales, and she also obtained prizes which she uses in her home. She learned from a friend who encouraged her to do this work, and now she dedicates at least 8 hours to it. This hard-working mother now wants to start selling casual clothing, for which purpose she needs a loan with which she will buy merchandise on a wholesale basis in a warehouse where they offer attractive discounts. Thus she will be able to visit her customers and offer them this new product. In this way, her profits will increase and her household's standard of living will improve. Camila is grateful to the Alternativa Foundation for the excellent service they have provided to her in giving her support to achieve her dreams. She is very satisfied with the flexibility, confidence, services and advising of her executive committee, which has allowed her to have hope for her future. She believes that the Kiva product is very appropriate for people like her who are looking for the opportunity to obtain capital to achieve their dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025.48,"image":{"id":1335192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy seasonal clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Camila Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":128.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":131.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":139.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":142.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":145.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":147.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.27,"local_amount":106.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":107.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133253,"comment":null},{"amount":122.62,"local_amount":121.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":122.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313792,"comment":null},{"amount":125.91,"local_amount":124.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565397,"comment":null},{"amount":127.52,"local_amount":126.29,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":127.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814436,"comment":null},{"amount":130.03,"local_amount":128.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":130.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320608,"comment":null},{"amount":133.23,"local_amount":131.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":133.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856298,"comment":null},{"amount":136.44,"local_amount":135.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":136.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059873,"comment":null},{"amount":142.46,"local_amount":141.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":142.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995216,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T23:02:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545949,"name":"Mujeres De Fe Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Silvia Lorena es casada, de 36 a\u00f1os de edad y de escolaridad 3 a\u00f1os secundaria, tiene 6 hijos y de ellos 3 estan estudiando, ella se dedica a vender comida y tortillas, inici\u00f3 este negocio con un peque\u00f1o capital y hasta el momento lleva 8 a\u00f1os de experiencia.

She also has a grinding machine in her house. Apart from this, her husband takes outdoor orders for making sweets items for marriage parties and social functions. Binodini makes a monthly income of 5,000 Indian rupees (INR) from the above business. With this income, she is hardly able to manage her household and the educational expenses of her children. So, she wants to expand her business by taking out a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. With the present loan, Binodini wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she has to replenish her stock frequently. She also wants to use a portion of the loan to repair her tiffin stall. Binodini hopes to save enough to build a good house of her own as her present house is a small hut.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Ranju, Mamata and Sailabala who are running a barber shop, tiffin stall and tiffin push cart respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1333207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for purchasing of oil, dough, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ranju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sailabala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":52000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T10:34:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549211,"name":"Lona Monday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lona Monday is a 35-year-old businesswoman who lives in Yei.

She lives with her husband and four sons, ages 27, 24, 21 and 18 years. To increase the income of her family, in the year 2011, Taruni along with four other like-minded women from her village formed a group named <i>Thakurani<\/i> and availed a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nTaruni is running two businesses. One is procurement of seasonal agricultural products like paddy, pulses, etc., and selling them in the market at a higher price. Another one is a milk business. The husband of Taruni goes from market to market and procures the products. Taruni helps her husband to stock the materials in their residence. She also does her milk business from her house.\r\n\r\nTaruni earns a monthly income of 6,000 Indian rupees from the present business. From this small income, she can hardly manage her family's expenses. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business to increase her income.

Her husband left for England, so she is living at her father's home with her two children, in Kamalen Sirakoro, one of the suburbs of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nFor the past ten years Mariam has been selling wax \"pagnes\" (colorful West-African fabrics), bedsheets, shoes, embroidered fabrics, brooms etc.  She works from home and also sells door to door in Sikasso, where she is a very popular seller, thanks to the quality of her merchandise.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the needs of an increasing number of customers, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After taking several solidarity loans through a local women's association, she is now taking her fourth individual loan.  She is planning to use this loan to buy 15 wax pagnes, 25 pairs of shoes of various quality, ten pieces of embroidered fabric (each measuring 1 x 3 m) and some boxes of brooms.  She buys her merchandise locally and in Bobo Dioulasso (republic of Burkina Faso) and resells door to door, for cash or on credit, to a retail customer base which mostly consists of women.  Her previous loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Mariam is expecting monthly profits to reach 110,000 CFA francs, which will be used in part to contribute to the family's expenses, to pay off her loan's interest, while the rest will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":533.33,"image":{"id":1334926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy various items such as pagnes (colorful West-African fabrics), shoes, fabrics and brooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030141,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819641,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678538,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924169,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207372,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972022,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624689,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":33521.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T05:39:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550465,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio Cesar, labora en el centro de la cuidad de Medell\u00edn desde hace m\u00e1s de 28 a\u00f1os.

She is the mother of 4 children of which only one studies.  The others work and are independent.  She lives in the city of Granada and she sells new clothes. She makes clothes for infants such as sheets, shirts, pillowcases, dresses, shoes, and various other items for infant wear. She began to work in sewing when she was 15 years old.  Her mother taught this trade to her and to her sisters.  Thanks to what they learned, she has survived. In addition to selling infant wear, she also sells new clothes for men and women. She began to get income from this activity 5 years ago. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy fabric, different colored thread, bath towels, pants, blouses, underwear, etc. This loan will allow her to sell and to gain new clients. One of her plans is to have savings for her retirement. Even though her children say they will not leave her by herself, she wants to have her own savings.

She has made a living as a caretaker at a home for the past six years, which provides her with continuity and stability. She works Monday-Friday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and on the weekends she travels to some of the surrounding communities to sell all kinds of clothing as well as cosmetics. She came to the offices of Kiva partner CEPRODEL requesting a loan to belong to the water and sanitation alliance. This will allow her to build a bathroom that will include a toilet, shower and sink as well as a septic tank, since the current conditions aren't very good. In this way she will have these essential services inside her home and have a more dignified place to live with improved conditions, since the latrines contaminate the environment and through this project she will be able to enjoy better health and hygiene and avoid illnesses.

Currently Mary is the head of her family, in which she has the great responsibility of educating and providing for her children, with whom she lives in her rented home in the city of Ibarra, the capital of the province of Imbabura. This city belongs to La Sierra and is located in the northern part of Ecuador. Its summery weather, its festivals, and its friendly inhabitants are the main attractions for national and international tourists. Art and culture predominate, but many people have also launched tourist projects which offer visits to waterfalls, rivers, and lagoons, as well as walks to places which show the culture of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nFor eight years Jaqueline has sold candy, fruit, and vegetables in order to support her home. No obstacle has stopped her from continuing to fight for the wellbeing of her children. Besides having a space in the market to make her sales, she also goes out to public places when there are events on which attract multitudes of people. Thanks to the enterprising spirit which she inherited from her whole family, she has made the business grow and she spends 7 or 8 hours each day working, and a little longer when events are on as she stays late into the night, but the difficulty of obtaining loans with some institutions has made growth very difficult; however, thanks to various recommendations by friends and family, she has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan which she will invest in purchasing additional products to meet customers\u2019 demands and obtain greater profits on her sales. With these profits she will be able to fulfill her dream of relocating her business to a bigger, wider, and more comfortable place for her and her customers, and further down the track she will be able to buy her own house. Jaqueline hopes that people from all over the world will hear her story through Kiva and that they will be able to help her and all of those who fight for their dreams through microenterprise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1020.44,"image":{"id":1335289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase products for stocking her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Ibarra","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T09:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T09:50:09Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaqueline Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":126.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":128.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":131.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":136.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":139.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":141.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.19,"local_amount":107.15,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":108.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133254,"comment":null},{"amount":122.54,"local_amount":121.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313793,"comment":null},{"amount":125.82,"local_amount":124.61,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565398,"comment":null},{"amount":127.44,"local_amount":126.21,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":127.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814437,"comment":null},{"amount":129.94,"local_amount":128.69,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":129.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320609,"comment":null},{"amount":133.13,"local_amount":131.85,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856299,"comment":null},{"amount":135.13,"local_amount":133.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":135.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059874,"comment":null},{"amount":138.25,"local_amount":136.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":138.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995217,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T21:45:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549794,"name":"Simona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow and a plot of agricultural land. They milk the cow to make dairy products. On the land mandarin and nut trees are grown. Harvested products with the dairy products are sold locally at the markets. The family total income is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nJaba requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Jaba will open a car-washing service. He will purchase the essential car-washing equipment and vacuum cleaners for starting the business. In order to decrease the expense and not to pay salary to somebody else, Jaba will work himself to wash the cars. This will significantly increase the profit and he will use part of it to reinvest and develop his business.

She prepares and sells breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals.  She offers this service at her business premises located next to her home.  Her customers are mainly truck drivers that come to the city on a trip, and pedestrians that habitually pass by her stall and who are workers in the area.  \r\n\r\nHer sales are done in cash, and her daily schedule begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 10 p.m.  With financing, her business has improved.  She has had six loans and they have strengthened her working capital, her sales, and her utilities.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is to pay attention to her growing clientele, because as her customer base grows, her capital is insufficient to respond to the demand.  This is the reason that she requests a loan through Kiva.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy those materials and ingredients, wholesale and with cash, that she needs to prepare her foods (rice, meats, vegetables, canned items, sugar, salt), adding new menu items to her daily service.  With this investment, she expects to be successful because she is very focused on the demand in her market, and she serves this market with a lot of care.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":317.16,"image":{"id":1335362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy those materials and ingredients, in greater volume and with cash, that she uses to prepare her foods (rice, meats, vegetables, canned items, sugar, salt).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":57811},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82960},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":84896},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86877},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88904},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":90978},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":93101},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":95273},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":97496},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":99771},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102099},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":104482},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106919},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":109414},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":111967},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":114580},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":117253},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":155219}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.51},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":57811,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":57871.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705904,"comment":null},{"amount":44.94,"local_amount":82960,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83046.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968192,"comment":null},{"amount":45.99,"local_amount":84896,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":84984.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817379,"comment":null},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":86877,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-30T08:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":86967.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323652,"comment":null},{"amount":48.16,"local_amount":88904,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":88997.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082886,"comment":null},{"amount":49.28,"local_amount":90978,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91073.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062251,"comment":null},{"amount":50.43,"local_amount":93101,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":93198.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T17:44:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549305,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is requesting another Kiva loan of 40,000 KES.

Elza\u2019s only source of income is her small monthly salary, 250 Laris\/month, as a waitress at a local cafe.  This is hardly enough to buy food for the family.  According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nElza requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business.  Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products.  This group is regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.  With the received credit, Elza will begin selling clothing and household goods.  She plans to go to Turkey to purchase the clothing and household goods at wholesale prices and then resell them among her villagers.  Elza will do her best to increase the family income and improve the living conditions for her son.  This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the life of the family.

is 68 years old, married, and has one adult child.

In addition, they have a commercial space, which is rented out as a grocery shop and they receive a small monthly payment. Total income of the family is so small that it is not enough to cover their monthly expenses, including food. \r\n\r\nRobert's loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers.\u201d With the loan, Robert will purchase grocery stocks. He wants to stop renting his commercial space and use it to open a grocery shop himself. This business will be profitable as the shop is already well known by locals.

This borrower has in the household  mosquito nets, electricity, a sewing machine, TV, DVD player but does not have solar power or running water.<p>\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275.38,"image":{"id":1333448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

positive 36 year old woman. She is married and has four children. Muhayo loves her children and wants to make sure they lack in nothing. Together with her husband she earns money to feed her family and provide a good eduction for her children. She wants her children to have a promising future. Muhayo's husband is a migrant worker in Russia. Every month he sends money to his family. But Muhayo herself doesn't like to be idle, she is always in motion and is a very hard working woman.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband provide for the family Muhayo has started her own business. She sells Tajik national women's dresses and has had her business for 11 years. She purchases clothes in the city at a central market then sells them in her own village to the local women. It's very convenient for her clients, as many of them rarely visit the city and are happy to be able to buy clothes in their own village. Every time she comes back from the city the demand for her dresses grows and she needs to be able to purchase more inventory on her next trip. For this reason Muhayo has turned to Arvand for a loan which she will use to purchase a batch of traditional Tajik dresses. Muhayo is grateful for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1447.77,"image":{"id":1326499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy women's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-19T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-19T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhayo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":787.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":813.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":840.15},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":867.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":896.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":956.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":987.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1020.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1053.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.78},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":161.14,"local_amount":762.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":767.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971483,"comment":null},{"amount":166.45,"local_amount":787.48,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":792.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752004,"comment":null},{"amount":171.92,"local_amount":813.39,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616092,"comment":null},{"amount":177.58,"local_amount":840.15,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":845.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859961,"comment":null},{"amount":183.42,"local_amount":867.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":873.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136706,"comment":null},{"amount":189.45,"local_amount":896.34,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":902.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900902,"comment":null},{"amount":195.69,"local_amount":925.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":932.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550084,"comment":null},{"amount":202.12,"local_amount":956.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":962.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774309,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T01:53:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549368,"name":"Albert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Albert is 35 years old.

His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Albert will install gas equipment in his car, since it is much cheaper than petrol. He will continue driving the taxi and his profit will be significantly increased. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.
