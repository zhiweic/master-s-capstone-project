","en":"Mullobobo was born in a remote village far from urban centers. He has turned to our organization for a loan for the first time in order to expand his business. Mullobobo works in agribusiness and he owns a grain combine and a small truck. He uses his combine to harvest grain for other farmers in the region and the truck for transporting the grain. This has been his source of income for 14 years and Mullobobo has a lot of experience. Also, his second son helps him drive the vehicles while his first son has been working as a migrant in Russia for over a year.

Her name is Zulfiya. She is married and has one young child. For the longest time Zulfiya had no significant income. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia who's small salary can't provide for all the needs of the family. To better provide for their child Zulfiya decided to start raising livestock, something she has learned as a child by helping her parents. She spent a long time looking for help and finally learned about the \"Achieve Success\" course offered by the Association of Business Women. She participated in the class and learned many useful things. Now she is ready to start her own business, but she lacks savings to purchase livestock. Zulfiya has turned to us for a loan of 1500 somoni which she will use to buy livestock.

He has experienced a great deal in his 26 years. Abduhamid was born into a large family. He is the eldest son and his parents have six more children. He has to help his parents because his father can't support such a large family by himself. It is the responsibility of the eldest son to help his father take care of his siblings. After graduating from high school Abduhamid attended driving school and completed it with a good grade. After receiving his driver's license he started to work as an independent taxi driver. His taxi service allowed him to improve his family's life and he himself was able to marry and now has two children. Abduhamid's wife is all day busy with the kids and household chores. His younger sister is now attending college and Abduhamid has helped her financially to make it possible. \r\n\r\nAbduhamid has turned to our organization in March 2012 for the first time. He used the loan to buy a minibus for his shuttle taxi service. This loan allowed him to start working. Now he is again turning to \"Arvand\" for a loan.

is living with one child and her only child goes to school. She also takes care of additional family members (her mother). She has a business of selling used clothes and has been in this business for 1-1\/2 years and has applied for a loan of 400,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT-SACCO to buy more bales of used clothes. She doesn't have any other income generating activity. She moves door to door selling used clothes and sells on a retail basis only five days out of every week.

This is 41-year-old Isatu from the eastern area of Waterloo, in Freetown. She is married with five children between the ages of 8 and 19; her children are attending school. She began her business after vocational training school.  \r\n\r\nIsatu runs a beauty salon within a busy market area; she sells hair, shampoo, conditioner, and hair cream. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business six days per week, ten hours a day.

She began this business to create a source of income to take care of her children.\r\n\r\nKadiatu runs a grocery business at her house. She sells eggs, cigarettes and bread. She has been running this business since 2000. She works at the business from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm.  At present, she lacks sufficient capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to purchase bags of rice, sardines, butter and soft drinks for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to have a permanent residence with her family, because at present she is sleeping in the shop room. It will also help her increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a house. She appreciates your support.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":254.79,"image":{"id":1358191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase bags of rice, sardines, butter and soft drinks for resale.

27-year-old Baindu from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 2 and 8 years. One of her children is currently attending school. In 2010, Baindu established her general stock business. She began her business because she wants to help her family. She works at the business from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m., Morning to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nBaindu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like palm oil, bags of rice, soft drinks and cooking seasoning. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and buy a piece of land. In the future, Baindu plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

Sarah says that the main challenges to her business are the problem of transportation to travel with her goods and difficulty to travel during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nSarah has requested a loan in order to purchase charcoal and wood.

This group is located in Hato Mayor, a rural area in the Dominican Republic. Valentina lives with her long-term partner and her five children in a simple home in the rural village of Hato Mayor, where the cacao harvest is one of the main economic activities.\r\n\r\nValentina is an excellent Esperanza client and has successfully repaid seven loans. With this loan, her 16th, she plans to buy fruit and cacao. She sells in her community and to chocolate producers.

She has been running this business since 2008. She works at the business every day, moving around the community to introduce her goods.  She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nHawanatu has requested a loan in order to purchase more cosmetics like hair cream, vaseline, powder and soap.

Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a northern port town whose economy is dependent on tourism. She makes her home there in a simple structure as a single mother with four children.\r\n\r\nJusta is excited to be taking out her ninth loan with Esperanza after having fully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling chicharrones (fried pork fat) and clothing by purchasing pork, different clothes and underwear to sell.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living.

Jan. 2, 1991, Patricia has been self-employed  in her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama through her business W. Preschool. \r\n\r\nThe Christian learning institution is a place where three- and four-year-olds can prep for kindergarten. It\u2019s a school Patricia describes as generational; the students she has taught in the past now have children she currently teaches.\r\n\r\nPatricia began working with children in the 1980s as a social worker, but then lost her job. However, it wasn\u2019t hard for her to get back on her feet. She was employed as a substitute teacher then as a teacher at different day care centers until she decided to open her own. \u201c(Teaching) is my calling,\u201d Patricia said. \r\n\r\nTaking her calling seriously, Patricia is strict to decide who can work with her. Today, she employs four part-time and four full-time workers.  Patricia describes her employees are life-time employees; some have worked with her until retirement. She plans to keep her preschool employed with the same familiar faces to provide a comfortable and trust-worthy learning environment.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of her preschool allows Patricia to continue accepting students. Her business has grown enough that she now needs to move from the home her preschool is housed in, to a larger facility. \r\n\r\nWhile talking to the person who completes her payroll, Patricia noticed the facility she is moving into needed a lot of work; that\u2019s when her payroll advisor informed her about nonprofit microlender Accion Texas Inc.\r\n\r\nShe applied and was approved for a loan to help repair the new building. Patricia needed three new doors, new locks, toys for the children and funds to cover the move.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Accion for the opportunity to expand her business and for trusting her: \u201cThe loan was truly a blessing for me. Without it, I would not have been able to move so soon.\u201d Patricia said.

She is married and has two young children with her husband.  They all live together in their own home.  Ingrid makes a living hiring out her mototaxi to a driver to use on the city's streets every day.  At the end of the day she receives a payment for the rental that allows her to cover household costs.  Ingrid started the business four years ago and her daily income has remained stable.  Before, she made a living making and selling bread but she left this business when she fell pregnant.  However, now Ingrid does not like not going out to work and so wants to open a small grocery store in her home so that she can add another income to the mototaxi rental.  Ingrid enjoys all the work she does and has no doubts about putting more effort in to work with a positive attitude every day.  Ingrid's big dream now is to repair another vehicle she has that is not used.  She wants it to be used for work so that she can add to her main source of income.  On this occasion, Ingrid is applying for 800 Nuevo Soles and is very happy knowing that she will have financial support so that she can continue trying to achieve her goals.  The loan will be invested in buying tyres and to repair the drive system on the mototaxi that does not currently work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1358303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy tyres and pay for vehicle maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-25T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-24T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":126.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":136.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":138.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":146.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.94,"local_amount":125.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-24T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530586,"comment":null},{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":126.84,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":136.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975674,"comment":null},{"amount":51.34,"local_amount":126.37,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":135.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996942,"comment":null},{"amount":55.36,"local_amount":136.28,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":146.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864412,"comment":null},{"amount":56.33,"local_amount":138.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352780,"comment":null},{"amount":59.5,"local_amount":146.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":157.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-25T22:29:55Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":564166,"name":"Lucia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Lucia.

46 years old and a citizen of Sampov Meas district of Pursat province, is married and blessed with six children. Currently, two of her kids are still in school while the remaining are paid workers in Thailand. To strive for a living, she manages two hectares of rice farming while her husband works at a local non- profit organization in the area. She is able to earn about 38,000 KHR from the current business that she has been with for 13 years.\r\n\r\n This is the third micro-loan for Ny with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

is 42, married, and has five children. She is a very smart and hardworking housewife, who takes responsibility for most of the non-financial matters in her household, such as maintaining the home and caring for the children.

She is married and has 3 children who live with her.  They plant and cultivate coffee crops and basic grains.  Irma does not have an education as her parents had scarce financial resources and could not provide for her education.  She has a lot of experience in this type of activity. She has been growing coffee and grains for more than 30 years as her parents taught her very young.  Her products are sold and commercialized by different buyers who come to the area, and by people who are in nearby areas.  The land that they cultivate is their own, and she travels by mule with along with her husband and children to do maintenance such as: applying fertilizer, cleaning up, cutting and fertilizing to prevent their crop from being damaged or contaminated by disease.  Irma is requesting a loan to purchase fertilizers to maintain her coffee crops and have an excellent harvest.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue to expand her crops to generate more income and continue investing in coffee production.  One of the greatest challenges is the constant increase in prices of supplies which are very helpful for ensuring that that they can use 100% of their production.  This will allow her to provide a better education to her children and improve her quality of life. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7.88,"image":{"id":1358310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer for her coffee crops.

Her primary income sources are eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Poultry farming'.  Her biggest challenge is 'Crop diseases.' Animals on the farm have not been given names.\r\n\r\nJackline was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'They offer a reasonable grace period.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: 'They are good for the improvement of farmers.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit this family,' Jackline replied 'it will Improve their livelihood.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jackline owns the following: 'poultry' but does not own 'cow, pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, and automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

She and her husband are helping each other working so they can give their family a good future.\r\n\r\nJocelyn owns a computer shop. These computer shops are rented for Php20.00 per hour. Some families don\u2019t have their own computers so they go to computer shops to encode and print documents. Others rent to connect with their loved ones abroad and others, especially the children and the youth, rent to play games. Normally, computer shops open at 8am and close at 7pm. Her regular customers are the children and youth of their community. She earns Php 4000.00 a month.\r\n\r\nJust as other business owners, she is also hoping that her shop will continue to expand and have more customers and branches. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married with five children between the ages of 4 and 21 years old. Her children are not going to school because she can\u2019t afford money to educate them.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fatmata established her juice and pure water business. She began her business to get a permanent source of income to support herself and her children. She works at the business every day from morning to night. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of financial support to increase her business.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to buy soft drinks, juice and pure water for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate the male children and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to open a shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.04,"image":{"id":1358637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

He is single. He has been a farmer for the past four years. With the loan Anastase wants to pay for the labor costs involved during cleaning of the harvests needed for the sale of the quality products. Anastase will use the profits to reinvest in the same business for the better future of the business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He is married with five children who are all aged between one and fourteen years. He has been a maize farmer for the past 21 years, and his wife is a farmer as well. With the loan, he wants to pay for the labor costs involved during cleaning the harvests to produce quality products for sale. The profits from the business will be used to help set up his family's basic needs. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
