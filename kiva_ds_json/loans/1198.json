Her husband passed away when her child was only one and a half years old. Her daughter stays with her husband\u2019s family and Hevei returned to her parents' house. She is the featured borrower member for Dry-Flower group and she is pictured on the extreme left with her hand raised. Most of the members in their group are divorcees, single or widows. They joined the group to support one another financially and technically. All members live closed to one another in the same region which is about 40 kms far from the main capital town of Imphal, which is one of the capital states in North-Eastern India.\r\n\r\nHevei is a talented weaver and her finished products are highly in demand. She usually receives orders from neighbours and neighbouring villagers. Most of the time she fails to deliver them as she weaves with the traditional backstrap loom. Weaving with the help of the traditional back strap loom is time-consuming and tiring. Hevei generally receives a depository amount from those who placed an order and purchases the yarn and thread from the main market in the city. Once the piece is finished, she gets the full amount.  Her sister also helps her in weaving and both of them generate income for the family. \r\n\r\nThe inability to put aside saving has immensely paralyzed her and made it difficult to efficiently work on her weaving activity. There are times when Hevei does not have enough money to purchase the yarn as most of her income is expended on her nieces and nephews educational fees. Her late brother had left his kids in her responsibility and she tries hard in all possible ways to manage. The demand is high during the wedding season; the bride generally takes several traditional wrap-around skirts along with her. The wedding season starts in the month of October and lasts till late April. \r\n\r\nHevei wants a loan from Kiva to purchase different types of yarn and thread and keep them in stock so as to start weaving before the wedding season begins. She aspires to become the most successful weaver and highest supplier in the town. She says she will work hard and ceaselessly continue striving to get a loom and construct a separate chamber for weaving purposes. The joy is heard when she shares her plans and how she will work in future. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for everything and says \u201cGod Bless Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, or piggery and vegetable selling businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1406448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase more yarn and thread items for weaving different designs so as to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T17:20:37Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T17:20:37Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hevei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinlhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoishi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhotin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-29T13:25:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597906,"name":"Nagina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nagina is a 48-year-old, married woman.

Her business is good enough to lead a decent life. For the improvement of her business, she contacted Kashf foundation and applied for a loan of 30,000 PKR to purchase two more goats.  She is on her fourth loan and has a good repayment history. She hopes to grow her business and dreams of providing a better standard of living for her family members."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.55,"image":{"id":1414289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two more goats.

He runs a wide variety of businesses in the district, including a local grocery shop as well as using his two vehicles to operate a taxi service. He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy an electric maize milling machine and a maize de-huller so that he can provide a milling service to over 2000 members of his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Jonathan\u2019s community grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled and thickened to make what is locally called Nshima. The addition of a maize de-huller creates a further refined flour that is in high demand throughout the region. Jonathan has operated a maize milling machine in the past, so he is well positioned to succeed in this business.\n\nRent-to-Own has done extensive research in Jonathan\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest competitor is 15km away, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. The addition of a maize de-huller is an extra attraction, as those wanting the more refined maize flour will be able to have the processing done in the same place as they have their maize milled. This will also draw customers from neighboring communities.\n\nThe high costs of equipment such as a maize mill and a de-huller are a major barrier, even for successful entrepreneurs like Jonathan. Once he secures a loan, Jonathan will be able to get both a maize mill and a de-huller from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his community, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nWith this maize mill and de-huller, Jonathan will be positioned to offer the only one-stop shop for maize milling in the area. He hopes to hire three employees to help with the day-to-day operation of the equipment. With this combination of equipment and his experience, Jonathan feels that he will be supporting his community with the maize milling service for years to come. This loan will help Jonathan build on his successes as an entrepreneur and build up what will surely be a viable business that can provide for his family throughout the year. It is for this reason Jonathan is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure the maize mill and de-huller as soon as possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1614.26,"image":{"id":1416175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a maize de-huller and a maize milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Katete","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T18:10:05Z","loan_amount":6625,"lender_count":221,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":35500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6100},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":11550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1138.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":475.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2155.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1138.38,"local_amount":6100,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6112.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962083,"comment":null},{"amount":475.88,"local_amount":2550,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-05T17:15:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597895,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha is married with three children, two of whom go to school.

This is his third loan cycle with HOPE Congo, and he is going to use his portion of the loan to purchase prepaid phone cards from a wide variety of networks in Brazzaville, including MTN, Airtel, Warid, and Azur. He has been working in prepaid card sales since 2007 and has learned that he must help his customers use the cards properly to reload their phones and recharge their credit. Customers must pay close attention to entering the recharge codes, or they may become frustrated with his product.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Gildas hopes to move from just selling cards without a fixed location to having a small boutique for more stability in his work.

From a young age she has worked in agriculture and has leveraged her income over the years to buy a house, a tractor, a parcel of land for farming and a small truck for her family. She presently grows potatoes, corn and other crops on a small scale, but she needs more help tending and harvesting her crops these days, as she is weaker than she has been.

","en":"Sairakan is a 64-year-old widow.  After her husband died she brought up three children by herself and managed her farm.  She has a high school education.  In order to bring in income for the family she raises livestock, having started out 43 years ago with the purchase of a cow for 2000KGS.   Thanks to her persistent hard work, Sairakan currently has a milk cow and 22 head of small livestock  on her farm.  She also has a 4-hectare plot of land on which she grows safflower and beans every year.  Her monthly income is 8000KGS.  \r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her farm, Sairakan has turned to the Bai Tushum and Partners microfinance bank for a loan of 50,000KGS to buy a cow to increase her herd.  She plans to use income from the loan to continue to grow the herd and to save up to improve her house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":310.61,"image":{"id":1415115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aral village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sairakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3540},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3643},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3749},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3859},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3971},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4087},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4206},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4329},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4455},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4585},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4719},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4857}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.34,"local_amount":3540,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3604.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014117,"comment":null},{"amount":76.5,"local_amount":3643,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3709.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777181,"comment":null},{"amount":78.73,"local_amount":3749,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3817.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427016,"comment":null},{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":3859,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3929.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942577,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T18:17:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599895,"name":"Las Bellezas De Tarumandy Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las Bellezas de tarumandy es un grupo que est\u00e1 empezando con mucho entusiasmo a trabajar juntas y luchar por crecer, no solo en lo econ\u00f3mico, sino tambi\u00e9n como personas.

They produce wine with the grapes and sell it locally.\r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses, Ekaterine requested a loan from Credo to start up a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides for business start-ups and re-start-ups. It has credits with soft conditions for the country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ekaterine will purchase a milk cow which she will house in an old, empty farm building located in the yard. Ekaterine will work hard on the farm and will sell milk in the village. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family.

Salamat has specialized secondary education. The neighbors speak of her as a diligent and responsible woman. Her husband and children help her with her business. The family is very friendly, and their relationship is very good. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for the family, Salamat has worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1994, after having started this business with 10,000 som (KGS). She has long experience with breeding and keeping livestock. Thanks to Salamat's persistent work, she currently has two dairy cows, 20 sheep, two heifers and one horse on her farm. She also has a plot of land of 3.72 hectares, on which she grows beans and perennial grasses. Her agricultural business brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis for covering the family's food and household expenses. The income from the farm has allowed Salamat to raise and equip the children, and also to improve their living standard.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Salamat turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows. Salamat plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and also, she intends to save up money to, in the future, pay for higher education for her grandchildren."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":518.75,"image":{"id":1415148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Yintymak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-26T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-25T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salamat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":518.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":830}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":518.75,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25151.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942579,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T16:40:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597188,"name":"Matauaina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matauaina is a 31-year-old woman who is married with four children.

She is a mother of six children and is motivated to provide her family with good quality food, clothing, and health expenses.\r\n\r\nNazia wants to grow the business of her husband, so she requested a loan from Kiva's field partner's BRAC Pakistan so that her husband could buy more stock of rice, sugar, cooking oil, detergent, soap and biscuits. She is an honest and regular client of BRAC Pakistan. She is in her third loan cycle with good repayment history. She is expecting a boost in her earnings and dreams of expanding the business further in the future.

a 56-year-old married mother of three children who are between 21 and 24 years, has been growing rice for 20 years. She has requested a loan to buy fertilizers for use in rice growing. The profits from the business will help to provide food for the family and other basic necessities for a better future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Murod's starting capital amounts to 670 Tajik somoni, and he is requesting a loan to buy four steers and calves.

is 43 years old, unmarried, and lives in Nimba County in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second more populous area in Liberia.\r\n \r\nMargaret has a shop which has been selling tea and cold water for the past two years.  She works at her business spending 9 hours.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is too little merchandise in her shop.  \r\n\r\nMargaret went to school and finished grade 12.  Her fiancee is working with youth and sports.  She has five children between 8 and 27 years old. Only two live at home and attend school. \r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from the loan she wants to buy more Lipton's tea and water by the sack.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  She is proud of her business because she gets money every day for her expenses.\r\n  \r\nMargaret wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

","en":"Urumkan is 52 years old, married, and the mother of two children (one daughter and one son).  She has a secondary-specialized education.  Her children both work in Russia and financially support her and her husband, sending them money every month.  Urumkan's husband also actively helps her run her business.\r\n\r\nUrumkan has been involved in agriculture, crop farming and animal husbandry, since 1993, providing her family with its main source of income.  Having started in this business with an initial capital of 1,500 som (KGS), she now makes a monthly income of 8,000 som (KGS) from farming.

The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. He has been driving a truck at a transportation service company since 2011. His wife is a nurse at a hospital. Recently, he purchased a container and transformed it into a house by carving out a window frame and door.

Battsengel, 44 years old, lives with her husband, daughter and niece in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family is currently living in a garage because their house roof and wall is so fragile. She has been mending shoes for a living for about 10 years. Even though her husband's leg is paralyzed, he helps his wife in many ways. Her daughter works at a land register company. As winter is approaching, she wants to renovate her old house because living in the garage in winter is impossible. So she is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as shingles, cement, bricks, planks, fiberglass and foam as well as vacuum insulated windows and hardwood flooring.

Thanks to Kanykey's hard work, she has been able to develop and expand her business, and her activities bring in about 15,000 KGS per month, which is the main source of payment for her family's groceries and other everyday needs. \r\n\r\nProfits from Kanykey's business have allowed her to broaden her turnover of inventory. With the goal of further development of her business, Kanykey has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase wholesale food products for further resale.

Munkhtsetseg, 27 years old, lives with her husband, son and parents in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. They all live in a small wooden house on a plot of land. She has been working as a cashier at a supermarket for two years. \r\n\r\nRecently, she and her husband began building a house next to their old house. But due to lack of finances, she can't afford to buy the necessary building materials such as bricks, cement, shingles, windows, doors and hardwood floors. If she finishes building her house before winter, her parents and her family can live in a comfortable and warm place respectively.

He lives in his own house with his wife and the two youngest children. Fernando's main activity is running a mechanic's workshop where he offers all types of repair for motorcycle, motorcycle taxis, bicycles, and other vehicles. His establishment is located in his house and he has worked there in the afternoon for 5 years with the help of a nephew who is in charge of the technical work. On the other hand, he has been buying and selling wood for 10 years. He does this work mornings with three workers. He buys wood every 10 days or two weeks. He is very happy because both activities are giving him good results thanks to the good clientele he has been able to earn over time. He hopes to keep working as he is now so that in the future he is able to set up a carpenter's workshop or sell wood regionally. This is his first loan with Kiva and he feels grateful for the financial support that he is getting to keep going forward. In addition, he is also committed to making his payments on time. With the amount of  S\/.800 soles he has asked for, he will buy tools to use in his workshop.

Munkhchimeg, 47 years old, lives with her son and grandson in Darkhan, second largest city of Mongolia. The family resides in old house on a plot of land. She has been working as a train movement regulator at a train station for twenty-eight years.

is 35 years old. He is a graphic designer from the Akhaltsikhe district. He is married and lives with his wife, mother-in-law and four children (1, 8, 9 and 11 years old). Imeda is the only one who makes money in his household. He has rented a place in his district and is actively involved in the graphic arts industry. Imeda works on special orders and creates visual concepts of furniture, billboards, cars, architecture, etc., using computer software.  \r\n\r\nHe works hard and the business is going well, but his earnings are not enough for such a large family. For this reason, Imeda decided to diversify the business and requested credit from MFO Credo to purchase souvenirs and jewelry for selling.

Joyce works from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm daily with the ability to earn a fair profit per month. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania, which she will use to restock the missing items in her retail shop. Joyce dreams that one day she will be able to own a big business. \r\n\r\nShe will share this loan with her loan group \"Muheza\", which consists of four members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.

He is the father of their two dependent children, who live with them in the house that they own. \r\n\r\nDiana earns her living selling regional foods. Every morning, she sets up her table in front of her parents' house and sells all the dishes that she has carefully prepared. She also sells various cold drinks made with local fruits. She serves her customers very courteously; the majority of them are her own neighbors. They recommend her to other people who then, with time, become regular customers. She began three years ago, initially selling very little, but with the passage of time she has gradually increased the quantity of servings in accordance with customer demand. So far, she has worked alone with the occasional help of her sister.

He is married and thefather of one daughter.\r\n\r\nMasallah has raised vegetables like potato, carrot, and pumpkins in his garden for the last 6 years. He also breeds cattle for meat purposes. Both businesses bring him a stable income of 250 AZN. However, there is a problem which prevents growing his business - a shortage of water resources for animals and for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThere are still some utility problems with the water supply in his region. People are suffering and he has to order special cars with water to irrigate his crops, especially in summertime, when the temperature reaches 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nBuilding a water channel requires a lot of expense and is an expensive process which requires labor force and special equipment.

is 36 years old, married and living in the village of Dzimiti with her husband and school-aged daughter.

The harvest is sold at the local market. \r\n\r\nBesides this, Guliko runs a dairy farm with a cow for milk. She produces dairy products with the milk and sells them from her house. As their existing income is very small and is not enough to cover everyday expenses, Guliko decided to start a clothing sales business. She requested a loan from the local credit providers, but they usually demand some stable income from the borrowers. Guliko\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She received this credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 2,000 GEL she will purchase clothing and household items at wholesale prices and sell them in her community door-to-door. She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children and bedclothes as well. It is obvious that the job is hard for Guliko, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her business gradually. The Start Up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased thanks to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1415240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to start a clothing trading business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Dzimiti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-27T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-26T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guliko ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92.43},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":106.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":105.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":109.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":131.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":134.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":138.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1225,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134355,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T06:14:22Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T16:20:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599580,"name":"Danaya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe DANAYA, compos\u00e9 de femmes mari\u00e9es, ont en moyenne 37 ans, 5 enfants et vivent toutes dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies dans le village de Sanakorodjeda commune de Banco, pr\u00e9fecture de Dioila, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro (deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nElles se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de parent\u00e9, de voisinage et d\u2019amiti\u00e9.
