He has more than 10 years experience doing this work. At times he buys wood lots to cut down the trees and then sell the lumber. At other times, when he doesn't have capital available he just gets paid for the labor. In addition, and to supplement his income, he grows coffee. He collects the harvest and sells it in the plaza of the regional market. In this way he has enough resources to pay for his household expenses. His drive, tenacity and his constant fight have allowed him to get ahead, meeting the goals he sets for himself. That is why he is asking for the help of the loan. With it, he wants to buy a wood lot to cut it down and sell the lumber he harvests. This will be reflected in an increase of income which for him means more wellbeing for his family, even knowing the risks he faces doing this work. Boris dreams of being able to plant trees so in the future he can cut his own wood and in that way improve his financial resources so he can offer a better quality of life to his loved ones.

Profits from her business will definitely help sustain her family's daily needs and her children's education. She looks forward to this additional income with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEufemia hopes to buy another unit of Jeepney and dreams to give her children a good life and education. She meets with her co-fellowship members** every week to share stories of her work and to find strength and encouragement from the word of God, which she studies.\r\n\r\n* Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney. It is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

To cover their expenses, they are also engaged in breeding  livestock--cows and hens--and cultivating apricots, apples, pears and walnuts. In the present,it is very difficult for the family to fully cover their needs. This is why Arshaluys wants to increase their livestock a little bit. She needs a loan of USD 2100 to purchase two steers and forage for them. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Arshaluys was able to organize her farming in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Arshaluys and her husband rely on the good will of the lenders and will be thankful to them for helping them sustain their lives.

I like that I can choose additional courses there at AUCA. I will be able to take economics courses that I think will be helpful later on in business and some psychology courses that are in my opinion generally needed in life.\r\n\r\n\"AUCA gives many interesting and unique opportunities to its students and one of them is financial aid that is open to all its students.

is an experienced farmer from Getap village of Vayots Dzor village. He lives with his wife and son. Gagik earns a living for his family through renovating cars. Gagik's son works in the private sector. The two of them are the only breadwinners of the family. As it is hardly possible to meet the family's needs based on their salaries, Gagik and his family are involved in cattle breeding and agriculture, and in cultivation of apricots, cherries, apples, pears, and walnuts. They realize the agricultural products in the local market. To be able to continue his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Gagik needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase calves and to buy some forage for cattle. He has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Gagik was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Gagik and his family will be thankful to all the lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1461963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves and to buy some forage for cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Getap village of Vayots Dzor region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gagik","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":115.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":118.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":126.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":128.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130.49},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":131.38},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":136.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.93},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.21},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.49},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.38},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.08},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439846014,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-22T01:35:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627069,"name":"Shpresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shpresa, whose name in English means Hope, is married and has three children.

To be able to cover her family's daily expenses, Varsik is engaged in breeding a livestock of cows, pigs, hens, and in the cultivation of peaches, apricots, apples, pears and walnuts. Her husband helps her greatly in realizing the agricultural products in the local market. In order for her agribusiness to function in a sustainable way and to be more productive, Varsik needs a loan of USD 2800 to purchase a steer and five piglets. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back. However, thanks to hard work during the recent times, Varsik was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

He realizes income from selling the agricultural products in the local market.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn is progressing, Robert needs to make some investments in his agribusiness. A loan of USD 1000 will support him greatly, enabling him to purchase forage for the livestock. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to the hard work during more recent times, Robert has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So he has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

Benjamin is a friendly 73-year-old member of the community, and he has 12 children. Benjamin lives with his family in a house with concrete walls, sand or dirt floor, and an iron roof. He is a subsistence peasant farmer, his primary crops being maize and cassava. He actively participates in community prayer groups. \n\nIvola village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Benjamin and the 15 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBenjamin has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Benjamin volunteered to be the promoter because, in his own words, \"I love my people!\" He wants to help the community by killing germs in drinking water and improving health. There are also three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Phoebe, Josephat, and Florence.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Benjamin\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.

As life is getting more expensive with time, Mikhail wants to expand his agribusiness to be able to effectively meet his family's needs.

However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Mikhail was able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments.

He is 32 years old and lives with his family, which includes 6 children aged 1 to 16. The community of Musembe village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Musembe\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Musembe, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Kennedy has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Prisca, Florence, Dorcas and Hestone.\n\nMusembe village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Kennedy believes that the dispenser will remove germs and improve community health.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Kapchorwa\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Kapchorwa, 35 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mary, a subsistence farmer of maize and cattle, has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

In addition to using his business for selling to customers, he also uses it to help older families so they don't have to go to the market in the city. He attempts, as much as possible, to provide for his customers' needs himself. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ahmed would like to expand his business, but the wholesalers hesitate to provide him with the required goods, dealing with him as a lower-class person.

Mary and other promoters in her community (including Faith, Amiani, Francis and Wyckliffe) need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Mary will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Mary wants to be a promoter because she is hard-working. Mary believes that the dispenser will chlorine will kill germs and help her community stay healthier.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Jedereria\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Jedereria, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Paul has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy.

She is 51 years old, works as a commercial farmer, and has 6 children aged 9 to 21 years old. The community of Bushugunga\/Chamagoti village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Bushugunga\/Chamagoti\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Bushugunga\/Chamagoti, 15 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Grace has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Hellen, Barnaba, John and Laban.\n\nBushugunga\/Chamagoti village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Grace believes that the dispenser will prevent water-borne diseases, thus helping people to maintain good health and work without sickness. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Grace\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1463477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-05T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-04T23:30:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barnaba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-13T09:34:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628102,"name":"Phanice's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phanice, a a friendly, reliable and well-liked resident of Gimarakwa village, Kenya, has volunteered to be the community promoter for a new chlorine dispenser. \n\nGimarakwa village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring.

She is 44 years old, makes her living as a subsistence peasant maize farmer, and has 5 children aged 15 to 22. The community of Maganda village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Maganda\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Maganda, 25 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Hellen has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Florence, Mary, Samson and Joash.\n\nMaganda village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.

The community of Sugura A village collects their drinking water from an unprotected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Sugura A\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Sugura A, 30 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Mark has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Eunice, Elizabeth and Hellen.\n\nSugura A village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Mark believes that the chlorine kills germs in the water, which makes it safe to drink. He believes the dispenser will therefore prevent waterborne diseases and allow community members to have good health and be successful in life.

The community of Jidereria A village collects their drinking water from a protected spring because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Jidereria A\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Jidereria A, 40 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water. Agnes has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, who is responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are three other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Patrick, Evans and Josphine.\n\nJidereria A village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Agnes believes that the dispenser will kill bugs and prevent waterborne diseases.

He has been involved in farming for four years. On his farm he has cows and poultry and grows crops, especially maize. His main source of income is the sale of milk, eggs, and crops, and he also has a personal business. He enjoys the good returns he gets out of farming, while his biggest challenges are the diseases that affect the crops and livestock.\r\n\r\nJames chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of their low interest rate.

His business was initially begun with limited capital that didn`t allow it to run well to get more profit. Many people prefer his store because he always has the basic staples at accessible prices, and he provides the best possible customer service. His dream is to see his store flourish.

She lives with her two sons in the Hamadoni district of Tajikistan and has experienced both happiness and sorrow in her life.  A few years ago, Rajabi divorced from her husband and was left alone to raise and provide for her two children.  Before her divorce, she used to sell children's clothes on the street and also went to other districts and villages to sell her merchandise. \r\n\r\nRajabi's children are getting older -- they are now 14 and 10 years old.

She lives in the company of her husband with whom she has a daughter: Juana, who she cares for in the house that she inherited 25 years ago. A few years ago she opened a grocery store on the outskirts of the city. This idea went very well so she started selling and gaining many customers. That's how she got the idea to expand her business and improve it by opening a restaurant, besides food she would be able to sell cold drinks since the heat of the jungle is strong. Now she has a complete space where the majority of profits are earned on weekends and holidays when visitors come from the interior of the country, as well as foreign tourists. Her project is to buy a bigger lot to be able to offer other tourist activities. She belongs to the communal bank \"La Brisas,\" and this is the third loan with KIVA. She is happy to continue working with the members of her communal bank who are very supportive, welcoming, and responsible.
