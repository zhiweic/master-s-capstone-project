Gregorio uses hazardous lighting sources like candles and diesel lamps to peal and clean coffee beans and then to bag mature coffee into a costal ( a type of sack). Because coffee prices have decreased, Gregorio has to be more productive, and a solar home system will allow him to do so. For Gregorio, the education is also very important, so having a clean lighting source will allow his children to study for more hours during the nighttime. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":413.33,"image":{"id":1341267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"buy a solar home system that will increase his coffee production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Colonia Modelo, Zongolica, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":275,"posted_date":"2013-04-27T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-27T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosendo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373512618,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1215.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390980404,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":607.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399835826,"comment":null},{"amount":163.33,"local_amount":1960,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1986.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419876110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-27T04:39:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554080,"name":"Zongolica A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonardo, Mario and Maria Diega live in Aguaje Chico, a small indigenous community that is 1.5 hours away from the nearest rural town through a complicated road.

These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, George will open a shop that specializes in headstones. \r\n\r\nAs George already has a commercial space, he will economize on renting expenses.

is 45-year-old Hawa. She is married and has three children aged seven, twelve and 23. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her to help with the house chores. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Hawa established her provision, toiletries, drinks and African-dress business. She began her business because she wants to help her retired husband to run the affairs of the home. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are adults of all sexes. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,589,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,500,000. Hawa has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional mayonnaise, powdered milk and laundry soap.

However, for this new loan cycle, there are two additional members bringing the total to eleven business women. Their average age is 34 years and each has an average of four children. The capital from the new loan cycle will be used to boost the productivity of their businesses which will not only be valuable to them but also to their families and the community.\r\n\r\nIn the first loan cycle, we reported about a young 25-year-old woman named Olivia.

Olivia is eagerly awaiting another micro loan!\r\n\r\nBrenda is an 18-year-old single mother of a beautiful daughter who is 14 months old. She was only able to attend school until the 7th grade as she had to take care of her daughter and needed to work to support herself and her daughter. In thinking of the future of her baby girl, she thought carefully about what she wanted to pursue and decided to begin to sell fruit. She works seven days per week and happily, the business is growing and doing well. Brenda wants to inject more capital into her business and for that reason; she is applying for her first loan from Friendship Bridge. She looks forward to purchasing more fruit and increasing her inventory.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank \u201cShalom\u201d appreciates the confidence and support of KIVA investors not only for this second loan but also for the previous one.

who appears in the photo, is a 29-year-old married young man and a father to two sons and two daughters. Saeed is employed in a local university and earns small salary, which is almost enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nSaeed is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help him cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture and bedroom furniture in order to improve living conditions in his house. Taking this loan will offer Saeed and his family comfortable furniture so they can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

This is her eighth loan, which she will use to improve her house. She has had her business for over seven years, having started it with her own savings. Her latest loan was invested in the business, where she sells decoration items.\r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house, at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nJoaquina wants to start building her house with this loan. She is needing to improve her house condition, since they are living in a deteriorated home structure, and she is taking this loan for that purpose. So now she is requesting this loan to buy cement and concrete blocks to start building her house walls. \r\n\r\nJoaquina wishes to have a safe and nice home, also to have a vocational school to teach people to decorate and make crafts.

She lives in Vanadzor city with her son who is a student at the Armenian State Economical University. Rita has a higher education but has never worked in her specialty. She brought up her son alone and that period coincided with the Soviet Union's collapse in Armenia. It was a most difficult period in Rita\u2019s life. There was no gas, water or flour for bread and Armenia was under an economic blockade. Rita was jobless but she overcame that period heroically. \r\n\r\nRita decided to run her own production business. She started to produce traditional Armenian meat products: basturma and sujukh (Armenian special sausages). In production Rita uses only fresh meat which she purchases on the wholesale markets of Vanadzor city.  The special preparation techniques and secrets of basturma and sujukh Rita has learned from her grandmother. Rita's meat products are very famous and popular in Vanadzor city and Lori area. \r\n\r\nAfter 20 years she has a large number of customers who prefer to buy meat products from Rita, because they have a unique taste and aroma. The meat production income allows Rita to meet her little family's needs and to pay for her son\u2019s education. Rita is asking for a loan of 1,000,000 Armenian drams from Kiva lenders in order to buy a large quantity of beef for her meat production.

This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Anie's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Anie is requesting a loan of PHP 15, 000. She will use the loan to buy more raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nAnie dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

It is hardly enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLaura has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLaura requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Laura has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Laura will rent a counter and begin a jewelry trade. She plans to purchase different kinds of jewelry and gold products for resale. As her husband is involved in the jewelry business, she hopes that it will be profitable.

The lady sitting in the front with a raised hand is Pira. She lives with her six-member family comprised of her husband; four sons, ages 30, 28, 25 and 20; and one daughter, age 22. She is a very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic person who always devotes her time to getting her family ahead.\r\n\r\nPira herself has been running a general grocery shop for nine years to maintain her family. Initially, she started the business with a low profile selling limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Apart from this, her two sons have two barber shops and the other two sons are working at other barber shops on a daily wage basis.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2010, Pira and three other women of her locality formed a joint liability group named <i>Jai Durga<\/i> and took out a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. This is the second loan for her group.\r\n\r\nWith the first loans, Pira has been able to add some grocery items like dough, oil, spices, etc. Now she is earning 300 Indian rupees daily from her business \u2013 which is very scanty to manage her big family.

All members hail from a poor background in the \"below poverty line\" category. This is the third loan for her group.\r\n\r\nWith the last three loans, Premlata has been able to add some grocery items like dough, vegetables, oil and spices. Every day from the early morning, she starts her work for a stretch of ten hours. Now she is earning 500 Indian rupees daily from her business \u2013 which is not sufficient for her to manage the business. Premlata is planning to diversify her business by adding some daily needs food items. So, with the present loan, she has planned to buy biscuits, mixture, cake, bread, cold drinks, etc., in bulk. She also wants to purchase a refrigerator for storing the food items. She expects to increase her sales and income, which will serve to ensure the education and welfare of her children. Premlata hopes to build a house and get her children married into respectable families.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group; Sasmita, Kumudini, Rohini and Soudamini, are running a betel nut shop, running a restaurant, selling vegetables wholesale and running a cloth store business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1338253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for purchasing biscuits, cake, bread, cold drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-27T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-27T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soudamini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumudini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rohini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premlata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":136000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":136000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-01T23:12:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552204,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is a married woman with three children, who all attend school.

In the meeting the usefulness of the cook stove--less smoke, fuel saving, less fuel cost up to 50% and time saving points--were discussed which impressed people. To get this loan Sebati formed a Joint Liability Group named Maha Laxmi, taking three other like-minded women of her village  as members. \r\n\r\nFrom this loan Sebati is planning to purchase a cook stove which costs Rs.2400\/- .

It totals 220 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Irma has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irma will begin a trade in clothing and bedclothes. She plans to purchase clothing and bedclothes in Turkey and then resell them among her villagers at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family.

She sells food products, such as macaronis, butter, cookies, sugar, tea, candies, and beverages in her shop. Bahar has 24 years of experience in this field, which makes her a knowledgeable and skilled person.\r\n\r\nThe food product she sells is very popular among people and in high demand. Her monthly profit from selling food is 120 AZN. She is a very successful entrepreneur because of her good location in the central bazaar of her home city. \r\n\r\nThe profit she gains is not enough to reinvest into the business and covering customers` demands is impossible for this reason.

He lives in the village of Dzevera, Gori district. Paata requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nPaata is an artisan. He is working for private orders in construction and on house renovations to get a small monthly salary. This is the only income for Paata, and it's not enough to cover his monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nPaata requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Paata has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Paata will purchase maize, haricot and tomato seeds and fertilizer. As he already owns an agricultural plot of land, Paata wants to cultivate it and plant all the products. The fertilizer will help him to get a good harvest, which will be sold locally at the markets. Part of the profit will be used in the same field, in order to expand his agricultural business.

He lives in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, with his wife and son. Vazha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nVazha is a hired worker at a local bread factory, making a total of 300 Laris (GEL) per month, which is the only source of income for the family. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nVazha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vazha has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

He lives in the Gardabani District with his wife, sister, retired mother, and two children (three and four years old). Gela requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his family's business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of their low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. They have two milk cows. The cows are milked every day and family makes dairy products, which are sold locally at the markets. Gela\u2019s sister is working at the local shop as a seller and gets a small monthly salary. Additional family income is from Gela\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension.  \r\n\r\nGela requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Gela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Gela will purchase chicks. He already has cages ready and will raise them. After the chicks are grown they will be sold at the local markets, and Gela will earn a good profit. He will reinvest part of the profit in the same business, in order to develop their poultry, and he will use another part for the family's well-being. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1338451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gardabani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-27T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-27T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gela ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":126.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":135.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":138.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":139.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":143.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":148.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":155.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":161.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":168.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.82},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.6,"local_amount":87.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":87.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749622,"comment":null},{"amount":2912.4,"local_amount":2912.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2912.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T04:56:09Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552352,"name":"Charlotte","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlotte is married and has two children.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University. He has 4 children and has been a farmer for 8 years.  His primary income sources are milk and egg sales and crops.\r\nHe likes tending to his cows but finds it difficult when there is a drought in the area.\r\n\r\nHe requested a loan of KES.50,000 from Juhudi Kilimo for purchasing a dairy cow. Paul was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, and he said because they are efficient. During the training course with Juhudi Kilimo, he learned how to keep records for his business.\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees.

is 41-year-old Mariatu. She is married and has two children, aged 18 and 22. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her and works as a sales assistant in her business. In 2005, Mariatu established her building materials business. She began her business because she wanted to assist her husband in their home affairs.

This is because they have completely repaid their sixth loan with Friendship Bridge, which was their first loan funded through Kiva. Because of their previous loans, several women have been able to grow their businesses, which has enabled them to progress toward their goals in life. The ladies live in Juchanep, Totonicpan, and have been longtime neighbors and friends. Their average age is 39 years, and the average number of children in each household is three.\r\n\r\nArcoiris Group is requesting a second loan funded by Kiva. The funds from this loan will be invested mainly in businesses related to textile production (including weaving, hand embroidery and making aprons), as well as in selling vegetables and produce.\r\n\r\nPaulina, a founding member of Arcoiris Group, is someone who has been described in previous reports. She is a 36-year-old woman who has only a second grade education. She has four children. Along with her family, Paulina works in the textile industry. She used her previous loan to buy yarn, in order to increase production. She was able to successfully pay off that loan and looks forward to the next one. Presently, Paulina\u2019s business is doing well, and she is happy to report that she still employs three members of her community. Because of her previous loan, she was able to take orders which proved profitable, especially before the Easter holiday.\r\n\r\nPaulina is currently applying for an additional loan, which she will invest in the purchase of various types of fine yarns for her textile business. In addition, she will use her loan for her second revenue stream. Specifically, Paulina raises and sells chickens and intends to use part of her new loan to buy new chicks that she will raise! \r\n\r\nPaulina and the Arcoiris Group trust bank are extremely thankful for these loans, which will help them maintain and increase each of their businesses. They look forward to the future, to providing a good education for their children and improving their lifestyle. As their name suggests, with the loans and education that they are receiving, they are creating the pot of gold under the rainbow!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2553.92,"image":{"id":1338019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to
