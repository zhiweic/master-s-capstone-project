However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw.

She has also been using a big portion of this income to purchase fuel, and after being advised by VEP on how to save this amount of money, she opted for a biodigester to save on her day-to-day fuel costs.

Following  a very difficult emotional situation when her husband left her and having all the financial responsibilities fall on her, she looked for income opportunities to be able to pay her household expenses and has been selling pastries, sweets, cigarettes, and cell phone cards on foot for the past six years.  This has allowed her to provide her family with their basic needs.  She is a very enterprising, friendly, dynamic, and hard working woman who works long shifts Monday  through Sunday so she can take maximum advantage of her stall, since it\u2019s located on a well-travelled main street in the city where she lives.  She is asking for this seventh loan which she will use to fix up her stall, buy stock (pastries, cookies, candy, cigarettes) and pay off the other loan she has.

She also has 1.72 hectares of irrigated land, where she annually plants potatoes, beans and perennial herbs.  Aygul receives an additional income of 4550 som (KGS) from selling milk.  In order to further develop her business, Aygul requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy two cows.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities and also intends to prepare a dowry for her daughter.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":298.73,"image":{"id":1405040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy two cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"May village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3165},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2674},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2752},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2833},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2915},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3088},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3178},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3270},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3366},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3464},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3565},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3669},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3886},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4116},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3283}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.65,"local_amount":5839,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5955.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014081,"comment":null},{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":2752,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2806.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777149,"comment":null},{"amount":59.02,"local_amount":2833,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426975,"comment":null},{"amount":60.73,"local_amount":2915,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2973.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-09T07:18:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594331,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda del Carmen se gradu\u00f3 de t\u00e9cnico en educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica en la universidad sin embargo no ha ejercido la profesi\u00f3n ya que ella tiene que cuidar a sus dos hijos menores y a su mama.

There are also some tiny stores, food vendors and a business selling bubbles. The average age of this group of hard working women is 38 and they have had an average of four years of school. These women are excited to be part of this group since Namaste Guatemaya is the first organization to give them the opportunity to learn how to manage their business and their money in addition to offering microcredit.  \n\nIngrid Yolanda (third from right) is a 37-year-old widow with four children - 3 sons aged 18, 17 and 16 and a daughter aged 12.  Her husband died in an automobile accident when she was pregnant with her daughter.  Her business is selling small bottles of bubble-making solution with wands for blowing bubbles.  She mixes shampoo, a natural glue and water, and bottles it in small bottles.  She also makes the wands out of wire.  She sells these at fairs and fiestas throughout her part of the country.  Bubbles are popular at Guatemalan fairs.  She started this business when she was seven, to bring additional income to her parents.  She continued the business when she was married and now she supports herself and her children with a little help from her oldest son who works as a construction helper.  Her other children help her in her business.  Only her youngest child is still in school.\n\nHer monthly income is 2000 Quetzales (US $256) with a profit of Q1200 (US $153).  With her loan she plans to travel to Guatemala City to buy solutions, bottles and wire in bulk.  Her projected profit with her new business plan and buying in bulk is Q1876 (US $240) which is an increase of 56% and will allow her to better feed her family and perhaps allow one or two of the boys to return to school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":774.32,"image":{"id":1407247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy in bulk the supplies she needs for her business selling bubbles at fairs and fiestas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Miguel Due\u00f1as, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-08-12T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-11T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria De La Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ingrid Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Nohemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lesbia Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":11100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1233.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":319.04,"local_amount":2485.16,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095147,"comment":null},{"amount":158.72,"local_amount":1236.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419860866,"comment":null},{"amount":159.58,"local_amount":1243.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509403,"comment":null},{"amount":136.98,"local_amount":1067.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1075.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733255,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T19:05:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594424,"name":"Elwin Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elwin, est\u00e1 casado vive con su esposa y su hija.

She has a wooden home where she lives with her family. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living in the production and maintenance of agricultural products such as cocoa, barbasco and organic coffee, She has done this for 10 years. She acquired plots of land when she was young, with the father of her children, taking advantage of an offer from a family member. She has the support of local workers who she periodically hires to remove weeds and harvest the crops. She believes that her job is one of the most self-sacrificing and at the same time rewarding, since she gets good results for her products. \r\n\r\nShe is currently starting a new growing season and wants to have enough money to buy organic fertilizer for the land, as well as tools to carry out their work without complications. \r\n\r\nEvery day she gets up very early with the goal to one day purchase a plot of land in the city and build a home for the future well-being of her children. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva and she feels grateful for the financial support she receives to continue forward. Furthermore, she promises to pay her installments in a punctual manner.

She has a specialized secondary education.  She gets very good reviews from her neighbors who describe her as a kind and hardworking woman.\r\n\r\nTamara has been involved in animal husbandry since 1990, thus providing her family with its main source of income.   She started in this business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, she has managed to develop her activity and increase her livestock headcount.

She lives with them in her adobe house. When she turned 23, she started to work on land that her ex-husband had, growing the most profitable products in the area, such as organic cacao and barbasco. She says that at first it wasn't easy at all because she didn't have enough money to buy seeds and organic fertilizer, things that are necessary to  obtain a good quality fruit. Right now, she has 3 hectares of crops where she grows barbasco, since the soil on her land is favorable for obtaining a good quality of that products.  To harvest and latter sell the roots, she hires laborers from the area who very carefully dig up the stalks and wrap them in cords made from tree bark so they can be transported to the sales centers without losing their properties. They are used to make natural insecticide and for other commercial purposes. This is her first Kiva loan and she is grateful for the financial support she is getting to keep going ahead.

She is aiming to grow her business and increase her profits so that she may continue assisting her husband with providing the family income. \nThe story of Shawnm and her business is just one of the many examples of Izdiharona for Economic Development's clients who have been able to improve their business with a small business loan product, specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses where a relatively small amount of capital can provide significant business improvement.\n\nShe asked to blur her face because she is from a rural area and preferred to have her face altered for cultural reasons. \n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1405199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"A loan of $1,800 helped Shawnm to buy new sewing machine and fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":321,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shawnm","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T13:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399840207,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410115450,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880207,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429528827,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439752986,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T12:58:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592512,"name":"Ngigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngigi is 32 years old.

meet 44-year-old Janet. She is from Buchanan, which is the capital city of Grand Bassa County and is located by the sea.  It is well-known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.  Unfortunately, Janet was not able to attend school. She is married with six children between the ages of four and 23. Three of her children live at home and attend school. Janet describes herself as a hardworking woman.  For the past seven years, she has run a shop where she sells fashionable clothes. She started her business with money from her mother and transports her goods by taxi. Janet works five hours a day seven days a week and her major business challenge is to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nJanet is requesting a loan to buy fashion clothes to sell.  She is proud of her business because of the profit she makes. In the future, Janet plans to educate all her children.  She thanks you in advanced for your

39-year-old Eleanor from Kandeh town in Sierra Leone. She is married with three children between the ages of two and 10. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2008, Eleanor established her wood business. She began her business because she needed to create a source of income to support her home. Eleanor works 10 hours per day and seven days per week.  She says that her business is doing well because she is able to use her profit to have her daily meal.  \r\n\r\nEleanor is requesting a loan to purchase wood to resell. She hopes that the extra income from her loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Eleanor plans to open a grocery shop. She thanks you for your

She lives with her common law partner. For the past 13 years she has run a business, that her father-in-law left her as an inheritance, a bar that offers soft drinks, beer, coffee, pastries and other products. The business has been in existence for 50 years, so it is well known in the area it is located in. \r\n\r\nOlga learned this business by working in it and with the help of her husband and an employee has been able to maintain it. But due to financial difficulties she has not been able to invest money to make the business grow, since up to now she has only made enough to support her household. So she is requesting this loan to expand and fix-up the business and to buy stock (soft drinks, coffee, beer, pastries). Doing this she can improve the image of the business which will change the customers perception of it. She will also have a variety of products to offer, which will be reflected by higher sales and in the end, greater profits. \r\n\r\nShe can also advance towards the accomplishment of her main goal, which is to expand her business, stock it well, and in the short term install a few billiard tables to increase the influx of clients. With which she can enjoy more economic stability, provide better education for her children and enjoy a higher standard of living for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1408545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to expand and fix up her business and buy stock (soft drinks, coffee, beer, pastries)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Liborina","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga Luc\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":120058},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123345},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126722},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":130191},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133755},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":137417},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":141179},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":145044},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":149015},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":153095},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":157286},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":161592},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166016},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170561},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":175230},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":180028},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":184956},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":190020},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":195222},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200567},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":206058},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":211699},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":217494},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.13},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.75},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.79},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":132.73,"local_amount":246941,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":249198.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807367,"comment":null},{"amount":66.05,"local_amount":122885,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":124008.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095457,"comment":null},{"amount":1951.22,"local_amount":3630174,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3663365.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074519,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T20:37:38Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:53:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592668,"name":"Mark Donnel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mark Donnel is married, 32 years old, and lives with his wife in Lapasan, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.\r\n\r\nMark Donnel is operating a service-based business, providing motor rental and transportation services in the local community to earn a living while his wife works in a private company.

All of the children live with their mother.  After the death of her husband, the family's provider, Sozul became involved in farming and animal husbandry in 1986 in order to find income for her family.  She started the business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard labor and diligent work, Sozul achieved some successes in developing her business and started to earn a monthly profit in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS).  Today Sozul's farm contains three dairy cows, one calf, one horse and fifty sheep.  Her family is very friendly, and all of the children help the mother with the business.

She also has a small plot of land, where she grows tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, cabbage and potatoes - for own consumption and for selling. \r\n\r\nGualyim's husband works with road maintenance management, doing piecework. Two of the sons help with the farm. The eldest son lives in the capital of Kyrgyzstan. He works in a bank and helps the family financially, sending his monthly income to them. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulayim turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a cow. Gulayim plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her small business, and she also plans to open a small vegetable store in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":448.44,"image":{"id":1405652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Konorchok","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T20:20:05Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulayim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4375},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.38,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8784.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014085,"comment":null},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4392.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777153,"comment":null},{"amount":89.69,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4392.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426979,"comment":null},{"amount":89.69,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4392.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942552,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T03:07:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594865,"name":"Luz Dary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de dos hijos y es separada.

","en":"Zarakhan is 54 years old, married, and has two children (one son and one daughter). Zarakhan has secondary education. As a person she is hard working, and has an optimistic view on life. \r\n\r\nAs a main income for her family, Zarakhan has been working with selling men's and women's clothing since 1995, after having started this business with 3,000 som (KGS). She has a rented retail space at the central market. Her husband helps with the business. He brings goods from wholesale markets, while Zarakhan sells them as retail goods. \r\n\r\nThanks to Zarakhan and her husband's persistent and coordinated work, they have been able to develop and broaden their assortment of goods. Zarakhan's business brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month, which serves as the basis to cover the family's food expenses and household needs. The income from the business allowed Zarakhan to increase her turnover. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zarakhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase men's and women's clothing for reselling. The income from the loan will help Zarakhan increase her turnover and the income received also helps her pay for her son's tuition for education under good conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":395.81,"image":{"id":1405679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothes for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Buzhum village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T20:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T20:30:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4026},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3657},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3764},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3874},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3987},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4103},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4222},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4346},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4472},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4603},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4737},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4209}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":157.5,"local_amount":7683,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":7713.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014086,"comment":null},{"amount":77.16,"local_amount":3764,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3778.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777154,"comment":null},{"amount":79.42,"local_amount":3874,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3889.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426980,"comment":null},{"amount":81.73,"local_amount":3987,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4002.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T18:26:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592736,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is widowed and has three children, two are in school and one is an adult.

Raikhan has a higher education and is well respected by her neighbors.  They say that she is a kind and hardworking woman.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Raikhan has been involved in selling food products since 2004, having started this business with 20,000 som (KGS).  She leases her store and sells food products there.  Thanks to her hard work, Raikhan was able to grow her business and expand the merchandise selection.  Her business yields about 40,000 som (KGS) per month, serving as a base for covering family expenses for food and needs.  The income from the business allowed Raikhan to increase her product turnover.  In order to further develop her business, Raikhan requested a loan in the amount of 122,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy food products wholesale for future resale.  The earnings from the loan will help Raikhan to increase product turnover at the food market, and the resulting profit will help her to raise and educate her children in good conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":608.69,"image":{"id":1405532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products wholesale for future resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzylkiya town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T20:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T20:40:01Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raikhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":122000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6463},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5593},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5736},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5881},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6031},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6184},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6341},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6502},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6668},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6837},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7011},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7189},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7372},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7559},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7751},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7948},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8150},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6784}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.87},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":247.05,"local_amount":12056,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":12094.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014083,"comment":null},{"amount":117.54,"local_amount":5736,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5754.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777151,"comment":null},{"amount":120.51,"local_amount":5881,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5899.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426977,"comment":null},{"amount":123.59,"local_amount":6031,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6050.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942551,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T18:06:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593516,"name":"Harisu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harisu is a 40 year old father, maize farmer and a Babban Gona member in the Marmara Village of Kaduna.

Her daughter is a student, one son works in Russia, and the other son is a school student.  Elmira has a secondary-specialized education.  She is calm, responsible, happy and hardworking.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Elmira has been involved in an agricultural business - fattening up livestock and growing agricultural crops - since 1987.  She grows strawberries.  She started this business with 800 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, Elmira's business contains two dairy cows, one bull, three sheep, and also has a land plot of 1.16 hectares, where she grows sainfoin and wheat.  Her business yields about 8,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk, strawberries, which serves as a base for covering her family's expenses for food and needs.  Money transfers from Russia, where Elmira's son works, comprise additional income.  The income from the business allowed Elmira to educate her daughter at a university.  In order to further develop her business, Elmira requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls for subsequent fattening up and resale.  The earnings from the loan will help Elmira to grow her business and also to update furniture at home in the

He is excited about the opportunities Babban Gona provides him to grow his farm and looks forward to when his family members are all so happy to have enough healthy food to eat, with the support provided by Babban Gona.  Like all Babban Gona members, Ishaku has the opportunity to double his income and yield this season; he can expect to earn $1,350\/ha, twice the average Nigerian farmer's yearly income.

She has a secondary education.  She has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - since 2007, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  Her youngest son helps her with the business.  Thanks to Darikha's hard work, today she has a good buisness, containing one dairy cow, two calves, eighteen sheep and elevel goats.  She also has a land plot of 1.40 hectares, where she grows hay and feed for the livestock.  The profits allowed Darikha to increase livestock on her farm and, thus, improve her family's welfare.  In order to further develop her business, Darikha requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for subsequent fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan in further increasing the livestock quantities and also plans to marry off her youngest son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1405563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock for subsequent fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tendik village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-13T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-12T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darikha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":516.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":516.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T20:04:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":592752,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 25000 through NWTF to buy items to sell like soap, milk, sugar, canned goods, eggs, noodles, etc. for her general store business.\r\n\r\nSusan has been in this business for 6 years.

Carmen works in agriculture.  She rises very early in the morning to head out to her farmland that\u2019s been producing organic cacao beans for 11 years thus being able to support her family economically.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s always on top of any expenses her children might generate especially during the school term which is why she\u2019s always watchful of her cacao and coca leaf production.  She sells her crops to various merchants who offer her good per kilo profits.  With profits earned from her ha rests she\u2019s able to cover her children\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nShe considers her work to be quite self-sacrificing because it\u2019s her only source of income.  She always gets support from local laborers with whom she keeps her crops in good condition hoping to produce good condition cacao stalks every so often.\r\n\r\nThis is her second Kiva loan and she feels grateful for the financial support she gets to continue moving forward.  She also commits to make her payments punctually.  On this occasion she wants to have 1,000 new soles to buy seedlings to replace some of the cacao plants that have become damaged.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":172.89,"image":{"id":1409128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
