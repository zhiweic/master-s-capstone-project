She has been running this business since three years ago. She works at the business every day, from morning to night. She says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation.\r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to purchase items such as drinks, cigarettes, biscuits and soap.

She works at the business nine hours per day and 7 days per week. Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of transportation -- to travel with her charcoal during the rainy season when sometimes vehicles break on the way.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to purchase charcoal and wood. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and educate her children. In the future, she plans to change her business to clothing sales.

His plan now is to continue to work on his business and to make it grow. Ramaz applied for credit to MFO Credo. His application was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting vulnerable poors to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2,000 will help Ramaz to improve his store and enlarge the quantity of products he offers.

from Sierra Leone! This is 41-year-old Hawa from the Waterloo eastern area in Freetown. She is married with 8 children between the ages of 6 years and 24 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. She started this business to assist in the daily survival of her family.\r\n \r\nHawa runs a local food business she sells local food within the community. She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business from 4:30 am and she will not rest until the food is finished. Hawa says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nHawa has requested a loan in order to acquire food commodities like cooking seasoning, oil and cassava. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, she plans to own a big cookery shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":54.55,"image":{"id":1391536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is economically independent from them, however. Juan Ariel is a young worker from a humble family who works in agriculture, earning seasonal income selling potatoes and green broad beans that he grows on his own land in the community. Besides being a farmer, he has also recently become an assistant in a mechanic's shop, though he is currently only working there on the weekends so that he can spend his time wisely between his two different jobs. He has expenses in his line of work like buying agricultural stock and he needs additional money to finish a remodeling job that he started on his room so he can live a bit more comfortably there. His parents don't have a lot of money and so he needs to do this himself. He is very happy that he has been given this opportunity to be able to finish his remodeling project and he also tells us that he always helps his parents because, at times, they are not able to take care of his younger siblings when money is tight and he wants them to have a better future than he has been dealt. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1393091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"remodeling his room in his parents' home.

She has 8 hectares of cacao, 1 hectare of bananas, and she uses the rest of the land to raise animals.\r\n\r\nShe says that she likes living in the country since she knows the rhythm of the work and how to execute it because she has been doing it since she was young with the help of her parents.

She and her husband are involved in growing agricultural crops and also in breeding cattle for their household.  Recently, Zainab's daughter learned sewing from a seamstress in their village and now can independently sew women's national dresses.  At the present time, she needs a sewing machine in order to start her own business.  The mother wants to support her daughter in opening the sewing business and, therefore, requested a loan.

He is married and has two children.  Shukur is very hardworking and loves his family very much.  He tries to make sure that his family does not have any needs.  He is involved in his own business to have a regular income in the family.  Shukur is involved in manufacturing and selling furniture.  He owns a furniture workshop for this purpose.  He started this business over two years ago.  His wife does not work; she stays home and raises the children.  Because their children are still very small, they need good care.  Shukur had previously obtained loans for his business several times.  He adds to his selection of made furniture.  Today, he has many regular customers and also orders from other cities.  This business yields a good income for Shukur, but his family's needs are increasing and he needs to earn more money.

She has a higher education.  Aiymbu has been involved in a construction business, i.e. making cinder blocks, for two years.  She started the business with 50,000 som (KGS).  Aiymbu has a good practical experience in construction.  Thanks to her diligence and patience, today Aiymbu has a good turnover in the business.  She also has a small farm with three dairy cows and ten sheep.  The family's monthly profit amount to 10,000 som (KGS).  The children are grown and live separately.

She lives with her husband and their children in Hamdallaye Extension, one of the populous districts of the town of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nNot having been able to succeed in school due to socio-economic reasons, she got into dyeing and selling damask cloth, a business she learned more than 20 years ago from her older (sister). She is much esteemed by her customers (composed essentially of travelers and transporters) for the quality of her wares and her service. \r\n\r\nWishing to better satisfy her ever-growing clientele she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso around seven years ago. She is now on her seventh individual loan, with all preceding loans correctly reimbursed. \r\n\r\nThis seventh loan will permit her to buy three lengths of white damask of the \"rich Dutch\" brand, 10 boxes of dyes in different shades, and 10 packets of caustic soda. She buys her wares in Bamako but also in Sikasso, from big merchants, before doing the dyeing and then selling the cloth for cash, on order. \r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit, with this loan, of 100,000 F CFA which will be essentially used to grow her working capital, contribute to family expenses, and pay the interest on her loan.

Gulkhan has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for over five years, having started this business with 7,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her patience and hard work, today she earns a monthly profit from the business in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS).  The business contains two dairy cows and eight sheep.  In order to increase livestock headcount, Gulkhan requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle for raising.

is 59-year-old, living in small town called Kutaisi with his wife and a grown son. His wife stays home, taking care of her family. Emzar used to work in Law Enforcement Structures and has the pension from that institution. His son is a loader at the plumbing store and gets a small salary. Their total amount of monthly income is nearly $170, which is hardly enough to cover everyday expenses for a three-member family, \r\n\r\nSo Emzar decided to start a business and increase the family income. As he lacks experience with the new business and does not qualify under income requirements, local credit providers rejected his loan request. It was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Lilian replied she will make greater profits by having more milk to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Lilian has cows and poultry but does not own pigs nor a pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile. In her house she has mosquito nets but no electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD player. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards that will occur based on this loan. \r\n<p>\r\nLilian was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that training happens before loans are disbursed. When asked what she learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session, Lilian said saving was better than consuming.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper usage, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":103.02,"image":{"id":1391684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1323.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1358.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1394.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1431.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1469.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1507.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1547.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1630.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1673.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1717.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1763.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1809.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1857.02},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1957.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2008.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2062.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.43},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":14.08,"local_amount":1207,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1223.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820317,"comment":null},{"amount":14.45,"local_amount":1238.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1255.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417416,"comment":null},{"amount":14.84,"local_amount":1271.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1288.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980944,"comment":null},{"amount":12.89,"local_amount":1105.27,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1120.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880993,"comment":null},{"amount":17.32,"local_amount":1484.48,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529606,"comment":null},{"amount":29.44,"local_amount":2523.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2557.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753473,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T21:51:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585162,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya.

is a 42-year-old who lives in Sanniquille, the capital city of Nimba County, which is rich in nature resources and where living conditions are much better than in the capital city of Liberia. It is the second largest most populous county in Liberia. She described herself as a hard-working woman. She completed ninth grade, and she has lived all her life in Sanniqulle. She is married, traditionally, and her husband is a security guard. They have eight children between the ages of 3 and 22, she said. Only two of her children are in school, and they all live in the same house, which was built by her husband. With a little money from her husband, she was able to establish her business, in which she sells dried bush meat at a table in the local market. She spends 10 hours on her business, from Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is having only a few goods on her table. She is applying for a loan to buy more dried bush meat for her business. Her plan is to build a modern house one day.

Together, they have five children between 1 week and 10 years old. She said that only three of her children are in school, and they all live in the same house which was built by her husband.\r\n\r\nWith a little money from her husband, she was able to establish her table business in the local market. There, she sells palm oil. She spends 10 hours per day on her business, from Monday to Saturday. One problem she faces in the business, is having too few goods on her table. She is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business inventory. Her plan is to build her dream

He has three children. For the past six years, Kennedy has been a farmer who sells milk, eggs, and crops. He finds milking to be the most enjoyable part of farming and states that operating costs are the biggest challenge. Animals on his farm have been given names of Leel and Met. When asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for his loan, replied, \"low interest rate.\"  Kennedy learned record keeping during Juhudi's required microfinance training session. His highest monthly expense is farming costs and he expects his loan to benefit his family by \"increasing the food supply.\" \n\nKennedy is requesting a loan to buy a dairy cow.

They have five children between the ages of 7 and 24, only three of whom are presently attending school and live at home. She started her business with a little money from her husband. She has established her business and, for seven years, she been selling oil and rice from a table in the local market. She spends nine hours on her business. A problem she faces is her small income.

Her husband is a farmer and looks after the vegetable cultivation and sales business. Presently Hema is getting 6 liters of milk per day and supplying it to a tea stall at a nearby town @ 16 INR per litre. With this small income she is hardly able to manage her household expenses as well as farming expenses. \r\n\r\nSo to enhance that income Hema has planned to invest a part of the present loan to buy another cow and purchase seeds, fertilizer and pesticides from the other part. Hema dreams of developing a big dairy farm in future and repairing her dug well for vegetable cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group Binapani, Debaki and Anle are running a fish selling business and a vegetable vending business respectively. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1391823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for purchasing a cow, seeds, fertilizer and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"BADI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binapani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T04:34:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585248,"name":"Fanta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fanta is 33 years old and lives in Ganta, one of the most talked-about cities in Nimba County.

Jagannath with the purpose of developing their existing trade by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Puspanjali, the energetic lady of 26 years sitting on the extreme left with raised hand, is one of them. She is very active and always cheerful. Her family consists of her husband and mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nFrom last six years Puspanjali has been operating a cloth vending business with the help and support of her husband. She purchases sari and ready-made garments from the local market as well as from wholesale market 200 kilometers away. Her husband goes to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR from her existing business, but the present income is like hand to mouth for her family. \r\n\r\nSo Puspanjali wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business.

married and has two children (one son and one daughter).  She has a secondary-specialized education and works as a nurse at a local hospital.  She has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - since 2000, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Anarkan's husband helps her with the business by feeding and reselling livestock.  The family's monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anarkan's hard work, today she has a small business, containing three dairy cows.  Anarkan has all of the conditions for keeping livestock.  The profit allowed her to increase livestock headcount in her household.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkan requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for future fattening up and resale.  Anarkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further increase of livestock quantity and to provide a decent education for her children in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":287.54,"image":{"id":1391535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy livestock for future fattening up and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aitamga village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T23:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T23:10:12Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2223},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2174},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2239},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2328},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2463},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2518},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2593},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2702},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2751},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2838},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2796}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.31,"local_amount":2223,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2266.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495585,"comment":null},{"amount":45.29,"local_amount":2174,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2216.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743818,"comment":null},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":2239,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014056,"comment":null},{"amount":48.5,"local_amount":2328,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2373.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777119,"comment":null},{"amount":49.48,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2421.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426946,"comment":null},{"amount":51.31,"local_amount":2463,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T19:30:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585334,"name":"Donald","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donald has been running his business, Doughboys Arkansas Youth Catering Company, for three years in Little Rock, Arkansas.

This group is located in Tres Valles, a region with a high employment in pineapple and sugar cane cultivation. \r\n\r\nGaudencio is one of the members of this group. He explains that just over 15 years ago he established a small farm near his home to breed and raise pigs. He says that he really enjoys this work because it is his source of employment and it has helped him to support his family for several years. He notes that this job keeps him busy all day. In the morning he feeds the pigs and cleans their styes. He then visits the neighbouring homes in his community to collect the waste that people put out. This way he does not need to invest as much in food for the animals. He also sells cheese to supplement his income. \r\n\r\nGaudencio has requested this loan from VisionFund because he wants to purchase some pigs, food and deparasite treatments so that he can continue with his work. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to be able to make some home improvements and provide his wife with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nGaudencio appreciates the support that he and the group have been given through these loans. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include: \r\nBlanca, who sells cosmetics\r\nJaime, who sells food\r\nRuben, who operates a nutrition club \r\nMacario, who works in masonry\r\nLucia, who sells snacks\r\nAmado, who sells candy\r\nMagdalena, who sells clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":1393196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase pigs and food.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Valles, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-07-22T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-21T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaudencio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruben Dario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Amado ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698707,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698708,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698709,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9053.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944860,"comment":null},{"amount":725,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9053.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227934,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4526.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T06:46:35Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:45:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585386,"name":"Olivia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olivia began her business, ISR Cenla, LLC, six months ago in Alexandria, Louisiana.  ISR, or Infant Swimming Rescue, works with children ages six months to six years old and teaches them how to self-rescue themselves in water.  According to the latest Center for Disease Control and Prevention report, \u201cdrowning is the leading cause of injury death among children aged 1 \u2013 4 years.\u201d  It is the third leading cause of death in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nISR begins teaching the children how to roll over and float until they are rescued. Children over one year of age learn how to do the same but also turn over and swim until they reach a safe place. These children learn to not overly exert themselves to the point of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOlivia believes children and their families should have the tools necessary to survive in the water. ISR also incorporates learning about other ways to prevent drowning incidents. Examples include setting up pool fences, alarmed doors and locking windows leading to the pool when children are wandering, having a certified CPR family or friend prepared, and most important, effective adult supervision. Each of these preventive measures helps reduce the risk of children falling in a pool.\r\n\r\nOlivia went to the Small Business Development Center in Alexandria and was referred to Accion Texas Inc. for a business loan. Once Olivia received approval for a $5,450 Accion loan, she used her loan for training materials, website production, start-up fees, and certification fees to be able to teach ISR. Olivia continues to educate the community about ISR and grow her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":904.41,"image":{"id":1392133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

","en":"Luis is 44 years old.  He is married and has 4 children.  He has worked in construction and security, but 17 years ago when his last work contract ended, he decided to work for himself, thanks to advice from a friend who worked as a street vendor.  He began selling avocados and fruit, and now he also sells fish.  Thanks to this work, he has been able to earn money to support his family.  He is a hard worker, with a desire to succeed.  He goes out to sell his products starting at 4:30 in the morning and works until 2:30pm.  He likes this schedule very much because besides in addition to work, he has time to take care of his home and care for his children. Luis knows he needs to keep fighting for his family, so for this reason he is requesting a loan that he will invest in the purchase of portable coolers and wholesale fish and fruit, in order to take advantage of the discounts they offer.  In this way he will have a variety of fresh products available to meet the needs and tastes of his customers.  Like everyone, Luis also wants to make his dreams a reality.  In particular, he wants to save money to set up his own fish shop, which would enable him to offer employment opportunities and to improve the quality of life of his whole family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":226.56,"image":{"id":1393469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase portable coolers and wholesale inventory (fish and fruit).

With the investment, he will be able to manage his crop and so, at the end of production, be able to guarantee food for his family and income for other necessities that come up with the sale of the harvest surplus.\r\n\r\nHis intention is to see his grandchildren grow up with the opportunities that he and his children could not have because of the poverty in which they lived, and to continue cultivating his land.

She learned to work with animals as a child and her grandfather taught her how to grow corn. Her father abandoned her and her brothers when she was very young. For the last six years she and her life partner have been raising their own livestock. She also breeds and fattens pigs to make more money to help their children's studies and pay other expenses. In spite of her young age Veronica has a strong desire to improve her living standard, taking the initiative to find ways to make income for her family. The reason that she wants this loan demonstrates how enterprising she is.\r\n\r\nShe buys concentrated feed 6 kilometers from her home. She pays local trucks to transport the goods. She also looks for corn and sorghum waste that farmers in the area leave to feed her cattle, thus reducing her production costs. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan from Fundacion Campo to buy three calves, taking advantage of the rainy season with it's abundant grasses to fatten them. She will sell them at a profit in order to make a little more money for her family. What she wants to do with the money from the loan is to take advantage of the opportunity (the rainy season) when she can fatten cattle with less expenses and pay for the basic necessities for her children.\r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to have more cattle, which would allow her children to study until university. She couldn't study past Grade 3 as she had to work to help her grandfather. So at a very young age she had to leave her studies and a brighter future behind.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1393934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy three calves to fatten during the rainy season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-11T04:07:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586446,"name":"Mujeres En Victoria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento MUJERES EN VICTORIA est\u00e1  compuesto por diez integrantes, nueve mujeres y un var\u00f3n,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

As the eldest of the brothers he had to sacrifice his youth in order to help out, and started working at the age of 7.\r\n\r\nHe has always worked in agriculture. Currently, along with his wife, they not only grow plants but also raise and fatten livestock. They currently have a pair of oxen. Due to the low prices offered for their products, they have to look for a way to compensate, so they collect and sell firewood for another small source of income.\r\n\r\nThey buy their agricultural inputs in another community and bring them home in a truck that they pay for. Pedro's take on the price situation is that inputs are expensive and sales prices are down, but he knows that if he doesn't grow his crops he won't have any way to feed his family next year.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he requests from the Fundacion Campo is to buy fertilizers, compost, pesticides, and herbicides needed to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn. With the investment he hopes to be able to sustain his family in the coming year. \r\n\r\nHe wants to form a cooperative association with other small farmers, so that they can have negotiating power when they sell their products. The buyers  impose their prices on them and a large part of the profits ends up in the hands of middlemen, but they have to sell because they are in need. For this reason he thinks of a cooperative as an alternative.

It is the second time that this group has requested financial help from Alid\u00e9, so that they can expand their businesses. The representative of the group, whose name is Assiba Jeanne, is the one with her hand raised in the photo. Assiba Jeanne is 62 years old and lives in Benin. She attended school very little. She no longer lives with her husband but is mother to five children. Some of the children are at school and two are her dependents. In order to provide for the needs of her two dependents, Assiba Jeanne has for the past five years been selling chickens, ducks and guinea fowl on a door-to-door basis. She gets her supplies in the north of Benin.

He is married and has three children. He learned to work raising cattle when he was a child with his father, since it was the only thing they knew how to do, as they had no education and there is a lack of employment in El Salvador. Every morning Pedro takes his animals to the pasture so that they can eat and in the afternoon he takes them back home again to keep them in their pen and not risk being stolen. Pedro has a yoke for oxen that he uses to help neighbors to plow the land and earth up their crops. That is how he gets other income to support his crops and his family. \r\n\r\nTo buy his steers, he has to get on a truck in his community and travel 45 minutes till he arrives in Tiangue. There he spends the better part of a day until he gets the animals he likes and later he has to put them on the truck and return home. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy 4 steers to fatten up with grazing and also buy agricultural materials for his vegetable and corn crops.  With the investment, he will buy his steers and have them graze for a certain amount of time to later sell them and make a profit so his family can eat and he can pay off the loan. When he has a larger number of animals, he will have more income in a more continuous way which will help his family to secure their subsistence.  \r\n\r\nHe plans to work very hard to build a brick house for his children, since right now they live in a sheet metal house. He also wants to help his children study and have good careers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1393975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy four steers to fatten with grazing and also to buy agricultural materials to grow vegetables and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-23T10:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-22T10:00:20Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T14:50:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585510,"name":"Dung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dung, 40 years old, is married and has two children.
