They sell the agricultural products in the local market, which is an important source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nSrbuhi and her husband also make besom and sell it in the local market. To continue her agribusiness in a sustainable way, Srbuhi needs a loan of 1,300 USD to purchase fertilizers and needed materials for making besom. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Srbuhi was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Srbuhi and her husband will be thankful to all lenders for helping them to maintain their agribusiness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99,"image":{"id":1467711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers and needed materials for making besom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Nor Kharberd village, Ararat region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T05:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Srbuhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":51.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53.32},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":57.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":58.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.32},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.54},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.62},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99,"local_amount":99,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439846077,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T16:24:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630684,"name":"Jesselyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesselyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines.

She believes that someday soon, her dreams and plans will become a reality.  Sahyly is a mother to one son, who has now left home.  Sahyly is married and completed nine years of school, finishing her basic education.  Alongside her husband, Sahyly makes a living growing coffee.

Sahyly and her husband own the land they work - they bought it some years ago.  At the end of every season, Sahyly and her husband's customers for the coffee are intermediaries who come to the area.  For the pizza and banana business, customers are neighbours, friends and family of the couple.\r\n\r\nSahyly has applied for a loan from COMIXMUL in order to buy supplies such as urea, manure, herbicides, fertilisers, and more, in order to protect her coffee crops and so that she can have an excellent harvest.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Sahyly plans to buy premises where she can open her business more formally.  Growing coffee at her age is not very easy and so, in the near, future, Sahyly would also like to buy machines, such as a coffee pulper in order to save a little money.  The varying price of coffee means that good profits are not guaranteed and so it can be difficult to know whether to hire labourers or not."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.95,"image":{"id":1467319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies to help her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sahyly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.95,"local_amount":19.42,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":19.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042156,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-23T07:08:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630543,"name":"Soraya Mar\u00eda Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Tosagua cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fane el Banco Comunal Din\u00e1micas, este lugar se lo conoce por ser muy din\u00e1mico donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y a la cr\u00eda de animales, por ser una zona con gran vegetaci\u00f3n.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Soraya, tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tiene tres hijos de 24, 22 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad, el menor estudian en universidad y es quien aun vive con ella.

So to love your future job you must not make a mistake not only with the choice of profession but also with the choice of a proper university. I have dreamed about enrolling AUCA and I am happy that my dream came true. Of course the first reason is education. Nowadays education is the main facility for attainment of all your aims and becoming successful person in the future. If earlier the strongest person was one who had a weapon, now it is brain and acquired knowledge. I think that AUCA has all resources to give opportunity to get such high knowledge to students who try to get it. There is a wonderful library at AUCA. There is everything necessary for students. Another reason of my choice is a pleasant atmosphere and contingent. When you enter AUCA you immediately feel friendly spirit and desire of students to study. Among all the departments I chose business administration. Business will be required job whole over the world. Among all the above-mentioned opportunities AUCA provides financial aid to all its students, which is a Kiva loan. I would also like to take an opportunity and apply for Kiva loan. It will give me a great chance to cover my tuition

At an early age, her parents taught her to work the land where they grew coffee, corn, and beans. She is the mother of four children who attend a local school. Florentina has garnered much experience in the 10 years she has been growing coffee along with her husband, as coffee grows well in the area where they live because the soil is fertile and the climate is good for this crop. She and her husband own the land they cultivate, thanks to the purchase they made from one of their customers a while ago.

Specifically, she will buy 100 chickens and concentrated chicken feed. With this small project of producing fattened chickens she will be able to make more income for her family. The idea of a chicken farm is something which she and her husband have had for some time and at last having their own chicken farm has become a reality thanks to the loan.\r\n\r\nIn the future Martha wants to have a bigger farm and a larger chicken production and better employment for herself and her husband and to live comfortably in a decent place with their son.

She is married and together with her husband makes a living from agriculture by growing coffee. They have 2 children, one 15 years old in the third year of junior high school, and a 20-year-old daughter who graduated from high school in science and literature.\r\n\r\nOneyda is good at coffee growing since she learned how to do it more than two years ago. Her husband instructed her and taught her all the different activities that need to be undertaken to keep her coffee plants healthy and protected. He has always been a farmer.\r\n\r\nThey bought the land that they work, finding challenges such as the decrease of coffee prices and the scarce rain a (weather factor). She considers that in this field competition is not a problematic factor since they have well-defined customers.

Armine and her family will be very thankful to the lenders for their goodwill and support in collecting the needed amount of loan to sustain their agribusiness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":153,"image":{"id":1468056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase besom seeds, fertilizers, and pigs, and pay for the harvesting services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Ayntap village, Ararat region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":76.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":76.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89.49},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.58},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.49},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":153,"local_amount":153,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":153,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439846080,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-30T02:00:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630897,"name":"Estelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estelita is 58 years old, married, and mother of four children.

 It is difficult to get employment in the village and this is why he develops his own business.  He built large greenhouses and plants two harvests of cucumbers.  The provision for the family for the entire year depends on the invested labor.  Knowing this, Valeriy wants to purchase more land because it is known that the land feeds.  And now, unexpectedly, his parents decided to give their son their land plot because they can no longer work on it.  Valeriy became very happy that an opportunity to expand his business presented itself and will build two large greenhouses.  He did not have enough money for this and this is why he decided to obtain a business loan.  He had previously used loans from Kiva and knew where to request a loan.  He likes the convenient repayment schedule, where the main repayments can be made at the end of the loan, after gathering the harvest.  Valeriy's family will already be enjoying the new greenhouses at the end of this autumn because now their financial well being will significantly improve."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build two greenhouses on a new plot","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeriy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13333},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13333},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1633.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1633.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1633.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-11T02:58:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630888,"name":"Uhai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha, who is in her late 40s, is a widow.

Kamenka Dnieper. He served in Afghanistan, then married and started in his favorite business growing tomatoes and cucumbers. He is experienced in this business, knows how to care for plants and to date has developed quite a large farm. He has five large greenhouses. To develop such a farm he had the help of previous business development loans.\r\n\r\nDespite the experience of Alexei's greenhouse business, this year it has failed. Alexei planted a second harvest of cucumbers and the plants were well developed, looked good, and had no signs of trouble. Suddenly, in September, the cold came and there was even frost on the ground, and because of all this the plants died. Alexei suffered a loss, but he did not despair because he knew that he could count on help in the form of a loan with favorable conditions. Alexei is asking for a loan for the amout of 30,000 Hryvnia to buy seeds, fertilizer, and film to make the planting again for the spring season. He believes that this is a temporary difficulty and next year will make every effort to grow a good

When she was 15 she became involved in the field of making clothes.  She took some training courses, and when she got married she set up her own shop.  She set it up in the rented house that she lives in with her husband and their two children.\r\n\r\nIn time, she specialized in high fashion dressmaking.  She works alone every day.  This way she generates enough resources to help her husband with the responsibility of the household finances.  Her drive, strength, and dedication have allowed her to strengthen her business.  She is now well-known in the area where she lives because of her track record and the excellent quality of her work.\r\n\r\nThe reason she is requesting the loan is to buy an overlock sewing machine.  The one that she has is several years old, and it constantly breaks down.  With the new machine she will be able to streamline her production process, and her working conditions will improve.

She is a woman who knows how to overcome adversity: with a lot of hard work and dedication, she has been able to get her family ahead.  About 15 years ago, she started working in on-contract sewing, work which she learned from a family member.  She has the help of one employee and another person who works with her on a day by day basis. She works every day from 7:00 am until 9:00 pm from the comfort of her home. Not paying rent for a shop helps her get more out of what she charges for her services.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is currently requesting will help her finish paying off the balance on the last two sewing machines that she bought.

She is married to Gregorio, an employee, and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often at a single price for all of the items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting her supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nHelen dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

Her profits the from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and child\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nCelia still hopes that her business will soar and dreams to give her family a beautiful future.

Comparing two different countries like the USA and Kyrgyzstan, one that is developed and another developing, has really opened my eyes. I would like to run my own business, which is a swimming pool with hot tubs that is open throughout the year, and that is affordable to everyone. This is how people can care about their health. So, studying at AUCA is a great opportunity for me to realize all of my plans for the future, to put Kyrgyzstan is a global dimension so that more and more international companies are interested in investing in my country. AUCA is going to open the doors to the whole world for me and I am very excited to study here. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all its students, and even gives financial assistant to all of them. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity and apply for Kiva loan.

She and her husband are raising three children.  She has a specialized secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this business a year ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Venera's hard work, her farming business now comprises one dairy cow and one calf.  She also owns 0.7 hectare (1.72 acre) of land on which she grows peppers and corn annually.  She makes a monthly income of 12,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Venera has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy some cows for breeding. \r\n\r\nShe plans to re-invest some of her profits back into her business by purchasing additional livestock. She is also planning to save enough money to continue to finance her children's education.

Janyl has a high school education, and to earn her family's sole source of income she farms and raises animals. She started 19 years ago with the purchase of animals for 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tireless work, Janyl now owns three dairy cows and 1.20 hectares of arable land on which she grows beans, peppers, and clover each year. Her monthly income is 9,000 som (KGS).

Batma has a high school education. To earn the sole source of income for her family Batma raises livestock. She began the business 23 years ago with the purchase of 5,000 som (KGS) of livestock. Thanks to her tireless work, Batma now owns two milk cows, two sheep, and 2.54 hectares of land which she grows peppers, beans, and clover on each year. Her monthly income is 11,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Batma is asking the Microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a 100,000 som (KGS) loan to buy bull calves to expand her herd. She plans to invest the income from use of the loan into further growing her herd, and she also plans to save for a dowry for her daughter.

She also owns 0.3 hectare (0.74 acre) of land on which she grows potatoes, corn and alfalfa.  She makes a monthly income of 7,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Mairamgul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" and requested a loan of 120,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to buy some cows which she will fatten and then resell at a higher price at the market. \r\n\r\nShe plans to re-invest her profits from this loan back into her business by purchasing additional livestock.

They are involved in cattle breeding, in breeding pigs and piglets, and in cultivation of cabbage. Julieta and her husband realize the agricultural products in the local market. The latter is the main source of their income. As the autumn is progressing and winter is very close, Julieta needs to make some investments in her agribusiness to prepare it for the winter. She needs a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase forage for the livestock (alfalfa, barley, and combined forage). The loan will help her run the agribusiness in a sustainable way.

She learned it well and liked it, and decided to set up a small workshop in her home to make costume jewelry (earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces) and embroidered regional costumes.  What she enjoys most about her work is that she can be creative to come up with different styles of earrings, bracelets, rings and necklaces that her customers will like.  She works on the jewelry at home but in the afternoon goes to friends' and neighbors' houses to sell her products.  Sometimes she receives orders for custom designs.  Martha says she earns more from the regional costumes because by selling one she can make the same amount of money as she does with one month's sale of jewelry.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan through VisionFund to buy threads, fabrics, rhinestones and a punch press to continue with her craft work.

She sells beverages, fried food and candies. In November she also makes wreaths to sell on the Day of the Dead because people buy them from her and take them to the cemeteries to their family members' graves. She has already started to make the wreaths, but she has asked for this loan because she needs to invest in buying more materials such as flowers, glue and ribbon to make the wreaths, as well as candies, beverages and fried foods to stock her store. \r\n\r\nMaricela says that selling the wreaths is only once a year and she should take advantage because she sells a lot because she has been making them for years for her friends and customers who order them ahead of time.\r\n \r\nShe hopes that with this investment her business will have good earnings since she would like to do some home improvements and do some work on her locale to sell snacks and beverages.\r\n\r\nThe Mariposas group thanks Kiva and VisionFund for the support they are giving through these loans.

Clarissa, who sells snacks; and Nicol\u00e1s, who raises pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":277.5,"image":{"id":1461524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Progreso, Tierra Blanca, Ver.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3645.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644512,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-15T20:10:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631161,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic manure","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":215.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":229.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":236.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":244.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":257.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":263.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":273.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":279.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-13T20:37:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631081,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 45 years old and comes from Olkalou.
