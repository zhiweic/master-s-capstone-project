He also specializes in cruises. Tim has been on almost all of the major cruise lines and considers himself an expert on the demographics of the clientele on each of the lines. He's traveled to Bermuda, the Bahamas and Alaska.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked how he can compete with the online travel services, Tim says that he beats their prices because the online companies charge an additional fee that Tim does not charge.  \r\n\r\nHe heard about Kiva on the radio in New Orleans. Coincidentally, he plans to use his loan proceeds to advertise his business on the radio and also to buy ads on the street cars in New Orleans.

","en":"Natalya is 51 years old.  She works as an economic development specialist at the local administration office.  In 1996, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Natalya started her animal husbandry business with an initial sum of 6,000 som (KGS).

She's been doing this work ever since she stopped working as an employee of a company.  She took her severance pay, and gradually invested it in fabric to make decorative items for babies.  She makes crib canopies, crib bedding and baby accessories by hand, which are commissioned by her friends.  This has allowed her to gradually make profits, so that she could buy a sewing machine and give herself the task of acquiring customers who will buy the products that she makes and designs, either on a cash or credit basis.  Luz, in her quest for growth, has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organization to request a Kiva loan to increase her working capital, as she needs to make cash wholesale purchases of raw materials and supplies to make crib canopies, bed sheets, pillows and small pillow-cases that she has orders for.  With this investment, she will be able to reduce her costs, because she will get a discounted price if she can buy in cash and in a bigger volume than usual.

With his tireless labour he has educated his children and provided them with decent living conditions.

The oldest has a family of his own.  Marcelino lives with his wife, children and daughter-in-law in a house that he owns in Zona Patria, a rual town in Chanchamayo province.  Marcelino is a happy, optimistic man, qualities that he applies to his work.  He learned farming as a boy and it's now his main source of income and his means of supporting his family.  He owns 6 hectares [about 15 acres] of land, 4 of which he's set aside for growing coffe and platanos.  His last harvest yielded 32 sacks of [dropped word--probably coffee] which he sold at a good price.  Each platanos crop yields 40 to 50 \"arrobas\" [a unit of weight equal to somewhere between 11 and 16 pounds, depending on the region] of platanos which he can sell locally for 4 soles per arroba.  He says that he couuld make more for his crop in the city, but he sells at a local market because the extra amount that he can make in the city isn't enough to cover the related transportation expenses.  Farming is hard work and he relies on his children to help him sow, tend, fertilize and harvest his fields.  Marcelino is applying for this, his 7th, MFP loan and says that he is committed to repaying it on time.  He is happy with his community bank, Mujeres al futuro.  \r\nHe will use part of this loan to buy organic manure for his next coffee crop and the rest to pay for day laborers who he will pay 25 soles for each 8-hour day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":988477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers for his farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T21:00:05Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T21:50:04Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384581,"name":"Anush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anush, who was born in 1963, lives in Sevan with her husband, two sons and a daughter-in-law.

The business is successful because she is friendly and helpful but, more importantly, because she keeps a clean, well-ordered selling space, something that her customers value.  \r\n\r\nAydee is grateful for the support that she's received from Kiva lenders in the past because she's been able to use the loans to grow her business.  She says that summer seasonal fruits are especially valuable because they add to the range of products she can sell and because her customers want them.  She is saving to fulfill her greatest wish: \"to buy a stall of my own\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":988475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to stock

Early every morning, he and his wife get up and begin the process of grinding corn to prepare their delicious rolls, filled with cheese and with corn. They also supervise and work with one employee in the food stall, where they sell arepas (a filled cornbread) of eggs, sweets, or cheee, carima\u00f1olas (a stuffed fritter made from yucca), coffee with milk, and cold soft drinks, so that their customers, however early they pass through the door of their business, are attracted by the cases full of fresh products for consumption that they sell there for breakfast. Eduardo and his wife began their business 10 years ago, offering small quantities of fried food and coffee to the community in general, in a little sales area in their house. Joining their efforts and their work discipline, their business grew and their capital increased until they were able to offer complete breakfasts, and then they reached the point where they could sell beverages and natural fruits juices from their region in a room that was adequate to tend to their customers. Their dream is to expand and make their business independent until they are able to have a big restaurant, but the business needs to grow in market, and their working capital is insufficient to do it alone. This is the reason why they have turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that they have had at Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which they will buy corn, coffee, oil, powdered milk, cheese, meats, and eggs in larger proportion, so that they can start increasing the products they offer and begin to negotiate with shops around their neighborhood. The investment that Eduardo is planning will be successful, because of his experience as a micro-entrepreneur and because he has managed to have a pre-sale, which will increase the volume of clients who buy in greater quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":988497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, coffee, oil, powdered milk, cheese, meats, and eggs in larger volume","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo Emilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53328},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79539},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81395},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83294},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85237},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87226},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89261},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91344},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":93476},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95657},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97889},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":132354}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.9,"local_amount":53328,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54544.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039183,"comment":null},{"amount":570.1,"local_amount":1016672,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1039855.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651315,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T15:26:51Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384477,"name":"Sari Pertiwi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Sari Pertiwi group continues to have a loan from MUK to purchase superior piglets.

Buyers from the cities of Lima and Huancayo gather at the market to transport the harvest in trucks. \r\n\r\nShe is satisfied with her results but she says that she needs some support in acquiring financing. She is happy with the work she has done with MFP. This is her tenth loan with MFP and as such she is committed to being punctual in making her payments. Additionally she says that she feels comfortable with her communal bank, Los Pioneros de Cumutay.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan in the purchase of a bag of pea seeds which she will use to begin planting. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":988528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a bag of pea seeds.

She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy raw materials for her business.  In the future, Padma Laxmi plans to improve the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\n\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand-tool finishing.  In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit

He parents were simple workers.   After she finished school, Elmira helped her family around the house.  At the time she could only dream about further education as the money her parents earned was enough only for food.  The family's main source of income was growing beets, and from her childhood Elmira has a great deal of experience in working with domesticated animals and in growing field crops. \r\n\r\nAfter she married, Elmira and her husband made their home in a tiny shack on the edge of their village and grew beets on 1\/10 ha (about 1\/4 acre) of land.  Their young family made it through many troubles and, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, endured difficult years.  There was no work in the village and at that time Elmira and her husband were raising five children and had two dairy cows.   Besides their own children, Elmira and her husband helped their parents' families where they had younger brothers and sisters.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Elmira's perseverance and persistence, today she has two dairy cows and two young bulls.

She is married to Alberto, her business partner, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to be able to expand soon.

They began the business 15 years ago and since then have been growing significantly with their vulcanization shop and, now, mechanical shop.  \r\n\r\nBusiness is going very well because they have good customers.  But like everyone, she has goals and wants to expand the workshop.  This is her fifth loan through MFP.  She is very content with the financial support because she is confident she will be able to progress in the business.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time, as with the previous loans.  She is happy with her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and very responsible.  The 3000 PEN loan will be used to buy materials and tools to continue providing excellent service at her workshop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":988765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"To buy materials and tools for her workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T11:40:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":458.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":455.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":496.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":515.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":524.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":549.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":171.95,"local_amount":458.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":462.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246307,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":455.54,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":459.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386319,"comment":null},{"amount":186.25,"local_amount":496.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":501.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099412,"comment":null},{"amount":193.2,"local_amount":515.2,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":520.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713558,"comment":null},{"amount":196.58,"local_amount":524.21,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":529.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202446,"comment":null},{"amount":206.19,"local_amount":549.84,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":555.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098129,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T18:04:47Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384667,"name":"Rhoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhoda is 30 years old and the single mother of one child aged 14 years.

She is married to Bejamine, a vendor, and is a mother of five children. She and her husband share responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is a well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a fertilized duck egg that has not been hatched. Instead it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the selling to lessen expenses of paying commissions to vendors that will sell the eggs. They earn about 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 12,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which is selling quail eggs and fried chicken skin. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin, and she wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. \r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little bit more to make this come true because she has to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. Darlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* meetings as they inspire her to go on with their life no matter what the obstacles are, because she has a big God Who will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":991406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Since 1990 Varsik and her husband have been engaged in animal breeding and land cultivation. With joint effort they breed two cows, a calf and 12 sheep. Also they grow fodder for their farm animals. Varsik and her husband transport produced farm commodities to Yerevan and sell them there. \r\n\r\nThis is Varsik\u2019s fourth loan from Nor Horizon and she has never delayed her repayments. Now she is seeking for a 1,000,000 AMD loan to buy two more cows and also fodder for farm animals, as their fodder burned down because of a fire.  Varsik and her husband will use future income to buy a truck which will be very helpful them in their agricultural occupation.

Thanks to income from his business, Levon built on an additional storey of his shop and also was able to roof it. But he hasn\u2019t made interior repairs of that additional storey yet. Also Levon has partitioned off a part of his shop, where he has placed three computers and has started to manage an internet-cafe. That fact allows him to increase his profit from his businesses. \r\n\r\nNow Levon is seeking a 1,000,000 AMD loan to increase his shop assortment before the New Year\u2019s holidays.

To support her large family Jyldyzkan opened a grocery store in 1995. With a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and a lot of hard work and perseverance Jyldyzkan expanded her business to yield 5,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. Aside from the grocery store the household also has two milk cows and the dairy sales provide an additional source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her business by expanding her grocery inventory, Jyldyzkan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS). She is going to invest the profits from this expansion to improve her grocery business. In the future Jyldyzkan is planning to develop both the grocery and dairy sales so that the two enterprises can support each other during the down seasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":992281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to broaden the assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kerben town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyzkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975624,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10045.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285473,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339062,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10045.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329662,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070972,"comment":null},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":15068.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459394,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T06:33:35Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385173,"name":"Jumakhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0415\u043c\u0443 37 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044f\u043d.","en":"Jumakhon is a farmer and has been growing wheat for the last three years.

","en":"Saltanat is 46 years old, married and is raising three children.  In 2006, in search of an income source for her family, she started her own business of selling office and household goods, using a sum of 10,000 som (KGS) as an initial capital.  Traveling to a market to sell their merchandise, Saltanat and her husband put forth all their efforts to develop this business and achieved success.  Today, they have a goods turnover of about 50,000 som (KGS).  Currently, the goods selection is limited, and this is why Saltanat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  Purchasing merchandise will allow her to expand the goods selection, increase the number of customers and increase sales.  Saltanat plans to invest the profits into purchasing a car in order to have an ability to sell her merchandise in remote villages."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":992453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office

She works as an accountant in the local water users association and raises livestock to supplement her salary.
