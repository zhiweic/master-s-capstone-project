In the photo, she appears standing up on the right side of the photo, smiling, and wearing a short-sleeved black top. At this bank, the members have various businesses such as selling kebabs, furniture, new and used clothing, undergarments, and pastries. \r\n\r\nMarcela works by selling pastries. She doesn't have an established location but she learned in order to move her son forward since it just the two of them and she needs income to give him a better lifestyle. She started by making pastries about three years ago and learned from reading recipes, cook books and cooking articles. The most difficult part is moving forward with little money, since she doesn't have enough money to set up a business with the equipment and bakery supplies that are necessary to work. This means that she doesn't have money to buy supplies or to eat. She is sure that with the money she will receive, she will do well because she will be able to buy chocolate cookies, molds, and the necessary supplies to sell pastries and chocolates to nearby businesses that have made orders. Her favorite parts of working with Fondo Esperanza are the monetary help they provide, the trust they have in the members, the help, and the unconditional support. She also likes that the communal bank encourages them to move forward in their businesses and with their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1340517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She recently earned her apprentice license and plans to take courses to earn her journeyman license.\r\n\r\n\"CRZ Mechanical LLC\" has been in operation only three months and has already won contracts with several commercial clients. At this rate of growth, Grace was in need of working capital to continue serving new and existing clients while waiting on receivables to come in. Without the funds generated by a loan from ACCION Texas Inc., Grace would not have been able to purchase the additional equipment needed to complete her jobs. The funds also helped CRZ Mechanical LLC to maintain a positive cash flow during this critical growth phase.\r\n\r\nGrace hopes to take on new customers and employees as revenues increase. In the meantime, she continues to learn about the mechanics of the trade as well as improving the management of her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1388.6,"image":{"id":1338884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

is 38 years old. He lives in the Tetritskaro district with his mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Ilia requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have pigs and sell piglets locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nIlia requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Ilia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

He has a large family: parents, brother, sister-in-law, nephew and niece. Vaghinak requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays, the family is out of sources of income, except for the retirement pensions of Vaghinak\u2019s parents. The pensions total 250 Laris (GEL) per month. It is hardly enough for food, for the seven-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Vaghinak requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Vaghinak has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to ordinary credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vaghinak will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 36 years old and lives in Tskaltubo District with her husband,  their two children and her father-in-law who receives a retirement pension. Irma has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests have been rejected each  time, due to low family income and their poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the small amount earned by Irma\u2019s husband who works locally as an artisan. He earns a total of 250 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program aims to provide business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to poor rural people who do not have access to credit products. These poor rural people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Irma will begin trading in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell at higher prices. This will increase her family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":312.48,"image":{"id":1339133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tskaltubo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":950,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":32.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":54.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.32,"local_amount":32.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749631,"comment":null},{"amount":44.2,"local_amount":44.2,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":44.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613538,"comment":null},{"amount":44.58,"local_amount":44.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":44.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857253,"comment":null},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":45.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":45.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133906,"comment":null},{"amount":47.56,"local_amount":47.56,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":47.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107493,"comment":null},{"amount":48.14,"local_amount":48.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":48.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255041,"comment":null},{"amount":49.95,"local_amount":49.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":49.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019191,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T22:07:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552764,"name":"Karisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karisa is a 24-year-old single man.

His wife has recently begun working at a college. His son has a plan to return from military service and begin work as an electrician at a power station. His daughter is married and is wanting to live away from the family. \r\n\r\nThe distance between home and the power station is very far so his son will need to drive a natural gas car. The advantage of a natural gas car is that it has cleaner emissions and less fuel wastage. So Tserendash is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase a natural gas car. The natural gas car will definitely help his son to work enthusiastically and purchasing this car is, in itself, a contribution to the efforts against air pollution.

Last year he built a house on his land but couldn't move into the new house because of its vulnerable walls and floor. However, due to climate change, the Mongolian winter period is extended and he fears his family will be chilled down to their cores as next winter comes.\r\n\r\nSo, he is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, he can repair and make insulation for his house, thus providing more comfortable and warmer accommodation for his family members because a good quality house is advantageous in many ways compared to a Mongolian traditional ger which is mainly made of felts. More importantly, the renovated house will contribute to the efforts against air pollution because the family will burn less coal thus releasing less smoke into the atmosphere.

Pucalipa. He is a very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who always wants to do his best. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Piero was unable to study carpentry, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to cook a delicious smoked fish dish to share with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Piero sells plastics and household items, such as plastic thread, packing tape, glue, brushes, brooms, buckets, and other items. Piero sells door to door in a small radius. He works about ten hours a day and attributes his success to his efforts and his amiability towards customers.

is 50 years old. She lives in Khobi District with her sister and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Dodo requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is the monthly pension of Dodo\u2019s mother. In total, it is 125 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDodo requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Dodo has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit Dodo will begin to trade clothing.

To earn his own money, he decided to begin an adventure in business with support from an experienced friend who had a lot of knowledge of the market in which he would explore. His sales are conducted in cash, as are his purchases, which he makes in the market in the city where he finds competitive prices in order to bring to his clients the best options for accessing his products. His primary clients are neighborhood stores, particularly those that have been referred to him by family or neighbors. His goal is to increase his earnings by selling more items, but his biggest challenge is to have sufficient capital to impact his market and to increase his offerings of his products.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit Konstantine will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, he plans to trade with vegetables and increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1339.48,"image":{"id":1339342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

She is a widow and has nine children, of whom only four live with her. She married when she was sixteen, but her husband died nine years ago of natural causes, and she has been mother and father to their children since then. When Mar\u00eda was very young, her mother taught her how to make bread and tamales, a trade she still practices nowadays, as she was not fortunate enough to go to school. She sells her products in her neighbourhood two or three days a week, and sometimes customers order beforehand. To make tamales, she needs to buy the leaves to a producer and the condiments in her neighbourhood; the hens she breeds herself. To make bread, she needs to go to the city to buy the necessary flour, leavening agent, eggs, sugar, etc. She needs to walk for twenty minutes in order to catch a bus which leaves her in the city in twenty-five. The loan she asks the field partner for she will use to buy six sacks of sweetcorn in order to prepare food to eat at home as well as tamales to sell. In this way, she will have all the ingredients she needs for her business, from which she derives her livelihood. She hopes her income will be enough to enable her to put some money aside to pay for her children's studies once they are old enough to go to university. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.51,"image":{"id":1341234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy six sacks of sweetcorn in order to prepare food, both to eat at home and to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T14:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T14:20:23Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":22.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":23.48},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":26.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":27.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":36.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.48,"local_amount":24.48,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":24.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133745,"comment":null},{"amount":21.41,"local_amount":21.41,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":21.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381938807,"comment":null},{"amount":23.4,"local_amount":23.4,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":23.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801795,"comment":null},{"amount":24.1,"local_amount":24.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":24.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814877,"comment":null},{"amount":24.83,"local_amount":24.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":24.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090716,"comment":null},{"amount":26.28,"local_amount":26.28,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":26.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856715,"comment":null},{"amount":24.67,"local_amount":24.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":24.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429504993,"comment":null},{"amount":28.34,"local_amount":28.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-29T22:36:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":552920,"name":"Ma.

Tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para ser efectiva en su negocio, se ha convertido en su gran desaf\u00edo, por eso acude a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el que compr\u00f3  bolsos, billeteras, correas, mochilas, sabanas, colonias, cremas y cosm\u00e9ticos. Su creidito fue una buena inversi\u00f3n y le sirvi\u00f3 para aumentar sus compras, y vender mucho m\u00e1s y apoyar a su esposo porque sufraga los gastos de su hogar. Ella envia el siguiente mensaje a la Fundaci\u00f3n: \u201cAgradezco a ustedes la ayuda recibida y deseo para sus familiares mucha salud y prosperidad\u201d  Con su primer credikiva, comprar\u00e1 Bolsos, mochilas, correas, billeteras, colonias, cremas, cosm\u00e9ticos,  as\u00ed aumentar\u00e1 su oferta y   sus ingresos,  haciendo de su credikiva la mejor inversi\u00f3n","en":"Jacquelin, 50 years old, works selling varied items such as clothing, footwear, handbags, and imitation jewelry in general, which she distributes on credit and sometimes on installments for her clients, and has been expanding little by little.\r\n\r\nJacquelin previously worked as an employee but at the same time she began her commercial adventure in her free time; but as her clientele grew and the demand for her products increased, there was not enough time for her to handle her business and all the activities of her investment, looking for suppliers, sales, recovering her investment, etc. So she decided to leave her salaried employment and dedicate herself exclusively to the business. Her market share is made up of business employees, people in the neighborhood, relatives, and referrals from her clients. The demand for her products by credit has increased and Jacquelin has found it difficult to respond in a timely way, as first she has to recoup her investment and once she has the money in hand, respond to the customer orders.\r\n\r\nHaving sufficient working capital in order to be effective in her business has been her biggest challenge, which is why she came for a Kiva loan, a second funding through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she bought handbags, wallets, belts, backbacks, sheets, colognes, creams and cosmetics. Her loan was a good investment and allowed her to increase her purchases, and to sell a lot more and to support her husband because he bears the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe sends the following message to the Fundaci\u00f3n: \u201cI am grateful to you for the support received and my wish for your families is much health and prosperity.\u201d With her first Kiva loan, she will buy handbags, backpacks, belts, wallets, colognes, creams, cosmetics, and will expand her merchandise and her income, making the best of her Kiva loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":593.63,"image":{"id":1341105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy handbags, backpacks, belts, wallets, colognes, creams, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T15:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T15:00:19Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129234},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":149361},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":152846},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":156412},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":160062},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":163797},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167619},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":171530},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175532},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":179628},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":183819},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":210160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.08},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.08,"local_amount":129234,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":130249.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705927,"comment":null},{"amount":82.15,"local_amount":149361,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":150535.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968216,"comment":null},{"amount":84.06,"local_amount":152846,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":154047.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817401,"comment":null},{"amount":86.03,"local_amount":156412,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":157641.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323672,"comment":null},{"amount":88.03,"local_amount":160062,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-20T09:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":161320.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082908,"comment":null},{"amount":90.09,"local_amount":163797,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":165084.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062269,"comment":null},{"amount":92.19,"local_amount":167619,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":168936.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731960,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-11T10:04:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554068,"name":"Hugo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Hugo tiene la edad de 27 a\u00f1os, es casado y vive con la esposa y un hijo actualmente.

Working seven days a week and 13 hours a day, she earns about Le 2,249,000 every month from her business. \r\n\r\nSince inadequate capital is her major challenge, she would like to request a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000 in order to buy cartons of powdered milk, biscuit, soap, sweet, drinks, and bottled water to offer for sale. In the future, Emma plans to build a house for the family, continue to educate her children, acquire a shop, and become an international businesswoman. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Emma to generate more income. She is a hard-working and honest businesswoman. She thanks you for your generosity in supporting her business.

from Sierra Leone! This is 20-year-old Haja from the eastern area of Freetown. She is married and has two children between the ages of one and four years old. She did not go to school; she got married at an early age. Her husband is a carpenter, but his income is not enough to feed the family.\r\n\r\nHaja runs a retail business; she sells sugar, cigarettes, biscuits and drinks. She has been running this business for two years. She works at the business throughout the week 10 hours per day. Her business is the only source of income she has. Haja says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of adequate capital to operate her business.\r\n\r\nHaja has requested a loan to buy more sugar, cigarettes, biscuits and drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her installment. In the future, she plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.89,"image":{"id":1339490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is 37-year-old Mariama from the eastern area of Waterloo in Freetown.

She has been running this business since 2009. She works at the business starting at 4:30 in the morning.  She will not rest until the food is finished and goes to the market for the next day.  She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and a proper business location for her cookery shop.\r\n\r\nMariama has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, fish, palm oil and drinks. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and improve her level of living. In the future, she plans to expand her business to a restaurant level. She appreciates your support.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":1339540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Varditer likes the latter occupation and does it with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe married recently, and soon she will become a mother. Varditer continues to produce eastern confections, Armenian traditional sweets, and candies. She sells them to grocery markets in Yerevan. She has a lot of customers, and they prefer to buy candies and sweets from Varditer because her products have specific flavors and aromas, and they're made following old Armenian and eastern recipes. During maternity leave, Varditer decided to continue her candy production. She hopes to help her husband to meet their newly-created family's needs, and to save some money for her newborn child. Consequently, Varditer needs a loan, which she will use to buy a new oven and to buy walnuts, flour and sugar supplies, for her confectionery

She is married and has 2 children, aged 14 and 8 years. They are both going to school. She has 3 additional dependents who live with her to assist her in the business. In 2007, Kadiatu established her business of selling sets of pans, dishes, bowls, spoons, flasks, glasses, plates, cups, knives and pots, etc. She began her business because she dropped out of school because her parents did not value girls' education. She was used instead to assist her mother in business.  \r\n\r\nWhen Kadiatu got married, her husband gave her initial capital to start a business. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about Le1,568,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Kadiatu requires a loan in order to buy sets of pans, dishes, bowls, flasks, glasses, plates and cups.

is 35 years old and a hardworking and independent woman. She is living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband and a son, who is studying in third class. Her husband is a security guard and his income is not enough to meet the household expenses. For 8 years, Sajida has been running a beauty salon, and she wants to purchase some more cosmetic products like makeup kits, facial scrubs, nail polish etc and some fancy chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, Sajida has requested for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. On getting the profit, first of all she would repay the loan amount and then she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both BRAC and Kiva.

She is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic person who does everything to get her family ahead as she has always had to be both mother and father to her son.  Unfortunately, because of a lack of money and the need to work from a very young age to help her parents, Adela was not able to pursue the business administration degree she wanted.  In her free time, she likes to watch the news and sometimes she makes a delicious carapulcra con sopa seca pork stew to share with her family.\r\n\r\nAdela works as an assistant at a hair salon on her own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication.

Her clients are very happy and well satisfied with her work. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring center in her house. She would purchase two new sewing machines so that her production would be increased. She would also purchase some thread and cloth for the purpose of stitching. She would pay for the educational expenses of her children with the profit. She is very hopeful that the loan will be a progressive one for her family.

always had a passion to be an event planner. She loves her eye for perfection to make that special day for someone even more unique. She has been planning weddings and parties for her close friends, family and clients in the Tuscaloosa area for many years.\r\n\r\nSylvia understands the \u201cins-and-outs\u201d of party planning. She has been in the business for more than ten years \u2013 building a strong clientele while also successfully managing her marriage of twenty-eight years and raising her teenage daughter. She has many repeat clients who request her expertise \u2013 so many, in fact, that she knew she would have to obtain working capital to keep up with the demand.  \r\n\r\nThree years ago, she realized that she needed to own her own equipment and stop the cycle of renting equipment and losing money each time she planned an event. That is when she created All for U.  \r\n\r\nThe funds from Accion Texas Inc. allowed Sylvia to purchase her own tables, fabrics, a collapsible room divider and other event equipment to plan that special day for someone. She was also able to keep her two part-time employees and give them an increase in pay for their dedication and hard work. She believes her dedicated employees have been with her for many years because she is able to pay them well and treat them with respect.  \r\n\r\nThese funds allowed All for U to bring in positive cash flow and continue securing events for the future. Without the help from Accion Texas Inc., Sylvia would not have been able to accomplish all of this so quickly.\r\n\r\nSylvia hopes one day to own her own land and facility as revenues increase. For now, she is focusing on learning new ways to be creative with event planning and securing future events to grow her business.
