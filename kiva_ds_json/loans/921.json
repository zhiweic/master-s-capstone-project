She is a woman who dreams of progressing in life. After being a farmer for some time and running a retail shop, she decided to start another business so as to increase her monthly income. In 2010, she decided to start a coconut-selling business, selling to the neighboring countryside since there was demand. She stocks the coconuts in her shop.\r\n\r\nRiziki is working hard to ensure that she provides for her children and also can help her husband, who is a businessman, with the household expenses. She says that her major challenge is transportation cost and that she dreams of expanding her business and opening new businesses in the future. Riziki has insufficient capital to increase her inventory, so she is asking for help from Yehu to add stock of coconuts for sale. This will enable her to increase her profits and provide a quality life for her

future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1157914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical

He has a cow and he provides milk and milk products for his family and in this way he reduces their living costs. Every time he has tried to put some money aside to buy another cow,  something else has always come up that was urgent. He needs a loan to buy another milk cow and to build a new stable in hopes of increasing the dairy production and of course, the earnings from selling dairy products to the locals.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn and winter time, Jeton also sells coal for heating in his community in order to increase family\u2019s income.\r\n\r\nHe says that he plans to invest more in the livestock business and to increase the number of cows he keeps.

However, with experience, he has managed to handle them now and hopes that this loan will automatically expand his business. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1157820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more stock for his retail shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyotera","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2012-08-11T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-10T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukasa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457205,"name":"Emilson Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emilson, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene tres hijos, vive con su familia en una colonia que pertenece al sector de la Lima Cortes.

I enjoyed creating new designs for my parents. I like drawing and I came up with a variety of jewelry designs. I even earned some money with this. I love this job! The nicest part of my jewelry is the uniqueness of its style.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Loice to generate greater profits and pay her children's school fees.

In 2003 she became an independent female farmer and has been growing grapes and strawberries on her allocated plot of land. After Alie's husband passed away her children continued to help her with the farm. Alie has a 23 year old son who is a student at the National Academy of environmental preservation and tourism and a 22 year old daughter who is studying at the Tavric National university. However, to take care of everything on her 0.11 hectare\/0.3 acre plot of land is a big job and Alie also hires a farmhand to help her. To improve soil condition Alie decided to purchase a motorized tiller which will help her til the soil faster and reduce the number of weeds. \r\n\r\nAlie is very grateful for the help that AKM is offering. AKM returned to her the meaning of life after her husband passed away and gave her the dedication to succeed in her farming business. In the future Alie plans to purchase a motorized sprayer for her plants. She needs to take out this loan to purchase this piece of

Yuheni became interested in the program offered and requested a loan amounting to 5,000,000 IDR from TLM in order to purchase basic ingredients, e.g., sugar and wheat flour in bulk, cassava, bananas and several containers in which to put the cakes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":529.98,"image":{"id":1161094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It was then that a friend taught her to make a great variety of food and she began to offer food service to her neighbors, family members and friends. Currently, her business keeps growing and, thanks to the possibility to have her own business in her house, she can offer her five children a better quality of life being their caregiver. Additionally, the income for the home has increased from the potential to contribute a greater quantity along with her husband to pay the bills.

36-year-old Rugiatu from Moriba town in the southern region of Bo, Sierra Leone. She is widowed with 3 children between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Her children are currently attending school. In 1998, Rugiatu established her beverage business. After her husband died during the war, there was no one to take care of her family, so she decided to start the business as a permanent source of income. She works every day, 15 hours a day.

He will reinvest part of his profits into his business and save the rest for his child's education.

When he first began his business, Christovel was only able to provide fertilizer for sale. The business grew little by little and now he is able to sell more items, such as fodder and stationery. Christovel is happy with his business achievements; however, he intends to add farming equipment to his shop because most of the people in this area are farmers who would need this equipment to support their farming activities.

He says this will enable a supply of water on his farm and the ability to farm in both on and off seasons, and more specifically, banana farming. Julius will channel the major part of his farming income towards his children's education. His  focus is to buy more parcels of land for more expansive coffee farming.
