It is known for low availability of employment for people over 40, which is the case with the majority of the members of this group.  Therefore, these women need to generate a source of self-employment.  They manage to do this by selling products by catalog.  They sell a great variety of goods like personal care items, clothes, household goods, and jewelry, etc.  Five of the members will use the loan to invest in this.  Two of the members make underwear.  They sell their products through their colleagues, which creates greater solidarity between them.\r\n\r\nEven though these women live close to the Panamanian border, where there is a very strong commercial zone, they have the opportunity to sell their products.  They sell through a payments system, and their products sell because of their quality.\r\n\r\nAmong the future plans for these women is to be able to keep being a financial support to the household.  This way they achieve a greater quality of life.  The majority of them are women alone, and those that have life partners are paid low salaries or are underemployed.\r\n\r\nThat is why the business activities of these women are so important to generate income for their families.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1128024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise like underwear, perfume, and cosmetics by catalog.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Corredores","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Guiselle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Anita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":2050000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":113888.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":445827,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel is 27 years old and is a married woman from Bien Unido, Bohol.

At first, it was a small parcel of land, but over time he has been able to extend it, thanks to his efforts and dedication.  His wife and their 3 children also help him with this work, because it is a family business.  When it is harvest season, he hires people because the job is too much for them to do on their own.  \r\n\r\nThe coffee that he produces is partly grown with traditional methods, and partly organic.  He wants to convert all of his crops into organic, because he can get a better price for them in the market and at the same time contribute to conserving the environment.  To make this change he must put in new coffee plants, and this is why he needs a loan.  He is also interested in receiving training from the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d organization so that he can take better advantage of the resources that he has and improve his quality of life.

Before that he worked away from his home.  His wife, Maria Elena, as well as his four children help him with the farming.  They all handle everything, from thinning the seedlings, pruning, preparing the ground from the planting to the harvest.  Last year he had a total production of 7 tons which he delivered to the Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco association of which he is a member.  They process and export the coffee.  For next year Felipe De Jes\u00fas is planning on producing 9 tons and he has already planted new seedlings which will soon bear fruit.  For this goal he needs to buy fertilizer and that is why he is requesting a loan.

However, the shortage of water supply for her rice farm remains the main challenge for her family. \r\n\r\nThis is the first cycle for Arng while it is the second cycle for her group member. She and her co-member are requesting a loan of 300,000 KHR and 1,000,000 KHR, respectively. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy fertilizer for farmland and she hopes to grow her rice healthily so that she can earn more income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1132349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T18:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T18:00:26Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":512505,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118589,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":102501,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265602,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":717507,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T19:53:53Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:05:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444058,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cuando Vicente ten\u00eda 20 a\u00f1os se compr\u00f3 un terreno para poder producir caf\u00e9, pues desde peque\u00f1o su padre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a trabajar con este cultivo a \u00e9l y sus hermanos.

The improvements are also required by law, as the production site must meet all requirements and regulations for bakeries to be licensed. In the past, she has already taken a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq to renew her shop and work area, and she is now taking a new loan to continue making the required improvements. With the loan, she will be able to bring the shop once again to the standard level required by law.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor and thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElsa operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it, making a little profit. Her products are decorative plastic flowers, plants, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more decorative plastic flowers and plants to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElsa hopes to expand soon. She dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She also dreams of having her own house and lot someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.

With the first loan from Yehu Microfinance she intends to acquire them.

They farmed coffee and, over time, learned new ways to farm that made their jobs easier and increased their yields.  Francisco, 53, and his wife, Virgilia, have 4 children.  The children, too, have learned farming, the only source of employment here.  Francisco is applying for a loan that he will use to buy fertilizer for his farm.  He wants to increase production from his next crop to something more than the 10.5 tons that he produced last time.  He knows that he can produce something closer to 13 tons next year.

She left farming for several years and it was only when she married her husband, Isaac, a coffee farmer, that she decided to pick up where she left off.  She still runs her household, but she spends the rest of her time on the farm, working to provide for her family.  She used to grow coffee the convential way but thanks to advice from the team at \"Union Regional de Huatusco\", she now knows how to grow coffee organically.  She only grows organic coffee now and says that it fetches a better price at market and is better for the environment.  Paulina and her husband produced 6 tons of coffee last year and they know that in 2 years--if they sow more plants and buy fertilizer--they'll be able to produce 8 tons.  They also need to prepare their land for the next crop to ensure a good yield.  Paulina is applying for a loan that she will use to buy the supplies she needs for the farm.

However, she has insufficient working capital to meet her customers\u2019 demand for fruit, vegetables, cheese, and whey.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with Yehu Microfinance.

She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonila is hoping to be able to expand soon and to increase the number of her loyal customers.

Her market is located in the neighborhood where she lives and is aimed at serving the surrounding areas, where little by little she is becoming better known for the quality of the food and drinks she offers and for the freshness of her fruit and base ingredients, and also because her business is located across from a very popular fast food business operating in the area, which boosts her sales.\r\n\r\nShe needs to purchase input materials at a better price and in larger quantities, so that she can become more competitive. Actually, her working capital is her greatest challenge in achieving her productivity goal. This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan, which she will use to purchase oil, corn, sugar, salt, and other ingredients in cash and in larger quantities than usual.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan will be a successful investment because it is aimed at increasing her business' productivity and competitive capability, so that she can gradually expand and generate a sustainable income that will provide for her young children's well-being.

She is a mother to her children and is married to Elpidio, her business partner.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNorafil operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNorafil dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She also hopes to have her own food stall someday.

Elvin was unemployed and did not have an educational degree.  When he got married he needed a financial resource to support his new family so he started his business. \r\n\r\nWithin two years Elvin gained enough skills and experience to run the business, thanks to his father`s experience. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \r\n\r\nPeople use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy.  Many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma.  Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and also make fresh punch. Elvin usually sells his crops in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 120 AZN.\r\n\r\nAs his products are in high demand, Elvin wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand and to increase his monthly income. For this purpose he has applied for a loan of 1000 AZN.

She works in a garment factory, where she operates a winding machine. She has a sick elderly mother who is suffering from cancer. It is extremely expensive to buy medical treatment for her. Her mother lives under the care of Roziya's younger brother, but he can barely support his wife and children. So Roziya decided to help him get treatment for their mother. She will use this loan to pay for clinical services and medical procedures. Her salary will be enough to cover the entire loan, since in her family all of the expenses are being borne by her eldest son, who works as an auto mechanic at the bus

The best liquor in the province and in all of Ecuador is distilled here. \r\n\r\nThis is a group of people who decided to come together and form a Communal Bank, which has benefited them greatly, since with the loans they have been able to improve their small businesses. They are employed in diverse activities, such as business, the services, and food sales, among others. \r\n\r\nIn this place, we met Letty. She is 41 years old and is in a common-law marriage from which she has four children \u2013 one adult and three others ages 16, 12, and 10 years, who are still in school. Her husband works in agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn order to earn an income and help her husband with the household expenses, some years ago our friend assisted him in constructing a small farmyard where they raise pigs. Little by little, they also built a small chicken coop. She tells us that this has allowed them to help their children with school expenses. She buys the animals when they are young, raises them for three months, and later delivers them to merchants in the local market; her children and husband help her out. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of food and medications for both the chickens and the pigs. She has been with the Communal Bank since its inception, and she likes it because of the assistance that the bank offers her. Her dream is that her children will have a good education.

Unfortunately, not long ago there was a fire in her shop that destroyed a portion of her inventory and her refrigerator. With the goal of restoring her inventory and equipment, Buazhar has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 soms (KGS).

They still maintain the culture and traditions of the region's native peoples.\r\n\r\nSilvia is thirty-six years old and married with three children of thirteen, ten, and one year(s) of age. Her oldest son has a disability for which he receives stimulation, and her second child, a daughter, is studying in a little school in the city. Her husband is a chauffeur by profession and lends his services driving a unit of taxis. They do not have their own home, and so live in her mother's house, with whom they share expenses.\r\n\r\nSilvia finds herself enjoying good health, though she is worried about her son, whose health is delicate, which augments the risks of his disability.\r\n \r\nSilvia makes her living selling cosmetics, a business she has maintained for the past six years.

She is the mother of 5 children and married to Antonio, a vendor. By the grace of God, Albina has managed to support her older children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to college and to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlbina operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other products of the like. One of the products is belts, but what she focuses on selling right now are kitchen utensils. Customers are attracted to buy from her due to the low prices and the many options they are offered. Albina's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 25,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAlbina dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all the hard work on her business. She also hopes to expand her business.

She is in the business of cultivating rice to help her husband generate income. She is 36 years old and has three school-aged children, all of whom are in need of daily allowances. Bang works at the rice field in both the rainy season and dry season. She typically earns around USD 2.00 per day. She has been in this for 12 years.\r\n\r\nBang doesn\u2019t own a vehicle for use in the family, so she wants to borrow a loan from HKL, one of Kiva's partners, to purchase a used motorcycle for household use. This will help the family with their personal transportation.

He is married to Evangeline, a businesswoman, and is the father of four children, of whom three are in elementary school and one is in high school. By the grace of God, Fredelito has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to send them to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Fredelito, as he himself has been a college graduate, and he believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nFredelito operates a buy and sell business, specifically, diapers. What he basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell it piecemeal to make a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other products of the like, but as mentioned earlier, he focuses on selling diapers. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options offered. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operating his business, he is requesting a loan of 50,000 pesos. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantity and variety of products to expand his inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nFredelito dreams of being able to give his children a good and high-quality education through all his hard work on his business. He is hoping to be able to expand soon and to increase the number of his loyal customers. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week. At these meetings, he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1133077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for

Sadly, owing to her need to work and cover her costs, Elka was not able to study for a degree.  She would really like to have been able to study for a degree in veterinary medicine.

She has a small plot of land where she grows beans.  From very early in the morning, Elka carries out her farm work.

He lives with his wife and his three children in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. Before he was a herder and used to herd sheep, horse and cows in the countryside. But his family moved to the city due to the heavy freezes of consecutive years in Mongolia. His family owns an old house and small land plot in the ger district. A ger is a Mongolian nomadic tent. Since his house was built, it never had any complete repair or renovations. Currently it looses a lot of heat through the old floor, ceiling and entrance hall. This is why he has decided to make repairs and insulate them. He totally hopes that his cost for coal fuel will be cut after the repair. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to cover the costs for his house repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1133155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Lkhasuren, 37, works as a driver in a private company. He lives with his family in his recently purchased house and land plot in the ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His house has some problems such as heat loss and damages to its roof, inside walls etc. This is why he is planning to make repairs and insulate them using rock wool, cement and red bricks. Also he will replace his furnace which uses smoky coal with a smokeless one. He thinks his home will be warmer after the wall and roof insulation and a new smart furnace. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reason of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy the cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to buy some building materials and new smokeless furnace for his home repair."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1133138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy some building materials and a new smokeless furnace for his home repair.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-07-08T11:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-07T11:10:12Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lkhasuren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34000},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49154.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49162.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":48069.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":52833.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":51965.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":53361.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":57815.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56348.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56955.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61109.64},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61840.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61944.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65058.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66750.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":67901.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":70251.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":70685.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":74318.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":76524.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77565.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79649.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81924.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74809.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1502437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369478,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-26T10:26:01Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444174,"name":"Erika Jazmin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Nueva Esperanza  se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en la parroquia Calder\u00f3n del cant\u00f3n Portoviejo, lugar de gente noble y trabajadora dedicada en su mayor\u00eda a las faenas del campo y el comercio.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a Erika, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 soltera y vive en casa de sus padres.

Also, she has her child to help her in the two businesses.\r\n\r\nChum wants to earn a consistent income for her child\u2019s education. In this regard, she has applied for a loan of KHR 800,000 to purchase seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for growing her dry-season rice. She hopes that lenders will continually help her through the loan for the improvements of her business. She believes that she will have a good harvest in the coming crop season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1130096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for growing her dry-season rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-07-08T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-07T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294368839,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301422046,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182417,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315413694,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323018998,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155257,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540256,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347090455,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355834763,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-25T08:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":81980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364543614,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-08T12:56:01Z","paid_date":"2013-05-25T08:45:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446367,"name":"Simeona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Simeona.

","en":"Rafoat is a married woman, who has two children, one daughter and one son. Her husband works as a salesman for men's shoes at the local market, while she works as a head nurse at a polyclinic. \r\n\r\nRafoat has had credit with the organization for three years already, and the two previous loans she used for her son's and her daughter's weddings.

Her goal is to always offer fresh fruits and vegetables, which requires more business capital daily, since fruits and vegetables are very expensive. Corn, which she sells to local women who make tortillas, is also very expensive.

of 46 years of age, married, and has three children, out of which two are students. Aziz works as an engineer at a factory, and his monthly income barely is enough for daily life. His wife works as a teacher, and a teacher's salary is also small. Therefore they can never save up money for repair of their apartment. \r\n\r\nIn order to do repairs they need a large sum of money, and they don't have this amount. After having learned about the loans from a friend, Aziz decided to turn to us for a loan. He is happy that he can restore his apartment and stepwise repay the loan received with the family's incomes.
