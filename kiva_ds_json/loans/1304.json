is a freshman in the Psychology Program. This is his story:\r\n\r\nMy sister graduated from AUCA, so I know a little more than most freshman about this university. I had opportunities to meet with her friends and people who studied there. I found out that these students are really smart and successful, and really loved to study. Now they are all successful, and I know that I want to follow in their path.\r\n\r\nI would like to study psychology to know and understand people's behavior and mental processes. It is interesting for me the way people behave in similar situations, and how they can be influenced by environmental and other conditions. I want to understand what factors help shape and define who we are and find out what motivates the behavior and decisions of individuals. After I graduate I want to be a psychotherapist and my dream is to help people to understand their problems.\r\n\r\nStudents in AUCA are hardworking and eager to study and to be successful. It is important for me to surround myself with people who have the same desire to study as I have. The other things that I like at AUCA are the extracurricular activities. I like the social and volunteer groups, because volunteers show people how to do good things as well as love and respect the people around them.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1493097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She was born under the roof of a loving family with strong principles.  From a young age she has always dreamt of being a nurse.  She is a girl who throws herself into something she is interested in, the well-being of others.  She would take pleasure in caring for them, caring for the patients and for herself, to manage to get a nice moment in life.  They could forget their illness for a minute and find a moment of relief and tranquility.\r\n\r\nDiana wants to be a nurse.  More than doing it for a salary or a paycheck, she is doing it as a calling.  Unfortunately, Diana was born to a family that, in spite of being loving, does not have enough financial resources to pay for a degree of this type.  Diana hasn\u2019t turned away from her dream of being a nurse because if she can dream it, she can make it come true.  No dream is only a dream.  She felt that something must be done to begin, so she decided to become a nurse technician.  In this way she can reach her final goal, because she was always a great student.  She couldn\u2019t allow her life to end with high school, so she looked for the best choice for making it happen: Campo Alto.  So, she adjusted the expectations that she had.  In spite of being an excellent school with the authority to do the training and adjusting itself to her budget, she still needed financial aid.  So she found herself needing to look for work to support herself and be able to reach her dreams: ending up as an excellent nurse who is always on the move and motivated from her love for her work and for her patients, making a nicer life for them."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for registration for a semester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T03:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T03:30:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T04:23:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658601,"name":"Zubaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zubaida is a 31-year-old married woman who has been running a business selling milk for many years.

These profits will be partially reinvested into her business in order to expand it and the rest will allow her to meet her family's needs.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to increase her grocery stock and to refurbish her premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17394},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18019},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18645},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19270},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19895},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20521},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21146},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21771},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22397},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23022},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23647},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24273}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T09:34:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657428,"name":"Leyla","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0435 52 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u041b\u0435\u0439\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d -\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0445, \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0443. \u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435. \u0423 \u041b\u0435\u0439\u043b\u044b -

Her husband died from an illness, and Leyla raised the children by herself.  The oldest son is a shepherd and takes local residents' livestock to pasture for a set payment.  The second son works in Kazakhstan, and the daughter attends a technical college.  Leyla has a secondary education, and to provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 28 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Leyla's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 heifer, 5 sheep and also a 3.60 hectare land plot, where she grows clover, beans and barley.

She is currently in her early 30s. Since 2003, Rose has been managing a poultry business (broiler chickens). She starts her business early at 6:00 am until 07:00 pm per working day and is able to make a fair monthly profit. <br \/><br \/>From Tujijenge Tanzania, this is her ninth loan request, which she will use to buy chicks for her business. Rose expects to buy more chicks in the coming months so as to make her business grow and manage her expenses. She used her previous loans to maintain her number of chicks and bought the chicks food. Rose is a good customer of Tujijenge who has paid all of her previous loans successfully. With her business profit, she built a house to rent.

With the aim of further developing her farm, Zura turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to purchase steers for fattening with the subsequent sale at the market at a premium. <br \/><br \/>Zura plans to invest income from the loan in further propagating the quantity of domestic animals, and intends to save money to purchase an apartment for her son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1492102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy steers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Korumdu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-19T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":613.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-19T15:48:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646667,"name":"Lira","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041b\u0438\u0440\u0435 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 -\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0423 \u041b\u0438\u0440\u044b -

qu\u00edmicos que manejaban en esa empresa  le dio una enfermedad que no tenia cura, \u00e9l empez\u00f3 a enfrentarse a una realidad de  preocupaci\u00f3n y angustia por que el ver sufrir a la madre le impactaba mucho, y las diferencias  que ella viv\u00eda con el padre que nunca  ha vivido con ellos y  nunca le import\u00f3 la vida de ellos.\nCuando \u00e9l ten\u00eda 8 a\u00f1os, al hermano mayor falleci\u00f3, para la mam\u00e1 fue muy dif\u00edcil enfrentarse a esta situaci\u00f3n, despu\u00e9s de esto ella lloraba todos los d\u00edas, pero a pesar de todo ella fue muy fuerte y a los

sucedi\u00f3.\nLa madre falleci\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2010 y para el hermano mellizo y para \u00e9l ha sido muy dif\u00edcil superar la muerte de la \u00fanica persona que los apoyaba emocionalmente y econ\u00f3micamente. \nHace seis meses empezaron a estudiar en campo alto y  han tenido una sumatoria de valores agregados que se les han implantado all\u00ed, para ellos ha sido de gran ayuda estudiar en campo alto, han tenido un acercamiento en conocimientos los cuales los est\u00e1n motivando a tener metas que cumplir y culminar los estudios  con  entusiasmo y disciplina.\nSe les ha dificultado en cuesti\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica  el pago mensual de los estudios por eso ellos agradecen la colaboraci\u00f3n de kiva para tener la posibilidad de un subsidio en la matricula.\n","en":"Yeison Camilo is 20 and lives in the city of Bogot\u00e1.  He is one of three children and as he was growing up he realized how difficult the economic situation was for his mother, his twin brother and his eldest brother, who passed away.\r\n\r\nHis mother was 40 when he was born.  Her name was Graciela and she also passed away.  She used to work for a flower company but became ill after working there a long time.  The chemicals she handled in the company were blamed for her illness which had no cure.  Yeison Camilo had to face reality and became worried and anxious on seeing how much his mother suffered.  She also had a bad relationship with his father who never lived with them and never cared for them.\r\n\r\nWhen he was eight years old, his eldest brother died.  It was difficult for his mother to face this situation and she would weep every day.  But she was very strong and able to provide for her twin boys, getting them through grade school and high school before she died.\r\n\r\nMost of their lives, they lived in rental property and it was hard for his mother to pay the rent and support the children.  She was very responsible and paid the bills and stretched her income to support the two boys.  She gave them values and told them never to let bad friendships influence them.  There was a limit and they had to establish the parameters.\r\n\r\nThanks to his mother's efforts and God's help, they were able to finish high school.  Despite the economic difficulties, their mother always taught them how to lead a decent life through education, which she believed would make life easier.  \r\n\r\nYeison Camilo's mother passed away in 2010, and it has been very difficult for him and his twin brother to overcome the death of the only person who supported them both emotionally and economically.\r\n\r\nSix months ago they began their university studies which has given them even more values.  The access to knowledge motivates them to go on to finish a career with enthusiasm and discipline.\r\n\r\nThe monthly payment of school tuition has become difficult though, so they are grateful to Kiva for a loan to pay for tuition.\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1513146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for a semester of tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T09:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T09:50:15Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yeison Camilo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":725000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T12:22:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646214,"name":"Lluvia De Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupo formado por cuatro socias luchadoras una de ellas es Ninoska tiene la edad de 28 a\u00f1os, acompa\u00f1da, con dos hijos, su negocio es la venta de artesan\u00eda, plantas de rosas, caramelos desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, sus productos los comercializa en los diferentes departamentos como Boaco, Granada.

However, his parents taught him to work and to be a responsible person.

His entire life has been linked to agriculture and cattle. It is in his blood and how he has managed all this time to give his family what they need so that they lack nothing. His children have been able to study and will be be able to apply for jobs thanks to the sacrifice of Jos\u00e9 and his wife.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nElma operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP (Philippines pesos) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nElma dreams that her business will just continue and hopes that her children will have a good life and education.

Two of the children still live at home while the other has a partner.\r\n\r\nFrancisco currently makes a living sowing corn and sorghum, work that he has done since he was a child.

Apart from this work, Francisco also makes a living buying and selling pigs, and, in addition, he has a small shop in his house. Francisco gets up at 4am in order to get out to the countryside, out to his cornfields. He travels 6km by bicycle to get to work. Francisco does not have a time when he clocks out - he just works until he has done everything he needs to and then returns home.

She resides in a small house with her husband, one son of 16 years and one daughter of 12 years in a rural village named Chindaguda in the Nuapada district in Odisha, India.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years, Gitanjali has run a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time, her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult on her part to maintain the family. So she, with four other women of her village, formed a Joint Liability group named Jay Sriram to avail loans from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nTo date she has already availed three loans of 10,000, 14000 and 28,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation and has been able to expand her business. Now she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. As per the statement of Gitanjali, this small income is not at all sufficient to manage the family along with educational expenses of her children, so she wants to increase her income by expansion of her existing business. \r\n\r\nShe has planned to use the loan amount to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and  enough savings that she will be able to construct a house for her family, which is a dream for her, and give better education to the children. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Sushama, Himadri, Jasobanti and Labanidei, who are running milk selling, computer center, and vegetable vending businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"CHINDAGUDA, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-18T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-17T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gitanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Himadri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasobanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Labanidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":152000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":152000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T01:18:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647324,"name":"Teodoro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teodoro is 44, married, and has children.
