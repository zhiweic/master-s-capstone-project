and farming rice for ten years. She is 28 years old and has three children, all of whom are still in school. From the business, her family earns around four US dollars per day.

In addition, at night she sells hamburgers and fried fast food at her doorstep thus obtaining extra profits.\r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing profits she plans for the near future to start raising the chickens herself to sell the meat and this way not have to buy them from other farms.  She will also start to raise guinea pigs since guinea pig meat is consumed very much in her zone.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cLas Mujeres Del \u00c9xito\u201d (Women of Success) group and this is her first MFP loan.  She is grateful for the support she\u2019s getting because she acquires the working capital she needs to work and make business progress.  She promises to be punctual with her installment payments because the members of her association are supportive, responsible people.\r\n\r\nSoledad will use the requested money to buy more chickens to sell their meat.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1094912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She specializes in school uniforms and has gradually built up a clientele of educational institutions.  As a a result, she has earned recognition.  The idea for her business was conceived in 2010 when a friend convinced her to start her own business since had already acquired 20 years of experience working in various sewing factories.  Her main product lines include dresses, uniforms, school clothes, sportswear, and daily wear.  Her goal moving forward is to be well-structured so that she can generate better earnings and jobs for her children.  Her greatest challenge is not having sufficient operating capital to expand her business by purchasing tools and equipment since these items are becoming more sophisticated all the time.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to resolve this problem, Cleofelina is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy a sewing machine that will improve her production process and result in better-quality work, especially with dresses and uniforms.  This will make an impact on her market of existing customers and will help her to acquire new ones.

This, he says, will be invaluable as he goes about his expansion plan. Before he started running his mobile money transfers business, Mundia served his community as a police officer and worked with a local bank as a team sales leader.  He describes himself as persistent and hardworking. These qualities have helped him keep running his business.\r\n\r\nBeing one of the first people to start running a mobile money transfer business through Mobile Transactions Zambia (MTZ), Mundia has grown his business from scratch. He recalls that when he first started, he would only have five customers a day, which is a far cry from the 100+ who now transact with him on a daily basis.  He has since managed to employ four people who help him attend to customers.\r\n\r\nMundia believes that the Kiva loan will help him alleviate his major challenge of having low working capital. He would like to use the money to open more outlets in his province as he is convinced that more people are in need of sending and receiving money instantly and cheaply. His expanded business will help more members of the community access this service.\r\n\r\nHe has high hopes of becoming the biggest Mobile money agent in the western province. Opening up more outlets will give Mundia more profits, which  will help him provide a better life for his wife and children.\r\n\r\nIn the video, a representative from Mobile Transactions is interviewing Mundia.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1100276,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2589,"youtubeId":"kHPI9NrqhG8","title":"Kiva Borrower Mundia from Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1100276},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To open another mobile money shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Mongu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-05-22T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-21T20:40:05Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":183,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mundia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":26000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":769.23,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480102,"comment":null},{"amount":961.54,"local_amount":5000000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533512,"comment":null},{"amount":769.23,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-30T08:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308301574,"comment":null},{"amount":961.54,"local_amount":5000000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533412,"comment":null},{"amount":1538.46,"local_amount":8000000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132514,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T05:25:03Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":10,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":429200,"name":"Linda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Linda operates a grocery shop at Edukrom near Cape Coast.

Vilma is a very hard-working, earnest woman who makes a living as a cacao, coffee, and fruit farmer. She began her work as a farmer 13 years ago, and she has much experience. During the harvest seasons, she hires additional laborers to harvest the crops on her land. After harvesting, she takes her crops to the collection center where she is paid per kilogram of produce. \r\n\r\nAccording to Vilma, the most rewarding part of her job is obtaining good harvests after lots of hard work. The most difficult part of her job, however, is transporting the heavy sacks of produce to the collection centers.

of vegetables, such as eggplants, corn and melon crops - watermelons.  Elena's family is her disabled husband and 24 year-old son, Vyacheslav, who helps with the farming work.  She has problems with watering because it is very hard to water 40 sotkas of land at the same time.  This is why the family decided to purchase equipment for irrigation, which will increase the harvest-ability and ease human labor.  Elena's plans include expansion of her business, planting strawberries and potatoes and purchasing motorized equipment for plowing the soil.  Elena's personal plans include providing medical care for her disabled husband.

His clients are locals or from the cities that come to him only to buy olive and make olive pickles and organic olive oil for their only use. Kindly note here, that Albanians consume large quantities of olive pickles and oil, therefore, the demand is high. Some other clients are olive oil producers who buy olives to generate profit out of them.

a fifty-four-year-old man and a father of two young daughters, nine and six years old, lived in the countryside up to January of this year when they relocated to a little town in central Albania with a population of approximately 10,000 people. Upon arriving in the town, Spiro realized that there were no stores selling construction supplies and there were large construction projects going on building rental and condominiums, and main roads also.  Many people like himself from villages around were moving to the city and had started building houses.

His stall is in an accesible business area, and his primary customers are local residents.\r\n\r\nJaphesa also provides transportation to customers using his motorcycle.

They live together in Santo Domingo which is the fourth most populous city in Ecuador after Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca (the most important cities of the country.)

Its normal temperature is 25.5 Celsius (80 Fahrenheit) and sometimes reaches 38 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit). All the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas forms part of the mountainous territory of the coast, of the western mountain range, historically known as Province of Yumbos and Capital de los Colibr\u00edes.

She works 6 hours daily traversing the streets of the city where she lives. It is hard work because she walks a lot with a backpack carrying her merchandise that is heavy. Diana wants to invest in merchandise since the sale of shoes requires an inventory of a variety of sizes and colors. For this reason she is resorting to a loan in order to invest in merchandise. With this she is hoping to have higher earnings and more sales. She dreams of having her own shoe store as she likes this work, and in the future to be able to give her children a home where they can live more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1095404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is a driven and eager individual who loves nothing more than being his own boss, while also providing a needed service to the community around him. A few years ago, he saw the need for more handicap accessible ramps in businesses and homes around him. Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, he sees his field as essential and one that will only become more necessary in the coming years. The ramps that his company builds are all customized to the building and built on location. This way every ramp fits in structurally and environmentally. To build these ramps in his area of Minnesota because of how spread out his contracts are, it is essential for him to have a truck to transport the parts to each site. However, recently he has been having problems with his truck. This loan would help him repair his truck so he can continue to provide for his customers within a vast area. Robert aspires to continue to build this business in the future with the hopes of employing more people and the ongoing goal of making his community handicap accessible for people with various disabilities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3477.72,"image":{"id":1089035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

","en":"Ana is 62 years old and lives in the city of Barranquilla where she sells lunches and homemade food from her restaurant. She is separated with three children and has been involved with commercial activities since she was very young. \r\n\r\nBefore getting married, Ana worked in a municipality on the border of Colombia, where she worked for 22 years in a store and gained the majority of her business experience. With her current business she has been able to provide her children with an education and bring them ahead in life. She acquired two homes and thus addressed her biggest challenges before moving to Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nIn Barranquilla Ana has had various businesses, including selling stuffed arepas in a busy pedestrian area. She worked this business during night hours and in rough weather, and in addition it was located very far from her home so she wore herself out and decided to change activity. She rented a space where she began selling lunches, and she is still there two years later. \r\n\r\nAna's main customers are taxi drivers, masons, and passersby. She has one employee whom she pays daily. Ana works from very early in the morning until 3 pm and sells every day for cash. Her business infrastructure is made up of an industrial stove, six sets of tables, a fridge, and metal shelving. \r\n\r\nAnna is applying for her first Kiva loan, which is also her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan she will purchase in bulk ingredients such as rice, grains, sugar, and meat for making lunches. This loan will be a success because through buying in bulk, Ana will be able to reduce her costs and thus be more competitive in the market.

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

","en":"Yira is a 32-year-old married woman.  She has an 11-year-old daughter who she dreams of seeing become a successful woman.  Her daughter is her motivation for living, as well as her husband's.  Yira has her own business in which she sells various merchandise such as comforters, women's clothing, sporting goods, and other items.  Yira completed her high school education early.  At the age 16, she began her technical career as an entry-level bank employee.  She was able to transfer her knowledge into a job for a private company.  Two years later, she decided to help her husband with his business in the retail sector.  Yira also started her own line of businesses selling detailed items to a customer base that has gradually increased.  At the moment, her goal to keep growing has not stopped and neither has the growth of her clientele.  However, her operating capital is not sufficient for supporting her dream of obtaining more customers.  For this reason, Yira is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy comforters, shoes, household decor products, women's accessories, and other affordable items.  These items will be purchased in a city along the Colombian border.  \r\n<p>\r\nAfter being adjusted according to the type of business she operates, Yira's financial indicators shows that her accounts receivable period is 16 days, her product rotation period is 7 days, and her sales profitability is no less than 30%.  Due to these financial reasons, it is projected that the investment of her Kiva loan will result in successful growth.

Otgonjargal, forty-four, runs a grocery store in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. She lives with her parents-in-law and her husband and two children in her new house. Her husband plants vegetables in their backyard for their private use. She and her husband built a new house in 2010 and some decoration and building parts still have not been completed due to the lack of funding. Previously, they used to live in a ger, a Mongolian traditional nomadic tent. Usually a ger is cold and uncomfortable to live in for big families. \r\n\r\nOtgonjargal needs a loan to buy a heated-floor rather than using one of the smoky and harmful coal furnaces. These cost too much, especially in winter time. Coal usage creates a lot of air pollution and is toxic to the air in the cities of Mongolia. In last several years, air pollution and air quality has become one of the biggest issues in most Mongolian households and big cities. \r\n\r\nOtgonjargal is also planning to use some part of her loan to increase the groceries in her grocery store.

She hopes this loan will enable her to make more money so that she can have enough to finance her children's education until they finish school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1101898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seedlings and fertilizers for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-05-23T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-22T17:20:08Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Danak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ran","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vita","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288452,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1001750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265520,"comment":null},{"amount":550,"local_amount":2200000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2203850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841096,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T01:15:08Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":429743,"name":"Memsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Memsa is a woman with five children, married to Bakari, who repairs bicycles.

At this time, she is working hard to provide income continually for their everyday expenses.\r\nMarilou operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Marilou earns profits by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nMarilou hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. The fellowship group is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

What she likes about her business is that it allows for two incomes; one is fixed in the home-based studio and the other is when she goes to various events by request.  At the start, like all entrepreneurs, she had difficulties and fears but with time she became settled in her work and now she\u2019s very good and renowned for what she does.

is Sarah, 63, a resident of Malibay, Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Wilfredo, a driver. Sarah is a mother of one child. By the grace of God, Sarah has managed to support her child's schooling up to college level, a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Sarah. Since Sarah herself has been an undergraduate, she believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\nSarah operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nSarah dreams of being able to see her child finish college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1101799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-05-23T18:40:55Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-22T18:40:55Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2167.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095758,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359374,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303189,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2889.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301355913,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-23T19:58:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":429807,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 30-year-old business lady in Kilifi.

This is 39 year old Suzan from Harare, Machipisa. She is married and has three children, two attending school. Suzan runs a clothing business selling clothes and footwear. The business has been in operation for 2 years. She says the main challenge she faces is not having a proper shelter for doing business.

has four children; 20, 17, 15 and 13 years of age. The oldest one study in university and three of them are attending the secondary school. Dilore and her husband have been in the livestock business for over seventeen years. They are passionate about the whole process: raising cattle and producing cheese, cottage cheese and butter. \nTheir business was doing very well, especially over the past almost five years. They sold dairy products and cattle in small cities and villages around their living location. Unfortunately, this past winter, the snow and extreme cold hit North Albania very harsh and thousands of animals died including Dilore's cows. \nThe demand for dairy products is high throughout Albania, thus, like many others who are involved in the same business, they were fortunate enough to generate some income through it. With that money they were able to feed the children and build a house and improve living conditions. When Dilore started describing the living conditions they were in before, she became very emotional.\nNow, she plans to add three more cows to the once they already have and build a little stable so that animals no longer live outside during the cold and snowy winters. This is the fourth time that Dilore is applying for a loan. Thanks to her responsible actions, she remains an excellent client of VFA.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1097393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Fue fundada como un peque\u00f1o pueblo rural a fines del siglo XIX, pero dado su crecimiento demogr\u00e1fico es actualmente una de las comunas con mayor poblaci\u00f3n de Chile, superando los 600 mil habitantes. Es la puerta de entrada a uno de los sectores precordilleranos de la regi\u00f3n Metropolitana, conocido como el Caj\u00f3n del Maipo, sector con espacios de caminatas, cabalgatas, rafting, entre otras actividades y servicios de alojamiento y alimentaci\u00f3n.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cEsperanza para Todos\u201d (Hope for All) and it has 22 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of lines of work among which are: fried potato sales, plant sales, clothes sales, fruit and vegetable sales, snacks, personal hygiene products, kiosk and services among others.  All belong to the city of Santiago\u2019s Puente Alto commune.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda, communal bank secretary, is in the first row seated in the first place from right to left.  She\u2019s wearing blue pants and a black vest; her hair is gathered.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a merchant specifically selling cleaning supplies.  She\u2019s been in this business for a year and works alone in a stand in a street market.  She buys her merchandise at a cleaning supplies store.  She will use the loan to buy merchandise for her business.  Her goal is to be able to open a home-based business to generate higher income.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives with her husband who works alongside her and her two children who are 11 and 8 years old.  Her dream is to grow with her business and that her daughter continues forward with her schooling.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is very happy and grateful with the loan and services gotten from Fondo Esperanza.  She also comments that she feels very comfortable at the meetings and with her communal bank because there is generosity and unity there.\r\n\r\nPuente Alto is a commune in north Santiago, Capital of Chile.  It was founded as a small rural village at the end of the 19th-century but due to population growth is now one of Chile\u2019s most populous communes with more than 600,000 inhabitants.  It\u2019s the doorway to one of the metropolitan region\u2019s foothill areas known as Caj\u00f3n del Maipo, a sector with hiking trails, bridal paths and rafting, among other activities as well as accommodations and food services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7000,"image":{"id":1078237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

It is an attractive place to live as there are various monuments dispersed throughout the city, including the \"Monumento al Indio Colorado\" (a monument honoring the indigenous people of the area) and an area known as the \u201cY del Colorado\u201d.  Santo Domingo is an exceptional Canton full of marvelous, hardworking and enterprising people who work tirelessly for development and progress.  They welcome tourists with open arms and introduce them to their marvelous culture and environment.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Gloria opened an office supply store which carries some other miscellaneous items.  She is open everyday for 8 hours and has her daughter's help.  This last year has gone well for her, and the income from the store has allowed her to have a modest lifestyle.  Despite occasional shortages, she and her daughter have learned to keep moving forward.  Because the primary and secondary schools in the coastal region are starting up, Gloria has decided to invest in school supplies.  There is a lot of demand for them, especially at this time.  This enterprising woman will make use of the loan to purchase merchandise for her store and to therefore have a better income which will allow her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nLife has not been easy for this woman.  It is difficult to raise a daughter alone.  Even though she owns her own home, Gloria hopes to fix it up to give her daughter a more comfortable life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1096347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to
