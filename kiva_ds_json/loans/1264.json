","en":"Akmaljon is a positive and responsible forty-year-old man. He is married and has three children. He lives with his family in a small village. However, the house in which they live is too small and poorly built. Akmaljon's wife is a very hardworking woman and caring mother. Akmaljon  works buying and selling cars, and his wife has a small sewing shop in the local market. This is how they earn their living. The money they make is just enough to live. But they dream of building a large house for their family. But to do that, they need the money. The fact is, they do not earn enough to build a new home. Therefore, Akmaljon has asked Arvand for a loan to buy building materials to build a house. Akmaljon and his wife are hoping for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

However, the mere act of submitting her paperwork to apply for a loan makes her happy and optimistic, since other people would be helping her to fulfil the dreams and goals which she has set out in life.

Abrahan is currently attending the Universidad Juan Misael Saracho working towards his degree in computer engineering. He plans on graduating in April 2014, but he fears that he will need to defer his graduation without a loan from Vittana.\n\nWith this loan, Abrahan plans on purchasing his much needed textbooks and school supplies. With the proper books, Abrahan feels he will be able to study more effectively and earn better grades. In addition to his responsibilities at school, Abrahan currently works 30 hours a week as a computer technician to help cover his school and living expenses. With a career in computer engineering, he expects to earn $32 a day. \n\nUnfortunately, Abrahan's parents never had the opportunity to complete their high school education. Without the opportunity for a higher degree, his parents never had the chance to move up. Abrahan's father works as a driver and his salary is the family's primary source of income. Growing up, finances have always been tight. With three other siblings, Abrahan is unsure how he will be able to finance his education without help.

Shazia felt it obligatory to change her family\u2019s living standards and started working from home.

She was born in the city of Latacunga in the Province of Cotopaxi, whose people have a great reputation across Ecuador for their strong work ethic. Ver\u00f3nica's husband works in another canton, so they rarely see each other, but Ver\u00f3nica's mother gave the couple an apartment in her home and the family lives there. \r\n\r\nThe lack of opportunity to work is the greatest obstacle Ver\u00f3nica has faced, so she's had to seek other sources of income. She works as a teacher in a rural school in Latacunga, but also started a business selling clothes at street markets on the advice of family members and friends. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica's ambition and her wish is to provide an education and a better standard of living for her children so they won't want for anything in the future. She needs a loan to invest in new merchandise for the Christmas season and thus increase her income.  \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica and her husband would like to express their sincere thanks and best wishes to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa [Alternative Foundation] in Ecuador and to Kiva for making their professional and personal growth possible.

is a first-year student of the American University of Central Asia, department of Business Administration. Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best way to make a career is to work out a plan. I always dreamt about good career and to become a businessman or manager of a big company. But I realized that it is not easy to become successful businessman. It is necessary to have personal qualities, such as hard workmanship, courage, leadership, ability to work in a team, make decision in difficult situations, be responsible for ones acts. I am confident that the knowledge and skills gained in AUCA will be invaluable contribution to make my dream happen. I was studying at local school in Balykchy. Later I applied and was accepted to the Turkish lyceum in Karakol, where i have been studying for the past five years. I had a good opportunity to improve my language skills and deepen my knowledge of math and learn teamwork skills. I am interested and reading about various large famous companies, about how they were created, how they reached success, I admire those people who could open and develop own business in our unstable political situation in the country. Our country needs young professional creative and honest people, who will be able to improve everything: economics, business, agriculture and all other aspects. To my opinion this university can give me a high qualified knowledge. AUCA has good reputation that provides high quality education. AUCA gives another unique opportunity to its students, which is loan. The loan is given to all students applying for financial aid, which is given my Kiva. I am very happy that AUCA cooperates with such a great organization that gives us \u2013 students such opportunity.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1470505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

First, economics is the most important science for the countries, particularly for work of banks. Their prosperity and success lies in their activity in economy. So in my opinion the knowledge of economics is required. Economists are demanded almost everywhere. For example, in government sectors, banking and financial activity of companies and industries. I am interested in economics and I want to build my career in the field of economics. This department will give me ability to take basic knowledge of this science and will help me to be successful in future because of the high level of education of the education. So this program will give me a lot of possibilities. In general AUCA is a perfect place to start a successful career, and can be long to describe the benefits of this university.
