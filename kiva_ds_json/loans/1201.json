Then she gets ready to clean her house and wash the clothes, spending all morning on this.  Then she makes lunch for her children.\r\n\r\nThis is how Brenda's days are.  It's a job without remuneration but with the satisfaction of being with her family and living happily.\r\n\r\nThe loan she's requesting is to buy materials to improve the infrastructure of the roof on her house.  The roof has deteriorated because of the recent rains, and it's leaking.  This damages her electrical appliances and other belongings.  Thanks to the loan all these problems will be resolved and her family's quality of life will be better.\r\n\r\nBrenda's goal is to set up a store in her house and help her husband with the income.  She also wants to raise her children to be honest and responsible people with good moral values.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":159.7,"image":{"id":1419507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to improve the roof of her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenda Azucena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":54.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":60.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.73},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":38.91,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":38.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090896,"comment":null},{"amount":39.41,"local_amount":39.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":39.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856893,"comment":null},{"amount":37.23,"local_amount":37.23,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505159,"comment":null},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":44.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":44.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-03T03:02:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599469,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is 25 years old and from Nakuru, Kenya.

Her main challenges are a lack of capital and fluctuating prices. Also, customers don't pay their debts on time.\r\n\r\nSaumu seeks a loan to buy two bundles of wheat flour, maize flour and charcoal for the business.

20-year-old Mariatu from Waterloo Western rural area in Freetown. She is single with 1 child, age 5 months. She began this business because she wants to create income to support herself and her child. In 2010, Mariatu established her slippers business. She works at the business 11 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to buy more slippers to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and try to attend a vocational school. In the future, Mariatu plans to own a big shop.

Kalsaipali is a small rural village located five kilometers away from the district headquarters of Balangir.  All households of this village belong to the milkman community and their main income source is milk selling, along with cultivation. Sankar is one of the members of this group. She is standing second from the right with raised hand in the photo. She is 44 years old; living with her husband and two sons aged 18 & 12 years. \r\n\r\nSankar is running her conventional business of milk selling, having five cows. She gets 15 liters of milk per day. Her husband supplies this milk to the households of the railway colony of the town. Apart from this her family cultivates vegetables in the backyard and her elder son has been running a mobile phone repair centre at Balangir town for the last two years. From the above businesses Sankar gets a monthly income of 10,000 INR. But according to Sankar, the present income is insufficient and she faces lots of financial troubles in covering fodder expenses, investment in the mobile repair center and household expenses.  So, as there is growing demand for milk in the locality, she has planned to utilize the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety to add some extra income to her family. Sankar says this will help her to provide some financial help to her son and save some money for the construction of a house and digging a well for vegetable cultivation. Sankar has also a dream to develop a dairy farm in future.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of this group are Ulas, Surubali, Sasthi and Brundabati with similar milk businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1417201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for purchasing a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KALSAIPALI, BALANGIR, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T17:50:08Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ulas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surubali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasthi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brundabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sankar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":58000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":58000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-03T22:18:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599750,"name":"Maa Laxmi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dipanjali is 30 years old and lives in Kalsaipali village of Balangir district of Odisha, India.

Out of this income she can hardly cover her business as well as household expenses. \r\n\r\nDipanjali\u2019s husband purchases stock for her business on daily basis from the wholesalers of the nearest town of 5 kms away.

She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 200 KGS. Thanks to Kulbaira's hard work, her farm now includes one milk cow and three sheep as well as one hectare of agricultural land on which she grows barley every year. Her monthly earnings amount to 6,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further development of her farm, Kulbaira has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to augment her number of cattle by purchasing cows. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further increasing her quantity of cattle, and in addition to save for home renovations.

After several unsuccessful attempts, Ismail applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of a Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva. This program enables the vulnerable poor to start or re-start businesses. A loan of $2200 will help him to purchase a minibus, pay the duty for it, and install the seats. He will work on the minibus line and transport the passengers. The new business initiative will significantly increase the family funds.

is a student at AUCA. This is his story.\n\nMy name is Bekzat. I am from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

Since AUCA is accredited by Bard College, students get American diplomas.\n \nIt is difficult for my family to cover the tuition fee, though. My family paid for my brother to attend AUCA. It is very hard for them to find more money for my studies. As the second child, I don\u2019t have as many opportunities, but I still want the best education I can get. \n\nThe other argument would be my promise to the university that I will meet the expectations of the university. I will not limit myself only by studying, but also actively take part in the social life of AUCA. I am a creative, emotionally stable and very active person. I consider these skills very important for extracurricular activities of AUCA. I know that the university has a lot of extracurricular activities where I will have a chance to demonstrate my skills and abilities.\n\nI was a very active student at school. I was a member of pupillary senate where I got good grades, studied French and was engaged in sports.\nMy mother always talks about the importance of education. Therefore I always tried to be one of the best students at high school, which gave me a chance to enter AUCA. I would much appreciate financial support to pursue my studies.

I had excellent scores during my studies at high school and therefore I have been awarded the Diploma of Excellence each academic year. \n\nMy strong educational background gave me an opportunity to succeed in entrance exams to AUCA's Business Law Department. \n\nI also took an active part in social life: In 2005 I was attending an art school, where I learned drawing very well. In 2007 I attended at the School of Music, where I learned vocal. I also have experience in dancing, and eventually I became an instructor at one of the dancing clubs, Let\u2019s Dance Studio. As AUCA gives a good opportunity to take part in social and extracurricular activities, my experience will allow me to play an active role in it.\n\nAt our school there also was an organized club of debaters, where I took an active part. As a result I was awarded the title \u201cThe best debater of the school.\u201d\n\nI am sure all the above-mentioned experience I gained during my studies will give me an opportunity to become a valuable student at AUCA. \n\nI live in a family of four: my mother, my sister, my cousin and I. The only breadwinner of my family is my mother. She works at the Ministry of Justice. My older sister is also a student and studies at the National University of Kyrgyz Republic. Her studies are also expensive, so it would be difficult for my mother to fully cover my tuition fees. My cousin, whose mother lives and works in Moscow, also lives with us, and my mother is the one taking care of him.

is a student at AUCA. This is her story.\n\nMy name is Saadat. I have a strong desire to study at the American University of Central Asia and am happy to be enrolled in the International and Comparative Politics Department. \n\nWhen I was a child, my family moved to Bishkek. It was quite difficult for me to get used to a new school, new people and environment, although not much later I became a leader of our class and started participating in the social life of our school actively. One of those was an event called \u201cYoung Traffic Wardens.\u201d It was the most interesting activity I was ever involved in, because I was the leader of that team and had to make decisions quickly, which was a very good experience for me. \n\nI took part in another project called \u201cEfficient use of water in schools.\u201d It was the first experience with such a meaningful project. We have done a great job with my team preparing presentations as well as giving other administrative support to the project events. During the implementation of this project we met with such international organizations as OSCE and the Japanese Embassy. We had lots of discussions regarding that project and English proficiency helped us as much as practicing it. Likewise, I am one of the members of our school Parliament, where we organize different social events, such as competitions, concerts, etc.\n\nAll the above-mentioned experience makes me more confident to take an active part in extracurricular activities of AUCA in the future and do all my best to make a good contribution to the social life of AUCA. Moreover, my educational background will help me to learn new things easily.\n\nBut to pursue my degree at AUCA I need financial support from Kiva because I live in a family of seven, my parents and four siblings, where my father is the only breadwinner. He helps my grandfather in agriculture, which means that this is a seasonal work, so my father can\u2019t afford covering the tuition fees fully. \n\nThe reason I am applying for financial support is that I am the eldest child in the family. My two other siblings also study: my sister is becoming a student this year, and my brother is in eighth grade in high school. So financial aid would greatly help me to be more concentrated on the studies rather on how to earn money and cover my tuition

is a student at AUCA. This is her story.\n\nMy name is Diana. This year I have graduated from my high school \u2013 Aychurok Kyrgyz-Turkish girls\u2019 school. For most of the students the last year of school is the most crucial, as they have to decide what they are going to do in their life and choose the place to study that fits them the best. However, for me it wasn\u2019t a difficult task since I had already decided that AUCA is the best place for my higher education. It is obvious that this university is one of the most prestigious, not only in our country, but also in the whole Central Asia.\n\nI learned about AUCA when I was only in seventh grade. I decided to enroll at AUCA after high school. Since then I improved the level of my English language proficiency, because this is one of requirements of AUCA. \n\nI think I fully meet AUCA requirements and really hope to get financial aid from Kiva, because it is unaffordable for my family to cover it fully.\n\nAs far as I know, the student life of AUCA is very vivacious and interesting. I am the one who always takes part in social life. I think I will be able to contribute to the social life of AUCA, making it more colorful and enjoyable, which will be a very good experience for me too. Moreover, I am a very diligent and determined student, and I am sure that I will be able to learn new subjects without any difficulties.\n\nNow I am on the final step to reach my goal. I would really admire your understanding my situation and providing financial aid.

The gathered harvest is sold in the city market. Hamlet is supporting his family's living by the income from agriculture, so the farming business is very important to him. Years ago, he enlarged the arable land he owned and now he is able to cultivate more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the community where Hamlet lives, there is not much agricultural equipment that will help farmers with cultivation. So, this enthusiastic farmer, with good credit history behind him, has applied to SEF International for a loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan's help, Hamlet plans to purchase a plow to support the cultivation process.

She started ten years ago with the purchase of animals for 15,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has one dairy cow, 38 sheep and one stallion.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Venera turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to fatten and resell.

Thanks to her hard work, Tursunay now has two dairy cows and 15 sheep on her farm.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Tursunay turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to fatten and resell.

Most of the women in this group, from the very small town of San Gabriel, Suchitepequez, have tortilla making businesses and one woman sells other food items. Only one woman in the group can read and write.  The women have made good progress with their businesses as Namaste is the first organization to give them the opportunity to learn how to manage their business and their money, in addition to offering microcredit.\n\nMar\u00eda Cristina, second from the left in the photo, is a 37 year old mother of two children, one in school and one still too young for school.  With her business, making and selling tortillas, she is able to send her children to school.  She has had this business for seven years. During her first nine months with Namaste she moved her business from a stall in the central market in the nearby city of Mazatenango to a stall she rents in the bus terminal in her small town of San Gabriel.

United New-Monika Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms.Monika is 44 years old, married and has five children with one dependent. She is a member of Kasenyi United group and has been a member of the group for the last five years. She is in the fishing business which she started doing in the year 1994 and she was very optimistic that the business would grow and fetch enough money as profits. \n\nMonika picked interest in the business because it was the most rewarding business in the area since they are near a lake. The business is located in Kasenyi, near the landing site in Kasese District. She gives this business enough time and on average, she gives it eight hours in a day and while off the fishing business, she attends to a bar which is her other source of income. She plans to use the loan money (5,000,000 uganda shillings) for buying fish nets and boats so that she is able to catch more fish and have increased sales and hence high profits. \n\nHer clients are people from Kasese and those in far off areas since she takes the fish to other places for sale. For the time she has been in the fishing Industry, Monika says her main challenge has been transport which is really poor since the roads are bad and this increases the transport fares and in the long run cuts her profits. Her other challenge, is the influence from the government since it some times bars them (fishermen) from fishing in that lake. \n\nHowever despite the challenges, Monika says she will keep being the hard-working person she has always been so that she one day owns a plot of land. She thanks Ugafode and Kiva lenders for the support they have been giving to the group."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4033.33,"image":{"id":1411697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fishing nets and boats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-30T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-29T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":6050,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elnest","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Idi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Latif","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djibriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":15500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":6050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1008.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1008.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583333,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880164,"comment":null},{"amount":1008.34,"local_amount":2583334,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2588552.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983825,"comment":null},{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583332.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635917,"comment":null},{"amount":1008.33,"local_amount":2583333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2588551.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863355,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T11:15:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597826,"name":"Desire","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Desire is 36 years a resident of Katende Maya LC1 zone. \n\nDesire has a mini super market dealing in daily use household items, food stuffs and beverages in a slightly busy market in the outskirts of the city.She started this business three years ago as source of income after she had failed to find a job.
