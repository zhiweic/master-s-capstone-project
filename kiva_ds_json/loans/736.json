In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

She is a mother of three children. They are 18 years old, 15 years old and 13 years old. She has been selling vegetable soup since 2009 from her house. She also sells fried snacks. The business is running smoothly and she can generate income to help her husband sustain the family. Her husband is a part-time laborer and only works if there is an order.

Regina is 20 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past four years, Regina has been working hard to manage her small business which makes and sells cassava flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Regina has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more cassava and will help Regina to generate greater profits and improve her family's welfare. Regina hopes that in the future she will be able to start a big retail shop. \r\n\r\nRegina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has improved Regina's future prospects by helping her to learn more about herself and how to improve her relationship with her husband.

For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her small shop, which sells second-hand clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Moreen has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more bundles of clothing for resale, and will help Moreen to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Moreen hopes that in the future she will be able to buy land to build a house on. <p>\r\n\r\nMoreen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Moreen's future prospects by helping her to develop life goals.

He lives with his wife and children in a big traditional family with his parents and his brothers in Lafiabougou, a suburb of Sikasso. Mr. Siaka did not have the chance to finish school, so he quickly began buying and selling hardware. He has a hardware store at a large market in Sikasso. He is well sought-out by his clients because of the quality of his products. To satisfy his growing clientele, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso more than a year ago.  He has received two loans which were both properly repaid. This is his third loan which will allow him to increase his business. With the third loan, he plans to buy 22 cardboard tubs, 15 boxes of glue, 18 cans of paint, 80 meters of wire, 10 shovels, and 10 spades. He buys from wholesale traders in Bamako before reselling to his clients - generally composed of home builders (architects, contractors, masons, etc.). With this loan, he plans to make a monthly profit of 275,000 FCFA which will be used for family expenses, paying interest on his loan, and investing in the rest of his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":941219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy hardware.

Florence is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Florence has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells food and home supplies to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food items for resale, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and cover her family's medical expenses. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to purchase land and build a house. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

She lives with her husband and their children in Wayerma I, one of the neighborhoods at the outskirts of the city of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nOver seven years ago, after running several businesses unsuccessfully, Fatoumata Modibo started this business buying and selling clothes, beauty products and other various items.  She runs her business out of the large market in Sikasso.  Now, she wants to take advantage of this loan from Soro Yiriwaso to become a large-scale saleswoman in the market she works in, in order, ultimately, to better satisfy her customers, most of whom are women.\r\nShe is on her fifth individual loan cycle.

She lives in the town of Malambo with her husband and 9 year old son. She has a variety store in her house, where she sells women's accessories, paper products, beauty items and other merchandise, according to the season. Her enterprising experience began 15 years ago, when, using her creativity, she started her business. She made artisanal crafts with her own hands, taking advantage of the fact that her spouse worked in a store. He made commercial contacts in the small communities nearby and built their own clientele. Finally, less than 2 years ago, when her husband stopped working in the store, they invested his severance package in a variety store. They mixed their own products and various merchandise. They started selling via orders and later sold according to each season. \r\n\r\nDilsa's creativity knows no limits, nor does her desire to learn. Besides making products out of materials such as leather, she also learned to make sandals, which she displays in her store with much pride. Her business is growing gradually, because her clientele has expanded.

","en":"Maribel, age 42, lives in a neighborhood located in the south of the city with her husband and 4 children, ages 5 to 23.  There, she is engaged in the sale of varied merchandise, especially perfumes and clothing in all styles.  In order to fill her orders in the competitive market in which she participates, Maribel is applying for a Kiva loan.  This is the first financing she has sought from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domino.  With it she will buy clothing in which her customers will be very elegant at the year-end parties.\r\n<p>\r\nMaribel began her business more than 11 years ago.  Initially she sold few items, but gradually she added new products.  In addition, she was able to get new suppliers who, thanks to her sister\u2019s representative account number, provided her with guides or catalogues which she could use to promote sales to customers.  Her customers are primarily workers in businesses and neighbors in the area where she lives with her family.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, it is very close to the season of great commercial activity during which sales increase and require a lot of inventory to respond to orders from her customers, which are at a greater volume than usual.  This is the reason why her plans for investment of the loan would be successfully for she would earn a little more from the rapid turnover of inventory and would respond to the expectations of increasing business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":939915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a greater quantity of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":87807},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89856},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91952},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94098},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96294},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98540},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100840},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103193},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105601},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108065},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":110586},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":113168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":87807,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88127.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188778,"comment":null},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":89856,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90183.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324983,"comment":null},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":91952,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":92287.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039044,"comment":null},{"amount":49.01,"local_amount":94098,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94441.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651189,"comment":null},{"amount":50.16,"local_amount":96294,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96645.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140795,"comment":null},{"amount":103.84,"local_amount":199380,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":200106.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100698,"comment":null},{"amount":53.75,"local_amount":103193,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103569.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394900,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":105601,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":105986,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774736,"comment":null},{"amount":56.28,"local_amount":108065,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108458.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386726,"comment":null},{"amount":116.54,"local_amount":223754,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":224569.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993622,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T23:50:02Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369007,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is 37 years old and is married.

For the past two years, She has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells food and home supplies to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Gorret has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food items to sell in her shop, and will help Gorret generate greater profits and pay her sister's school fees. Gorret hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nGorret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Gorret's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

They are on average 31 years old and have on average three children. They live in the Darsalam area of Segou (fourth administrative region of Mali)\r\n\r\nThey met each other through neighborhood ties, kinship, and through their income generating activities at the Medine Segou Market. The group members sell women\u2019s clothing, used clothing (yougou yougou), cosmetic products (incense) and children clothing.\r\n\r\nThe group members joined Soro Yiriwaso in order to increase their working capital to be able to make their purchases in cash. This is their fourth group loan.\r\n \r\nMrs. Korotimi (the woman in the middle of the photo) is known in Darsalam for the sale of her quality incense especially during wedding seasons. She is planning on using her loan to buy 1 kg of magnonkiss\u00e8ni, six tubes of quality perfume and a box of eau de Cologne. To make incense the magnonkiss\u00e8ni is soaked in \u201ceau de Cologne\u201d for at least a week then it is scented with perfume.  Thesales are made in cash or on credit from home or at the Medine market or as an itinerant saleswoman in the town of Segou. She sells to customers who are generally women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mrs. Korotomi hopes to make a monthly average profit of 25, 000 Francs CFA. She will use it to meet the needs of the family and provide for the children\u2019s health expenses. Like all the other members of the group, her goal is to reinvest her savings in her small business in order to perpetuate it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":941437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase basic products to make incense.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotimi                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874439,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283271,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424782,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140047,"comment":null},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-29T08:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757021,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-27T08:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84148.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251779,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T17:19:25Z","paid_date":"2012-06-27T08:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369097,"name":"Gloria Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria trabaja en un colegio del pa\u00eds, tiene planes de ir cambiando la infraestructura de su vivienda.

The members of the group buy and sell used clothing, children's clothing, cosmetic products (incense), handbags and jewelry (necklaces). With the goal of building up their sales stock, the members of the group decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their 5th solidarity loan. Madame Mariam (1st woman on the left of the photo) has a great reputation for selling used clothing in the Darsalam S\u00e9gou neighborhood. She plans to use her loan to buy two bales of used clothing at Segou\u2019s Grand Market.  She sells them for cash or credit at the M\u00e9dine market and by walking from place to place in S\u00e9gou to a clientele consisting mainly of women. With this loan, Madame Mariam hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 26,000 CFA that will be used to provide for the basic needs of the family \u2014 food and school expenses.

menor, de 14 a\u00f1os, debido a que sus otros hijos ya son mayores de edad y tiene entre 28 y 35 a\u00f1os. Juana vive y trabaja en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1, ubicada en el sur del Per\u00fa, un oasis extenso y seco ubicado en el desierto de Sechura que domina la costa en la parte sudoeste del pa\u00eds. Caman\u00e1 ha sido hist\u00f3ricamente un importante destino tur\u00edstico en el Per\u00fa, sin embargo, los frecuentes y fuertes terremotos y tsunamis en la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada (un 8,4 en 2001 y 8,0 en 2007) diezm\u00f3 la ciudad, destruido la industria del turismo en Caman\u00e1, y costando muchos de sus puestos de trabajo, los medios de subsistencia, y los hogares. Pero el resultado de un desempleo es que crea un ambiente preparado para las microfinanzas. El microfinanciamiento permite a las personas que no tienen muchos recursos y cuentan con un peque\u00f1o negocio tener una oportunidad como negociante en el mercado laboral.\t\n\nJuana empez\u00f3 su negocio en el a\u00f1o  en el \u00e1rea de venta de abarrotes (Arroz, Az\u00facar, Leche, etc.).  Con el pr\u00e9stamo de S\/.2,000 que recibir\u00e1 gracias a KIVA, Juana podr\u00e1 tener el dinero suficiente para poder comprar cajas de \u201cPANETONES\u201d, (En Per\u00fa Tradicionalmente se come este producto en la cena de navidad, como complemento, est\u00e1 hecho de una especie similar a los bizcochos con algunas frutas confitadas), y as\u00ed poder venderlos y mejorar sus ventas en su tienda por temporada navide\u00f1a. Este cr\u00e9dito ayuda a Juana a seguir entusiasmada, y continuar pensando en un futuro donde contin\u00fae con su negocio y este la ayude a poder construir el techo de su cocina.\t\n","en":"Juana is a dedicated and hardworking woman who is always seeking progress. She has 3 children and at this time is only taking care of the youngest, who is 14. Her other children are grown and aged 28 and 35. Juana lives and works in the city of Caman\u00e1, located in southern Peru, an extensive dry oasis in the Sechura desert of Peru, which dominates the coast in the Southwestern part of the country. Caman\u00e1 has been an important tourist destination historically. Nonetheless, the frequent strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the last decade  (an 8.4 in 2001 and 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroying the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1, costing a lot of jobs, ways of making a living and homes.  But a result of the unemployment is that it creates an environment ready for micro-finance. Micro-finance allows people who don't have a lot of resources and who have a small business to have an opportunity as a businessperson in the labor market. \r\n\r\nJuana started her business in the area of selling groceries (rice, sugar, milk, etc.). With the loan of S\/.2,000 that she will receive thanks to KIVA, Juana will be able to have enough money to be able to buy boxes of panetones. In Peru,  this product is traditionally eaten at Christmas dinner as a dessert. It is similar to fruitcake. She can sell them and improve her sales for the Christmas season. This loan helps Juana stay enthusiastic and keep thinking in the future, where she will continue with her business and build a roof over her kitchen.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":941532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy panetones (Christmas bread) and sell it for the Christmas season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T12:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":139.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":149.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":173.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":193.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":201.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":135.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":136.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142502,"comment":null},{"amount":699.37,"local_amount":1864.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1884.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-08T16:59:17Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369163,"name":"Jose Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, necesitan mejorar su vivienda, por eso solicita pr\u00e9stamo e invertirlo en ladrillo, cemento, arena, hierro, pago de mano de obra, con lo cual espera que hacer una reparaciones y construir un nuevo cuarto.

On her own, she began planting a variety of tubers like potatoes, olluco, mashua [tuberous nasturium] and oca [New Zealand yam]. Thankfully, her husband helps her with her work. Over time they have achieved many things, like buying their own farmland. But this is not the couple's only economic activity - they also knit traditional wool blankets, which earns them extra money. Juana also raises animals including sheep, pigs and pack mules. She takes good care of them because the sale of one animal can cover some of their household expenses.

is Ellen.  She is 51 years old, married, and has three children aged 29, 22 and 15 years. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her because she was adopted. \n\nIn 1996, Ellen established her pub business. She began her business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough to support their family, so she had to sell drinks to get extra income to help her husband provide a livelihood for their children.
