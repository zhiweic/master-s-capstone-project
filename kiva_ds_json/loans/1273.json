She is currently the representative of the Los Artesanos de los Encuentros group.  She can be seen in the center of the photo.\r\n\r\nShe works creating bracelets, belts, and wallets made with tiny beads.  She works from her home.  She chose this type of work because she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to study, due to a lack of economic resources.  It is because of this that she can\u2019t choose a conventional job. But she says that she is happy doing this work, because she has done it for four years, she earns a good income, and the earnings have helped her to contribute to the finances of her family.\r\n\r\nNow she has decided to create a group to make more artisan crafts, with the goal of contributing to their families in terms of finances.  Because of this, they are asking for a loan for the purchase of products such as tiny beads and other items that are needed to make the crafts.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to increase her earnings through her business and thus to have a stand in the local market so that people get to know her work, and in this way to improve the finances of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":40.87,"image":{"id":1474496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy bead products for the production of artisan crafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T14:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T14:30:06Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u00e9ctor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":354.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":368.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":377.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":412.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":426.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":447}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":319.86,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":322.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429993983,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T03:30:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636054,"name":"Burulkan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d 33 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 2 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 3 \u0434\u043e\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430. \u0423 \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d -

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Mareta, and she hopes for lenders' support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":42.07,"image":{"id":1476822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for a printer, scanner and training in an accounting program.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T16:30:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mareta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":16572.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21263.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":21311.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":22714.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22517.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22850.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22955.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":23528.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":23245.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":24419.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":24581.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":24596.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25471.6},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25536.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25926.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":26696.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":26731},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27041.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27722.7},{"due_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28048},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":28348.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28882.4},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29309.7},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29728.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.45},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.74},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":16829.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17037.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439846109,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T02:25:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636875,"name":"Sophal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophal is 56 years old and married.

She began working in this business three years ago. Before that, she was employed at a supermarket and worked Monday through Sunday, which was very distressing because she could not share time with her family.

One of her biggest goals is to bring loom classes to all of Chile. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she requests will help her to buy a more modern loom than the one she has, and also to buy more wool since she has many orders for wool garments. She is very happy and excited because she knows that she will do very well. \r\n\r\nShe enjoys working together with Fondo Esperanza [Hope Fund], because it gives the opportunity to receive money and to be able to share with different people. One of the things that she likes the most is that they always make time to share with the other partners of the bank.\r\n       \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3310.11,"image":{"id":1475204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy wool and a loom.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Castro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T18:50:06Z","loan_amount":8000,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Elisabeth De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carlos Rene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Orfelina Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Betty Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marlene Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maryorie Nazaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ekaterina Anais","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Angelica Audolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Liliana Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eudalia Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lidia Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Saira Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Doris Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eralia Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carla Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Margarita Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yudyt Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gladys Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosanna Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mirella De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":4169588,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":8000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":270885},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":286482},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":288670},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":290854},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":293055},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":295276},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":297512},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":299777},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":302051},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":304338},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":306639},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":308971},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":311305},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":313773}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":519.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":549.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":553.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":558.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":566.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":570.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":579.53},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":588.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":597.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":602.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":519.73,"local_amount":270885,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":271041.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503280,"comment":null},{"amount":2790.38,"local_amount":1454337,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1455174.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T01:44:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636923,"name":"Im's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Im is 31 years old, married, and has three children.

Thus, she would like to provide schooling to her grandchildren, expand her business plans, and build a nice house for her retirement. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, she thanks Hekima very much for promoting autonomy among unbanked women entrepreneurs, especially during this critical time of war in the country's east.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2349,"image":{"id":1478407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase 'pagne' cloth to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo","town":"Goma, North Kivu province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"0 25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":160,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":10000,"lender_count":278,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Claire","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ajabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wamunzila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":10000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2349,"local_amount":2349,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2349,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440003675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T19:53:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":635193,"name":"Mauricio Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mauricio de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, solo estudio hasta el nivel intermedio de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, se acompa\u00f1o muy joven, su pareja  trabaja vendiendo tortillas que elabora con sus hijas mayores todos los d\u00edas.

He entered into a relationship when he was very young.  His life partner works selling tortillas that she makes with their older daughters every day.  His daughters no longer go to school.  Only the 12 year old goes to the seventh grade at the community school, which is two kilometers from their house.\r\n\r\nMaricio does agricultural work for himself and as a salaried worker.  At times he also works as an assistant bricklayer.  He generally works almost every day.  He has been working this way ever since he was young.  He used to work with his father.\r\n\r\nBefore, Maricio was the only one that worked.  However, at times it was difficult to cover his household\u2019s living expenses.  When the family grew, there were more expenses.  His life partner started to work in order to help her husband with the household expenses.  Now, his older daughters are involved after having finished the ninth grade in school.  The area where he works is in his own community, and he just uses a bicycle to get there.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to buy raw material for his wife\u2019s business of selling tortillas.  He will buy corn and firewood.  He will also harvest 7,000 square meters of corn that he has grown one kilometer from his house.  This way, his wife will have inventory in order to work with their daughters.  Meanwhile, Mauricio works as a day worker.  They assure themselves of having financial stability and of keeping the customers to whom they provide tortillas every day.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to expand his house by building a new room.  This is because his daughters are older, and the family has grown.  He wants to see if it is possible for his daughters to continue their high school education.  Even though it is in the future, he would like them to be able to be successful professionally.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29.18,"image":{"id":1474353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw material for his wife\u2019s business of selling tortillas.

Her spouse is working in Russia. Zarima works as a teacher at a local school and her salary is not enough to provide for the whole family.  Thus, Zarima has decided to raise livestock and farm in order to provide additional income for her family.  She started nine years ago with a purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Zarima's household now has 6 dairy cows, 10 sheep, 10 goats, as well as a plot of land measuring 1.47 hectares, on which she grows peppers, cabbage and cotton. Her monthly income is 8,000 KGS. Zarima is part of the group \"Zhashtyk\", which includes 2 more people, 3 in total. Zarima is the group leader. In order to further develop her business, Zarima has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 90,000 som KGS to purchase cows for cattle breeding. Zarima plans to invest the income from the loan Zarima into further increasing the amount of domestic animals, and plans to accumulate funds for the construction of an outhouse with a summer kitchen."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.61,"image":{"id":1475795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Burgondu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3873},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3986},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4102},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4222},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4345},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4472},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4602},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4736},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4875},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5017},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5163},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5314},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5469},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5628},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5792},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5961},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6135},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6308}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.61},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.53},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.61,"local_amount":3873,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3893.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942724,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T01:56:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636931,"name":"Veasna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veasna is in early 20s and resides in Moung Russey district of Battambang province.

Her husband and younger son are working in Russia as builders, and send money back home to  Kyrgyzstan every month.  However, the money is not enough for a family and Bumairam has decided not to sit idly by, and to develop a livestock business. Thankfully, this worked out okay. She started her business 15 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 2,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Bumairam's household has 6 dairy cows, 10 sheep and 5 horses, as well as a plot of land measuring 0.72 hectares, which she uses to grow corn. Her monthly income is 8,000 KGS. Bumairam is a member of the group \"Zhashtyk\", which includes 2 other people. Bumairam is the second member. In order to further grow her business, Bumairam has appealed to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai - Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 20,000 KGS for the purchase of sheep for breeding. Bumairam plans to invest the income from the loan into further increasing the amount of livestock, and plans to save enough money to purchase sheepyards to further expand her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":18.3,"image":{"id":1475828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Burgondu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bumairam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":861},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":886},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":912},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":938},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":994},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1023},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1053},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1083},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1115},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1147},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1181},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1215},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1251},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1287},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1325},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1363},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.58},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.3,"local_amount":861,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":894.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-15T08:31:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636936,"name":"Kin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kin is 45 years old and married with five dependent children.

","en":"Fariza is a young and ambitious girl. She is 19 years old. She is not married and lives with her parents and sisters. Fariza was born and raised in a poor family. Her father is a migrant worker in Russia. After high school, she could not attend university, as her parents did not have enough money to pay for her tuition.

In 1996, John started Sustainable Community Development Services (SCODE), a national NGO that started as a community-based organization with an aim to enable the poor in Kenya to improve their lives by adopting environmentally friendly technologies. SCODE exists to facilitate adoption of clean energy technologies and sustainable land use approaches through capacity building, awareness campaigns, and last-mile product distribution. The organization has an office and community-training center in Kenya. Over the last 17 years, SCODE has established a track record of promoting solar energy, improving management of natural resources, and allowing low-income families to improve both their quality of life and carbon footprint. In 2006, SCODE won the prestigious Energy Globe Award for Sustainable Energy in recognition of its work with small-scale farmers across Western Kenya.\n\nOne Degree Solar started working with John in 2011 when introducing its first solar lighting product, during which time One Degree sent a summer intern to work with SCODE and begin developing an SMS tool to help monitor impact. SCODE was a natural partner with years of experience selling solar systems, clean cook stoves, and other life-improving products. SCODE now sells the One Degree BrightBox system, which powers up to four light bulbs, as well as mobile phones and radios. Currently, families spend significant portions of their incomes on kerosene, candles, phone charging services, and toxic dry cell batteries for radios.\n\nSCODE has also developed an innovative Solar Energy Demonstration Project, which is intended to reassure consumers of the reliability of solar technology and to build local capacity for after-sales service. This targeted program helps to demystify the technology, localize it, and encourage more entrepreneurs and families to invest in it. The project trains local electricians on solar PV installation and maintenance, while ensuring end-users have knowledge of proper use and preventative maintenance.\n\nJohn and his small team have sold over 200 BrightBox systems in the last few months, and they have several potential customers asking for systems without means of affording them. With your help, SCODE will be able to offer BrightBox with extended financing to low-income end-users who want to break the cycle of constantly buying polluting, unhealthy, and unsafe energy.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":13925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1475255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-11-25T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-24T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":13925,"lender_count":393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":13920,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":13925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":13920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T06:31:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":635824,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce has continued to sell BrightBox to low-income farmers across Western Kenya.

These same farmers are often stuck spending $10-$15 per month - a considerable portion of their income - on lighting and phone charging.\n\nTo break this cycle and make renewable energy accessible to these customers, Laban would like to start offering flexible payment terms to those who need it most, while also increasing his inventory on hand to serve more customers.  He seeks support from Kiva lenders to make this happen.\n\nLaban will use funds for 50 BrightBoxes, which will be used to energize and empower households across his region. Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4-5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. With your help, Laban will help families eliminate energy expenses, improve safety, and allow their children to read into the night.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1474612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for solar energy systems and offer financing plans to lower-income farmers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":276,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3870,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T18:07:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637086,"name":"Zainab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainab is in her late twenties and married with three children.

Mar\u00eda says that for cultural reasons she was not able to pursue studies, and that this has presented her with some great difficulties in life. However, she says that she has never wasted time and has always had the strength to get ahead. She is married and has five children, three of whom are still under her responsibility. Two of her children are already married and have their own children, but still live with Mar\u00eda and her husband.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started her tamale business ten years ago, selling corn tamales when corn was in season. Upon seeing the number of customers she was attracting, she worked hard to diversify the kinds of tamales she was selling, making tamales with chicken, with black beans and with duck. Mar\u00eda sells her tamales every day of the week. She leaves home every day at 4 p.m. with her youngest son, who helps her carry the tamales. They walk through all of the local communities, returning home at 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting this loan to buy ingredients such as corn and vegetables, and to buy a large container for transporting tamales. She hopes with these she will be able to increase her production.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Mar\u00eda hopes to increase her production and to have her own space in the center of the city from which to sell her tamales, instead of selling them from place to place. She says that with the passing years, she is more tired, and that she would prefer to sell her tamales from a fixed location."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1475471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients such as corn and vegetables, and to buy a large container for transporting tamales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":22.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":27.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.21},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716521,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T15:54:38Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637133,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Nancy.

dreams of becoming a chef. To achieve her goal, Marizabel has enrolled in the Instituto Helen. She plans to graduate but without a loan from Vittana, she thinks that she may need to take time off to work and save until she can return to school. With the loan, Marizabel plans to spend the money towards purchasing her textbooks. As an added expense, textbooks are often not bought to save money. With them, Marizabel hopes to be able to better understand her subjects. Marizabel currently works 25 hours a week but making time to work and go to school has been one of her biggest challenges. At her job, Marizabel earns $4 a day but with a degree in culinary arts, she expects to earn $15 a day.

The parents are proud of their children, as they grew up to be good people. The residents of the village where Abdanbek and his family live speak very warmly about them. He is a very responsible person, a good husband and a loving father. Abdanbek has a high school education and is currently on a pension, but despite that continues to work shifts as a guard. \r\n\r\nTo earn extra income for his family, Abdanbek works in animal husbandry, a business he began 30 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 1,000 KGS. Thanks to his hard work, his holding now contains one milk cow and 10 sheep as well as a small plot from which he receives a rich annual harvest of produce including strawberries, raspberries and various types of apple. Not everyone can raise such fruits and berries - they need special care. Abdanbek takes care of these berries and fruits with great attention and love, and therefore his harvest is always excellent. He also has 1.08 hectares of agricultural land on which he grows beans and potatoes.\r\n\r\nAbdanbek's children and wife actively help him on the land. The family is happy and hardworking. Their monthly income is 15,000 KGS. Abdanbek is the second member of three in the group Zeta-2. With the goal of further developing his business, Abdanbek has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 25,000 KGS to purchase sheep to increase his head count. He plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of his herd, and to save up for his youngest son's wedding.

EL Sauce is known for being a dairy-producing zone.  The members of this communal bank are known for being hard-working and responsible with great desires to better their situations.  They are currently working hard to offer their young children a better future through education, which they, unfortunately, weren't able to have due to a lack of financial resources. \r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the bank is Jaqueline, and her business is selling handicrafts as a street vendor.  She sells clay decorations, clay cottages, kitchen sets, money boxes, clay jars, hanging decorations and bells.  She works about ten hours a day selling her products.  Her objective with the loan is to invest in working capital- buying and selling handicrafts- so that in the near future she can earn a better income.  The communal bank \"Manos Unidas\" is grateful for the help the Kiva lenders are offering to low-income people in poor countries, like Nicaragua, so they can earn a dignified living.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":85.84,"image":{"id":1475481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to invest in working capital and to stock up her handicraft business by purchasing vases, clay cottages, kitchen sets, pots, money boxes, clay jars, hanging decorations and bells.
