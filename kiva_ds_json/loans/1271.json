lives in Vanadzor town with his mother, wife and two daughters. \r\n\r\nOver 10 years, Artur has worked as a taxi driver using his own car.  He mainly drives to Yerevan-Vanadzor and Vanadzor-Georgia and he has a lot of customers. They prefer to travel such far distances in his taxi since he drives attentively and very carefully.\r\n\r\nFor tackling financial hardships, Artur also has a small furniture-production business in his garage, but because of the many difficulties he faces with the furniture-making business, the main profitable activity is taxi driving. \r\n\r\nCurrently, his car needs to be renovated so he isn't able to drive the taxi. Realizing the importance of the income from taxi driving business, Artur has applied for this loan.

She has been in teaching for many years, but found that the income from teaching was not enough to sustain herself and her family. The reason she went into agriculture was to get additional income.\r\n\r\nHer challenge has been a lack of capital to buy farm inputs to increase her output and earn more income.

He is single, and he studied until high school. Only his parents live with him.\r\n\r\nSantiago makes a living through planting vegetables (corn, huisquil, green beans). He has around 6 years of experience in this activity, from which he obtains his income to come out ahead. He learned this activity because some institutions began community projects with the goal of making more profitable crops. He has always grown corn and beans. The plot that he works is in the same site as his home, but he works for another man and that is 1 km from his house. To travel there, he goes by foot.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to purchase 2 quintals (about 100 lbs.) of fertilizer and green bean seeds. He will also pay for labor to clear the land, as well as insecticides for pest control and to make his crops more profitable. He will purchase all of the supplies at once, which will be more economical.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to prepare another part of the land and to make it capable of establishing an irrigation system so that in the dry season he is able to plant vegetables and become a potential producer more so than he has been until now. This will help to alleviate the shortage of economic resources. From the profits obtained he will project himself, as he will invest in the successive new cycle of cultivation. In that way, this will be a good investment so that at the end he is able to do what he has proposed, and  improve his income and help his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25.23,"image":{"id":1473412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase 2 quintals (about 100 lbs.) of fertilizer and green bean seeds, as well as to pay the labor for clearing the land and insecticides to control pests.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":24.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":35.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.22},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.23,"local_amount":25.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:31Z","rounded_local_amount":25.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716501,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-25T22:24:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634512,"name":"Marta Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta, vive junto a su t\u00eda, su cu\u00f1ada u sus abuelos, es una mujer que ha prendido a manejar su sala de bella sola y por iniciativa propia es una actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, lo atiende todos los d\u00edas y sin un horario especific\u00f3. \nSolicita capital para comprar tintes, u\u00f1as, esmaltes, labiales, sombras, etc., con lo que espera que el inventario del negocio este muy bien surtido para atender a sus clientes, mejorar sus ganancias, cancelar las cuotas y ganar m\u00e1s clientes.\nSue\u00f1a con tener los recursos econ\u00f3micos para estudiar una carrera universitaria que le de mejores oportunidades de superaci\u00f3n personal.\n","en":"Marta lives together with her aunt, her sister-in-law and her grandparents.

The family has therefore decided to benefit as much as possible from available natural resources. He has already invested in solar panels to provide electricity to his home and is now purchasing a 40-cubic-meter Sistema Biobolsa biodigester to turn the abundant animal waste on his farm into multiple resources. He will use the digester to transform cow manure into renewable biogas and biofertilizer.

Felipe also enjoys the privileges being a member of the Cooperative. \r\n\r\nNow, he is applying a loan of 14,900 PHP [Philippines peso] to restock more inventory for his buying and selling business. Expanding his inventories will increase his income, and from it, he wishes to have a stable income for his family. And someday, he hopes to buy a four-wheel vehicle to transport goods in other towns. All he wants for his family is to have a happy and comfortable life.\r\n\r\nFelipe deeply wishes to maintain as a member in good standing with Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative.

She is this way in order to give her family better living conditions, that is to say, food, clothing, housing, and good health.  She went to school until the fifth grade.  She is married, and her husband works as a bricklayer.  Her three children live in the house with them, and they go to school.\r\n\r\nThree days a week she makes bread to sell.  Besides that, she gets remittances that a cousin sends her.  She has been a baker for four years.  She says that she learned to make bread because her mother did.  When she was younger and did not have anything else to do, she helped her mother.  After she got used to it, she decided to do it by herself.  She went out to sell it because it did not get all sold out at home.  For the moment, this is her only business.  Before she was a baker, she solely devoted herself to the household chores.  Her husband helps her buy the raw material so that she is able to make the bread.  Her work schedule varies.  Sometimes she makes the bread in the morning and goes to sell it in the afternoon.  Other times she makes it in the afternoons and goes out to sell it in the mornings.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to build a retaining wall in back of her house.  She wants to do this because during the raining season the dirt breaks loose and that makes it difficult for the water to drain.  In order to do this she will buy ten bags of cement, two \u2018quintales' [a quintal is 100 pounds] of iron, and a truckload of sand.  Purchasing all the materials she needs for the construction will help so that the wall will not be damaged by the dirt that gets broken up.\r\n\r\nShe intends to improve her business.

In 2008, after analyzing various options for investing some savings she had, she decided that selling merchandise was her best option. She took advantage of the opportunity that arose when her husband was transferred to the city, because there she could buy the merchandise at a lower cost and send it to her hometown, where her mother offers it to neighbors and friends. Additionally, she offers it at the military base where she lives, since her husband is a soldier. In this way, she has generated sufficient resources to contribute to her household economy, and she has been able to provide education to her children. \r\n\r\nShe is motivated to request this loan because she aims to invest in buying merchandise on a wholesale basis (jeans, blouses, accessories and t-shirts, among other items). Thus she will have a greater variety of stock to offer her customers, so that she can satisfy their diverse tastes and needs, especially during the end-of-year season, a time in which her sales increase. This will improve the level of income she receives for her work. Luz dreams of strengthening her business to serve new customers and to offer merchandise from recognized brands, which she has not been able to include in her portfolio since they are expensive. Now, however, with the help of the loan, she will have the possibility of doing this. Her motivation is to continue ensuring her children's well-being and to have the opportunity to improve the quality of life for all of her family.

The main reason I enrolled in the International and Business Law department is that I want to be a winner. Doing my job good so nobody could hurt my clients is my aim. \r\n\r\nI believe that the process of protecting the rights of clients does not end by the result of the court. I hope that my consulting as a lawyer will not allow my clients let somebody impinge on their indisputable rights for freedom, opinion, and the freedom of speech. For achieving my aim I will become a professional, and I truly believe that AUCA has professors that will help me to become the person I want to. \r\n\r\nVictory is a result of a long process with complications and solutions. I will work hard to achieve my goals. See the goal and go get it. It could be seen as idealistic, but it is not. The small win will make me more confident the next time. That will help me when I will get the biggest and important case in my life. I will look behind and see those victories and loses, which I hope will not stop me, and confidence will fill me. \r\n\r\nCertainty is halfway to success for every professional. Being a student of the IBL department is the first step in achieving my aims.

Her family derives its main source of income from agriculture, essentially growing grains and vegetables such as potatoes, onions and carrots. \r\n\r\nHurinisso owns her farming business, and she runs it with her oldest son.  She also makes an additional income from animal husbandry.  However, because the family is large, and their income is small, Hurinisso and her family are poor.

She started in this business 21 years ago, with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulnur's hard labor, her farming business now comprises seven dairy cows, one horse and 35 sheep.

He doesn't have steady work in Tajikistan, which is why he goes to the Russian Federation every year to find work.  It is very difficult for him to be located so far from his parents, wife and three children.  His children are small and his wife has nowhere to work, as she takes care of the children.  Akobir always strives for the betterment of his family.  He returned home not long ago and he wants to make repairs on his house, but he doesn't have the money.  He is asking for a loan to buy building materials like cement, wood, sand, etc. to repair his home.

Gulira has a secondary education. Immediately after graduation, she married Kazybek and from that moment (that is, since 1998) Gulira and her husband's primary source of income has been cattle breeding and agriculture. They started with 1,500 KGS worth of cows. Today Gulira has extensive experience in this work. Through Gulira's hard work, her farm now boasts three dairy cows, forty sheep, and a 0.80 hectare share of land where she grew beans last season. Her monthly income is 6,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Gulira approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy cows in order to generate additional income from milk sales. Gulira plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into further expanding her herds, and plans to save enough money to repair the house where she lives with her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1474779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Buura village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T01:30:08Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T03:09:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636112,"name":"Maysoon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maysoon was born in 1973.

Here is her story.\r\n\u201cThere are lots of different paths in life. Each person chooses his own through which he will go till the end of his life. Certainly, there are such periods when human beings come to the end of the path and make life-changing decisions. By deciding we choose our path and further life. I would like to get good quality knowledge in order to make come true all my subsequent life plans. That is why when choosing the path I already know which one to choose, this turn, part of my life is AUCA. During studying at high school, I have changed three schools due to family reasons. Level of education varied in each one of them. Until fifth grade I studied at \"Bokonbaeva\" school which is located in Osh. The knowledge which I received there was enough for me to pass admission exams to the Kyrgyz-Turkish high school. Three years of my studies at the lyceum clearly demonstrated that I learned twice as much as at the old one. Seeing the difference I clearly understood that my professional goals can be achieved only if I have good quality education. My parents always said and taught that knowledge that I receive is a key to success, and that number of keys will depend on what type of doors for the future I wish to open for myself and maybe even for the country. To study at AUCA was my dream and I am happy to become part of it now. In order to be able to study at AUCA I have to be competitive and need to improve the level of my English. I started going to the English language courses at \"Education for All\" (SOROS). Also, I started taking TOEFL preparation course and studied math on a regular basis with my sister who worked as a teacher at my first school. I think that these efforts did not go in vain, at the end of this school year I will finish my English course in advanced group at \"Education for All\" and have no doubts of receiving a good score on the exams which will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also hope to hold a key to AUCA doors which later will open more doors for other opportunities. Studies at AUCA will definitely give me enough knowledge in order to achieve my goals and bring plans to reality. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to its students one of which is Kiva loan and it gives students a good chance to study here. All the students that need a financial aid are eligible to apply for it and mostly they are awarded a loan. I am also applying for a loan, so that I am able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1475840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

There are lots of advantages why one has chosen to study at this university. The main thing that appeals to me is the study of laws; International business and law to contribute to the development of business and law in Kyrgyzstan in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you study in this field, you can find many different jobs where you can work. During my life, I have always been interested in studying different laws and legislation. I really love watching different court cases on TV. I often defend my friends in different situations and I think I do it very well. Even if I want to create my own business, legal education will help me do so.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have chosen this program because I think that a lawyer is an interesting professional. There are many different legal situations in our lives, and a lawyer can contribute to their solution and help other people.\r\n\r\nAnd the final thing that attracts me is that students and professors have very friendly and close relationships, which makes the studying process itself easier and more pleasant. AUCA gives another unique opportunity to its students, which is loan. The loan is given to all students applying for financial aid, which is given by Kiva.

She is motivated to earn the income to go with the money from her husband's carpentry shop. She is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to invest in cosmetic products and clothing to sell, since she wants to stock her business more for the end of the year. And she plans to use another portion to purchase tools for her husbands workshop. In this way they will earn more income and be able to improve the family's quality of life through better nutrition and education.

This is the first loan that Moses and his group members have applied for from SMT\/Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their respective businesses, make more sales and consequently improve their living conditions. Moses will use his share of the loan (500,000 Sierra Leonean Leones) to buy working tools and radio\/cassette players' spare parts to aid him in his daily professional work.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":71.25,"image":{"id":1475913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy working tools, radio\/cassette players spare parts, to aid him in his daily professional work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2013-11-24T13:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-23T13:30:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Masao ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fatmata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.25,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":309070.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439842667,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T21:35:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":636230,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madina is a first-year student at the American University of Central Asia, in the department of International and Business Law. Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201cStudying at a university is an important period of life for a person. It is a new stage of one's life. It opens new ways to future success for you and teaches you how to survive in this world. Therefore, it's so important to choose the right university. \r\n\r\n\"I chose the American University of Central Asia because I think it's the most high-quality university in the whole of Kyrgyzstan. First, the American studying system is different from the Asian system. I'm sure lessons by foreign professors will help me to broaden my outlook. I will be able to think wider than I do now and I would like to advance my knowledge. \r\n\r\n\"The second reason is the English language. At AUCA, I will have to practise on a daily basis because I will be surrounded by English-speaking people. I will be able to advance to the highest level and then I will be able to travel around the world without any problems with language skills. \r\n\r\n\"Finally, the most important reason is that I will become a high-quality specialist. The American University of Central Asia gives its students high-quality knowledge. Graduates of the AUCA are demanded everywhere in our country as good specialists. Many employers of different companies in Kyrgyzstan value graduates of this university.\r\n\r\n\"Among all the above-mentioned opportunities, AUCA gives Kiva loans to students. I would like to take the opportunity to apply for a loan that could help me to partially cover my tuition fees. It is a great chance for those students whose families are not able to cover their tuition fees fully.\u201d
