Enkhbaatar, 33 years old, lives with his wife and child in Dornod, an eastern province in Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. Since 2002, Enkhbaatar has been providing hairdressing services to local people. His wife offers the same services in another barber shop. Their 2-year-old son goes to pre-school. \r\n\r\n<p>In autumn 2012, the family began building their own house with planks. Due to lack of finances, the interior work is not complete so Enkhbaatar is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 MNT to purchase construction materials such as cement, gypsum, panels, etc. As a result, the family can live in a more comfortable and warm place. Enkhbaatar used his previous loan to open another barber shop and repaid the loan on an established schedule. He is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Stanley replied \"better nutrition and more disposable income.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Stanley owns the following: \"cow, motorcycle\" but does not own \"pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, automobile.\" Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household \"mosquito net, solar power, TV\" but does not have \"electricity, running water, sewing machine, DVD.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used

is 29 years old. He lives in Telavi District with his mother. Suliko requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nSuliko requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nSuliko has already rented a place in the center of the city.

","en":"Jusufjon is a young man, married, with three children. He manufactures modular  bricks and also sells coal. In the wintertime the demand for coal is high, and he earns a good income from his business. Jusufjon is very energetic, and always tries to find work and earn a living. He has many dreams: for example, he would really like for his children to receive a college education. He would like to renovate his house, which has not been renovated for many years, and live in decent conditions. In order to realize these plans, he works a lot.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya which is the training ground for many of Kenya's Olympic runners. She has three children.  Her primary income sources are selling milk and growing crops, and she has been doing this work for 13 years. \r\n\r\nShe stated that what was most enjoyable about farming was 'selling milk to cater for the needs of the family!'  Her biggest challenges are 'the high costs of feeding the animals especially during the dry season.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Lelbonget.'\r\n\r\nJane  will use the loan amount to buy and insure a dairy cow. She was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, 'I was introduced to Juhudi by a friend in the group ...'  Jane was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session and replied, 'how to use credit assets to generate income to repay the credit and to develop oneself.'\r\n\r\nJane's largest monthly expense is farming costs. When she was asked, 'how will this loan benefit your family?' Jane replied, 'more income and nutrients for the family  from the milk produced.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jane owns the following: 'cow and poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower does not have 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and sent the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":455.79,"image":{"id":1283727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married and has five children which are all in school. She sells green bananas and charcoal at the market on a retail basis. She has no additional family members. She has been in this business for the last 10 years. She works seven days a week. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has requested a loan of 300,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more bags of charcoal.

lives in the Nyamira area of Kenya, which is a popular banana growing region. She has 7 children and has been farming for 20 years. Her primary income sources are eggs, tea, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated that the most enjoyable thing about farming is the benefits during harvesting! Her biggest challenge is securing financing. The animals at the farm are named \u201cImburi\". She will use the loan to buy poultry birds.\r\n\r\nZipporah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that they charge reasonable interest rates.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session which she responsed, the loaning process and requirements for the organization.\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

Rebecca lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is single with three children, and one of her children goes to school. She sells charcoal, tomatoes and green bananas at the market on a retail basis. She takes care of three additional family members. She has been in this business for the last 6 years. She works seven days a week. Her major challenges are transportation and seasonality. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 200,000 Uganda shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy bags of charcoal and bunches of green bananas.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a primarily milk producing area. She has 4 children and has been farming for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is keeping dairy animals and having them be a source of income to the family for a long time. Earning from selling milk derives satisfaction. Her biggest challenge is a lack of modern training on how to keep dairy animals and to optimize their production. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Maridadi and Tausi.\r\n\r\nSally was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied that she learned of Juhudi from a friend after a marketing team from Juhudi visited Ndalat.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.  Her answer was: How to work in groups, acquire assets through group lending and repay the loan.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

He is married and has a family.  He has been raising livestock since his childhood and learned this occupation from his parents. He raises goats and sheep at home with his family.  His wife and children help him with this business.\r\n\r\nThe price of livestock is quite low right now, but it will get higher in the spring.  This is why Omid would like to buy a few goats and sheep before the spring.  \r\n\r\nOmid truly enjoys the business he is involved in, and he is trying hard to develop it.  \r\n\r\nAlthough he did not go to school and has no formal education, Omid really wishes he did.  Ever since he was a child, his family always had financial difficulties.  For this reason, he really hopes that his children will study, so that they can get good jobs in the future.\r\n\r\nOmid intends to use his loan to buy goats and sheep, in order to expand his herd.

If she does have regular customers, she has an income of PHP 50,000 a month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy materials and equipment like rakes, shovels, brooms, edgers and other items needed in landscaping. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn hopes that her children will finish their studies and dreams of having more projects and customers. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 45 years old and the mother of one son who attends school.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide a source of income for her family, Kayirkan got involved in animal farming.  She started in this business in 1990 with an initial capital of 1,500 som (KGS).

He lives in the Lanchkhuti District with his wife and 2 children. Avtandil requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a monthly pension from Avtandil\u2019s small income working as a distributor. It is 250 Laris per month. It is hardly enough to supply food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nAvtandil requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is 27 years old. He lives in Baghdati District with wife, mother, brother, sister and an infant daughter. Bejan requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but he had no success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, 2 buffalos and a hectare of agricultural land, where maize is grown. Besides, Bejan owns a vineyard, where 700 wine trees are grown. It is hardly enough to pay for food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBejan requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Bejan will purchase building materials. After purchasing building materials, he plans to build a greenhouse. He will sow cucumbers there and sell them locally at a good price. This will increase the income of the family. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is Nery, a resident of Batasan, Philippines. She is married to Ronald and a mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNery operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php20,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nNery hopes to have a good life and dreams of expanding her business.

They have four children between the ages of 16 and 30.  She started her business when she left Buenaventura, the most important seaport in the Pac\u00edfico Colombiano region.  She arrived in the city to look for better ways of living peacefully and productively for her family.\r\n\r\nMercedes had acquired store experience in her native land.  Once she moved to Barranquilla, she took it up again.  She turned it into her way of generating income.  She was supported by her family, and she was very well-received. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to manage complete sustainability in her business.  To do so, she needs to grow at the same rate as her clientele.  However, she does not have enough inventory to respond to her customers with the merchandise that turns over the most.  \r\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason she turns to a Kiva loan.  This is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the previous one she bought groceries, snacks, and vegetables in greater volume in order to get discounts.  This capitalized her business a little more.  Now she will look to make it more profitable because she has added cell phone plans and recharges, which means a new income for her. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use part of her Kiva loan to strengthen her communications business by adding new cell plans and recharges.  This is exactly what she will do so that her Kiva loan will be potentially successful.  This is because it will gradually impact the growth of her store with a new service.  She will use the other part of her loan to pay for her daughter\u2019s semester at the university.\r\n\r\nThis is why Mercedas says to her lenders, \u201cThank you for the support.  In my situation of not being from this place, I am managing to get ahead with my family, and this is thanks to Kiva.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1013.67,"image":{"id":1285094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

His wife is a homemaker and is raising their children, but during the free time helps her husband.\r\n\r\nFeeding large horned cattle is their traditional family business. Sirojiddin buys a calf and feeds it during the year and then sells to the butchers who sell it a higher price on the market. At this time the headcount of cattle has decreased because two cows got sick and he had to sell them quickly to the butchers. Now he wants to increase the cattle headcount, feed it and then sells it at spring time for a good profit.\r\n\r\nSirojiddin plans to use the loan to buy large horned cattle and expand his business.

Omar ha tenido que educar solo a sus dos hijos Charly y Ximena de 11 y 7 a\u00f1os respectivamente, ellos son la raz\u00f3n por la cual cada d\u00eda este hombre, sin duda esforzado, se levanta para trabajar duro y as\u00ed llevar el sustento a su hogar. Por varias circunstancias adversas, vive solo con sus hijos en Los Bancos un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Pichincha, una de las provincias  m\u00e1s grandes en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Este cant\u00f3n se encuentra a pocos kil\u00f3metros de la ciudad de Quito, y tiene diversidad de bosques, adem\u00e1s sus barrios est\u00e1n poblados con gente amable y costumbres propias de esta ciudad en donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentran establecidas varias microempresas administradas por los emprendedores que luchan por hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os cada d\u00eda.

","en":"Omar is 31 years old and has been working since he was a child, helping his parents.  However, he never neglected his studies and succeeded in completing secondary school.  Omar has had to bring up his two children alone.  Named Charly (11 years old) and Ximena (seven years), his children are the reason that this strong man gets up to work hard and support the household.  As a result of various bad circumstances, Omar lives alone with his children in the Los Bancos canton, in one of Ecuador's biggest provinces, Pichincha.  Only a few kilometres from the city of Quito, Los Bancos has a variety of forests and its neighbourhoods are filled with friendly people and local traditions.  Many microbusinesses are to be found here, all run by entrepreneurs that fight every day to make their dreams a reality.  Other important industries in the area are agriculture and cattle raising.  This produces an abundance of crops which are later sold and distributed to many different provinces.  The canton also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, paths and seaside resorts where tourists come for adventure sports that can practiced safely here.\r\n\r\nOmar sells wood.  He learned this trade with his parents from a young age and it later became his living.  At the beginning it was difficult to enter the market as obtaining the necessary permits is quite difficult.  However, Omar did not give up and kept going until his business was set up.  Now he has been doing this work for 15 years, working at least ten hours a day locating, carrying, cleaning and polishing wood.  The tools he uses are worn out and he now needs to buy new ones.  For this Omar needs a loan, so he has asked for help from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who, thanks to Kiva and to all of you, will be able to help this father offer a better product to his customers.  As a result, he will increase his customer base and, consequently, his income.  This will allow him to provide his children with an upbringing based on values and excellence so that one day they can contribute to the social and economic growth of Ecuador."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975.24,"image":{"id":1285108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber

As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group.
