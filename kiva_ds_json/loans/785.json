is a 29-year-old lady and is married to Hendro, a 32-year-old man. They have two children namely Satrio, a 7-year-old elementary school student and Risty, 2 years old. To assist Hendro in meeting their household necessities, Martha runs a broiler business. The business location is separate from her residence. She has been running the business for more than 10 years. Martha usually buys chicks and fodder from the supplier; she needs two weeks to raise the chicks and sell them to the customer.  \r\n\r\nMartha intends to buy more chicks to be raised since recently hundreds of chicks died because of disease. She was so sad about the situation but she did not despair. She wants to restart the business. Now she needs capital to do so, therefore she is requesting a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 3,000,000. She plans to spend the loan on chicks and fodder. Martha is hoping that her loan application will be approved by TLM soon.

She lives with her family which consists of her husband and their two young children.  The couple care for the children in their own home.  Soledad fell pregnant at a young age but she doesn't feel disappointed at all as she had the strength and courage to grow, work and give her life direction.  Her children are the greatest treasure that she has.  For this reason, she wants to do well and be successful so that she can provide them with a good quality of life.  They are still young and she is already saving up.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning, Soledad goes out to sell fodder near her home.  All the people in her community know her and they know how hard-working and tenacious she is.  For this reason, they do not hesitate to buy feed from her for their animals.  In the afternoons, Soledad goes out to her farmland where she cuts the alfalfa that she will sell the following day.  She says that she has to buy entire plots of land sown with alfalfa.  Her plans are to increase the quality of her fodder and to sell it wholesale as she knows that she must think big if she wants to do well in life.\r\n\r\nThis is Soledad's second loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her aims.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time.  Soledad enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Soledad will invest the money she has requested in buying more plots of land sown with alfalfa to stock her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":998806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

He likes to be a livestock farmer very much and he confesses that each time he can, he asks for assistance from the technicians and engineers who buy his animals for their projects.  Now he can choose the best bid because they not only buy his animals, but he also takes them to livestock markets in the city where he can supply his stock by not having to buy more animals from the animal dealers in his community.  His wife also sells milk and makes cheese that she sells in the same community to the visitors who come.\r\nHe belongs to the united group \u201cLos Huari\u00f1oz\u201d and this is his fourth loan with MFP.

The two have 4 children that they care for in their own house.  During the day she performs diverse activities.  In the morning she is dedicated to washing and ironing typical petticoats in a well known store of her city.  There she obtains a monthly income.  In the afternoons, after feeding her smaller animals, among them guinea pigs, chickens, hogs and ducks, she harvests potatoes or any food that the farmers sow that are mature and ready to be taken from the land.  Her husband also works as a operative or laborer in diverse sown fields, just like her.  But her main economic activity is the breeding of guinea pigs, which she takes care of with a lot of dedication and personal concern.  Her secret is to feed them with elaborate grasses concentrated with first quality vitamins that she herself devises.  This permits her to have healthy animals with a high amount of vitamins and proteins.  Now at the festivals they remain without compare, therefore she sells almost all of them.  Because of this, her project is to enlarge the quantity of guinea pigs.  She belongs to the supportive group called  \"walking toward the future\" and this is her fifth loan with MFP.  With its contribution, she hopes to continue with her objectives.  She also promises once more to comply with the payment schedule.   It pleases her to be part of her association because all their members are supportive and responsible people.

She is a hard-working woman who is dedicated and has a great desire to get ahead. She is married to Eliasar, who is currently unemployed. She has one daughter, who in turn is the mother of a son. Together they live in their own home. Rosaura's business is selling food, such as juanes [chicken and rice wrapped in bijao leaves], tamales and fried chicken. She operates this business in the evenings, setting up a table in front of her house, where she serves all of her customers, who are mainly her neighbors, in a very friendly manner. She has run this business for 3 years, and she has her daughter's help with the work of preparing and selling the food. \r\n\r\nShe likes her business, since thanks to it she has been able to escape from many economic hardships. In addition, she can stay in the comfort of her home without paying a lot of expenses. On the other side, she is unhappy when it rains a lot, because sales become very difficult since her stand is on the sidewalk. Still, she has achieved good results, and because of this she plans to open a restaurant in her home, setting up a space to provide greater comfort to her customers. This will be her second loan with the MFP institution, and she hopes for a small loan so that she can achieve her goals. At the same time, she comments that she likes the work her communal bank is doing, because of the support it provides to the people. \r\n\r\nWith the amount she is requesting, 800 Peruvian new soles, she will invest in buying ingredients to prepare her foods, such as rice, sugar, cooking oil and others. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, sugar, cooking oil and meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T04:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T04:00:21Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosaura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":140.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":165.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.79,"local_amount":140.77,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386426,"comment":null},{"amount":58.42,"local_amount":155.79,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":157.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099523,"comment":null},{"amount":60.87,"local_amount":162.32,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":163.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713668,"comment":null},{"amount":62.06,"local_amount":165.48,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":166.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202556,"comment":null},{"amount":65.86,"local_amount":175.64,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":177.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098241,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

His goal down the road is to buy his own house where he can install his store. \r\n\r\nSince his customer base has grown, there are some seasons when he doesn't have enough capital to meet demand, especially in the first third of the year when he needs money to buy medicines in bulk. This is why he's accessing a Kiva loan, to make this investment and take advantage of the season, making it more probable that his investment will be successful.

Now she has a business where she does a few things related to accounting and administration. She started a small store where she sells groceries, beer, sodas and propane tanks. She knows that this job requires a lot of discipline and that's why she works from 7am to 10pm, during which she attends around 25 people.

After trying several businesses without success, he started selling various products (cooking oil, salt, spaghetti, soaps, etc.).\r\n\r\nHe has a spot at the new market, and his clientele is mainly made up of housekeepers. He is very much in demand from customers, thanks to the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago, he decided to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, in order to meet an ever-increasing customer demand. He's seeking his fourth personal loan.

Married and the mother of two children, she lives with her two children at her father's house in Sikasso (the third largest administrative region of the republic of Mali). For approximately the last ten years, Mariam has bought and sold 'pagnes' (traditional printed cloths), bedsheets, shoes, embroidered materials, brooms, etc. She conducts this trade from home and on a mobile basis in the town of Sikasso, where she is much sought after by her customers for the quality of her products. To meet the needs of her ever growing customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. Following several group loans with an association of women from her area, she is now taking her third personal loan, with which she plans to purchase 10 traditional outfits, 20 pairs of shoes of various quality, 5 embroidered full length outfits and some brooms.\r\nShe buys her goods locally, and also in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso). Accepting cash or credit, she then sells them retail, by going door-to-door, to a customer base composed essentially of women. \r\n\r\nAll her previous loans have been fully repaid. With this loan she anticipates a monthly profit of 185,000 CFA which will be used essentially to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her

He lives with his wife and 4-year-old son in their own house which they have built through hard work.  He learned his trade from an uncle who used to take him to work with him when he was a little boy.  He began working as an assistant, then decided to become independent and bought an overlock sewing machine to start his business.  He has a display point in the center of town where his wife has rented a space to offer telephone, photocopying and cell phone recharge services.  The shoe workshop is set up in his home.  Also, on weekends they sell fast food.  His wife covers a large part of the household expenses and takes care of her obligations.  With her sales, she covers operating costs and family expenses, and the additional income is for any extra payments or to make purchases.  William handles a significant stock of products and raw materials for casual shoes.  His accounts receivable have a short turnaround time and his profit margin is adequate for this type of business.  Currently he is requesting a Credikiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, in an aim to buy raw materials to make school shoes and women's shoes for the upcoming school season.  William wants to produce new school designs and increase his sales volume this season but he did not have the working capital to meet his goals and therefore requested the loan.  He is confident his plans will be successful because experience shows that in the first months of the year there is an increase in school shoes

Her business is selling soft drinks and merchandise from her own home which is located in a neighborhood in the south of the city.  In her business, she sells cold drinks and small electrical appliances which people order from her.  She buys for cash and sells on credit in accordance with her customers' orders.  Right now, her growing customer base is making orders and she must first recover her portfolio (money which is in the hands of customers who pay for their merchandise through monthly or fortnightly payments) so that she is able to respond to them in a timely manner.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (the first loan she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).\r\n\r\nDiana will use her loan to buy soft drinks in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that Carnival season is approaching and this is a time when her sales increase.  She will also buy merchandise which her customers have ordered in order to enjoy Carnival such as ladies' accessories, footwear, etc.  Diana's goal for the future is to turn her business into a soft drinks store where she can also sell a variety of merchandise, in a very commercial area which is separate from her home.  While she works towards this, she maintains a return on sales (operating margin) of no less than 23% and an accounts receivable turnover of eight days.

She is the owner of a very well located beauty salon.  The main services she offers are massages and body scrubs.  She started her business working from home after finishing her studies.  Gradually, with discipline, she managed to buy fixed assets and locate her business in a space where she could offer her services to a community which would initially consist of her existing customers.  She had good results there as friends, neighbors and people who she had been recommended to started becoming new customers.  They noted her potential and recommended her.  \r\n\r\nDiana currently plans to buy the supplies she needs to carry out massages and body scrubs, wholesale, but she wants to buy for cash and in larger quantities than she is used to so that she can obtain good discounts.  Diana's dream is to add aerobics classes to her existing offerings.  Her greatest challenge is buying products in larger volumes because they are expensive owing to the good quality of the brands that she uses on her customers.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use her loan to buy cleansing creams, cosmetic creams and massage creams in larger quantities so that she can continue increasing her good return on sales.  She will also invest in making some structural improvements to her business which will provide her exclusive customer base with more comfort."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":998858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy cleansing creams, cosmetic creams and massage creams in larger quantities.

She lives with 35-year-old Miguel, with whom she has a three-year-old son. They live together in a house she owns. She devotes herself full-time to working and to raising her son. Crhis sells soft drinks and beer to people of legal drinking age. She also sells food. She displays her merchandise in her refrigerator daily. On weekends, she sells typical food from that region and from other areas, since she has a lot of experience in the kitchen.

At first he started working with people around the neighborhood by sowing part-time, but for the past six years he has worked by himself. He sells his produce in the local market of the town of Esteli. His brother helps him work; together they harvest and sell the crop. When they're not sowing, they sell milk and livestock.

Day after day he goes to his farm, which is located a few meters from his home, where he begins his daily labor. He owns 18 hectares (almost 44.5 acres) divided into three different types of cultivation: corn, rice and cacao. He has a good market for each product and is one of the farmers whose crops are most anticipated.  He has learned a great deal in his 30 years dedicated to this work and he continues to learn more every day, knowledge that  he is now trying to teach his children.\r\n\r\nEulogio enjoys his work because he can dedicate time to his family as well as being able to share with them what he has learned. He still remembers when he was very young, only 13, and began to help his parents in this work. Consequently he knows that being a farmer is very complex and he now wants to be able to improve his income and provide his children with a good education.

They have 2 children together.  They own their home which is located in the Llochegua district.  When you are doing something that satisfies you and that you like, it is good to pursue it as a career, and that is what Freddy is doing.  He tells us that he used to be a driver out of economic necessity.  However, he didn't feel very satisfied, so he left that job to cultivate cacao and coffee.  He has been doing this work for 7 years and earns good money thanks to his tireless efforts and continuous dedication.  He usually works with the support of his dear wife, but during the harvest and maintenance periods he needs laborers who help speed up the work.  Freddy is happy with this job as it has allowed him to buy a home.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He promises to make his payments on time.  With the 3000 new soles he will contract laborers to help him fertilize and clean up his fields.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":998967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.

is Jamelie. She is 56 and a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is a widow with two children. \r\n\r\nShe, together with her children, manages her own household, while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJamelie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. \r\n\r\nShe earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJamelie hopes her business will grow more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

He's single with no children, and he lives alone in his own house. He is responsible for looking after his parents, so he works very hard every day to make sure they are comfortable in their own age.

This will be his third loan with MFP, with which he hopes to continue working towards his goals. He also promises once again to meet his payments on time, as he has in the past with the other loans he has received. He is very happy being part of his group; he is the founder and always hopes that things go well for them as they work hard to grow stronger and to keep on being good customers.

is a 33-year-old man who is married to Yohana, a 29-year-old lady. They have two children from their marriage: James, a 7-year-old and Akhilas, 6 years old; both are attending elementary school. \r\n\r\nTo generate income for his family, Damianus works as a salesman. He initiated the business four years ago by using his own capital. Damianus purchases stock from the supplier such as shampoo, bath soap, medicines, coffee, milk etc to be distributed from one shop to another. He works from 9 am until all his stock is sold out. He rides his motorbike in running the business every day. \r\n\r\nRecently, Damianus expanded his business by selling a kind of cosmetics but he could not provide all the stock demanded by his customers. He cannot afford to buy the products in large quantity as it is more expensive than the other business stock that he sells. \r\n\r\nDamianus heard that TLM usually provides a loan, particularly for small entrepreneurs like him. Damianus then submitted a loan application to TLM. He is requesting a loan of IDR 4,500,000 to purchase cosmetics such as lipstick, face powder, nail polish, etc. Damianus is hoping that he can get the loan shortly.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.78,"image":{"id":1001910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

Regarding her life circumstances she is a single mother and has to raise her youngest daughter Tracy who is six all by her herself. Nevertheless, as her character is that of an exuberant and strong woman, she is not daunted by anything and is willing to move forward along with her daughter, who is her driving force and reason for overcoming. Every day Lia goes out very early in search of products from the wholesale merchants of secondhand clothing. From there she heads to her post on a downtown street surrounded by many people who are doing their shopping. There she takes the opportunity to display her products for sale. Additionally, when she isn't making many sales at her stand she heads for the nearby hamlets or pueblos in order to sell her products or exchange them for poultry. She has been doing this work for four years and enjoys it a lot since she is in charge of her own schedule and occasionally may travel. It's going very well for her since she sells a lot, and more when she sells in other places. She hopes to keep working and making progress little by little, and thus in the future to set up a clothing shop. \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy that they would offer her financial support so she can increase her working capital. She knows she will have to be very responsible and above all highly punctual. With the requested amount of 2,000 Peruvian soles she will purchase more items of apparel since she wishes to pass through the hamlets and pueblos which is where she sells more, and so makes better earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":999380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase more clothing.

He initiated the business one and a half years ago using his own capital. This business is really vital to Hengky as it enables him to cover his family's living expenses.\r\n\r\nThe increase in market price and demand for more stock from the customers led Hengky to seek more money to buy various items. Unfortunately he does not have enough capital for business improvement. One day, he got information from his neighbor about TLM. He then submitted a loan application and requested a loan amounting to IDR 5,000,000. Hengky plans to spend the loan on petrol, cigarettes, more snacks and soft drinks. Hengky hopes that his loan application will be approved
