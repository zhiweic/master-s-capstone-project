Villagers, nearby residents and passengers waiting for public transport usually stop at the tea-stall for tea, 'puri', toast, boiled egg, and omelette. Her love for work is appreciated by the group members as well as by villagers. Household expenses are borne by her as her husband's income is mainly used for their children's education and other family expenses.

\n\n","en":"Dilorom is 40 years old. She learnt to sew women's clothing in her childhood home. Her profession was very useful to her when she got married. Her first marriage was not unfortunate, as her husband drank a lot and beat her up. After the divorce she survived through a difficult period. In this period she earned money for living by herself. \r\n\r\nAfter five years Dilorom got married for the second time, and found happiness. She helps her husband provide for the family, as her husband's income is not enough to support the family.

Durante su vida productiva trabaj\u00f3 en varios talleres de confecci\u00f3n, pero cuando a uno de sus hijos le diagnosticaron una seria enfermedad, ella decidi\u00f3 independizarse  y mont\u00f3 el taller de confecci\u00f3n en la casa donde reside, para estar al cuidado de su hijo y de su madre de 85 a\u00f1os de edad. Tristemente su hijo ya falleci\u00f3 pero, con el apoyo de su familia ha sabido llevar su dolor y ha seguido adelante.

For 43 years, she has learned everything related to sewing, taking courses at different institutions, because she has always liked everything to do with handicrafts. Also in that time, it was very common for women to carry out that kind of work. During her working life, she worked in various sewing shops, but when one of her children was diagnosed with a serious illness, she decided to become independent and started the workshop in the house where she lives, in order to care for her child and her mother, who is 85. Sadly, her son passed away, but with the support of her family, she has been able to manage her pain and move forward. \r\n\r\nCurrently, her main customers are businesses who hire her to make diverse products. She works long days, starting at 7:00 am and into the wee hours of the night, depending on the amount of work she has, in order to complete the orders on time. Ana is asking for the loan to buy a serger and finish paying off a tabletop machine that she was buying in installments. With this, she will improve her installed capacity to improve her production times and speed up the process, which will help her turn in her orders quickly. She will have the possibility of increasing her customer base and therefore her income, with which she can continue meeting her household expenses.  Ana, with her entrepreneurial spirit, motivated by her family and with the enthusiasm to keep moving forward, fights tirelessly to achieve her dream of expanding her workshop, so that she can create more jobs and increase her sales. This way, in the medium term, she can buy her own house and give her family greater comfort and a better quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":140.95,"image":{"id":1431105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a serger and to pay off a tabletop sewing machine that she was paying off in installments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65437},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67246},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":69105},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71015},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72978},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74995},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77068},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79199},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81388},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83638},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85950},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88326},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90767},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93276},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95855},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":98505},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":101228},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104024}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.81,"local_amount":65442,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65885.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807492,"comment":null},{"amount":35.71,"local_amount":69118,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":69586.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095583,"comment":null},{"amount":34.74,"local_amount":67256,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":67711.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074636,"comment":null},{"amount":36.69,"local_amount":71072,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":71553.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009832,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-23T02:45:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607845,"name":"Robinson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Robinson es un joven de 20 a\u00f1os de edad que, luego de culminar sus estudios secundarios, decidi\u00f3 buscar la opci\u00f3n de generar ingresos para aportar a la econom\u00eda de su hogar, pues debido a la inexperiencia laboral no le fue f\u00e1cil emplearse; por ello decidi\u00f3 comenzar a comercializar solteritas con crema, trabajando de Lunes a S\u00e1bado durante todo el d\u00eda, esta actividad la conoci\u00f3 gracias a un amigo y, actualmente se ha convertido en su principal fuente de ingresos.

Next to her house she owns an irrigated plot of land where she grows corn.  At night, she also works as a custodian.  She makes a small income.  She is 57 years old and lives in the Spitamen district.\r\n\r\nThis is how she starts her day: she wakes up early every morning and goes to her farmyard to milk her only cow.  Her father taught her how to take care of animals, a lesson which has come in handy all her life.  With the help of her daughter and daughters-in-law, she sells about six liters of milk every day. \r\n\r\nSalomat is the mother of five children (four sons and one daughter).

She may look fragile but she is actually quite strong and courageous.  She is a woman who was able to achieve everything by herself.  It is the second time that she is taking a loan with HUMO and Partners.  She used her first loan to buy dried fruits for resale.

She had to assume the roll of wage earner for the well-being of her family.  She started selling fried snacks, which gave her the opportunity to earn money to support her children.  As her children grew, Luz had even more expenses to cover, and she couldn't do it just selling snacks.  She went to the \"colmenas\" (small sales stalls) downtown and got a job working in one of them.  Two years later, with the experience she gained at the market, some saved money and some money borrowed at a high interest rate, Luz decided to go out on her own.  She invested in the purchase of footwear and made herself known to her customers and to her suppliers, who started providing her with credit.  When her business became a bit more established, Luz was able to put together some money and rent a \"colmena\" where she sold a lot of low-cost merchandise for a time.  Once she got organized with her husband, he purchased display cases so she could work near her children, who then numbered three and needed her closer by.  Although she at first worked at both businesses, in the end Luz decided to stick with the one set up in her home.  And that is how the corner shop she has today was born.  \r\nThe shop is located in her home, and she sells a little of everything.  Luz has built up a clientele, with which she is well-positioned.  Luz's current goal is to expand her business.  Her stock rotates quickly, and in future she wants to take full advantage of her infrastructure by offering a printing service.\r\nLittle by little, Luz is taking important steps.  When she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the first time, she purchased wholesale, overstock and cash merchandise such as footwear, clothing and cosmetics.  Luz is currently requesting a \"credikiva,\" with which she will purchase wholesale, overstock and cash merchandise like clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics etc.  She wants her financial backers to know that she is very happy with the loans.  The support has made it easier for her to improve her family's income, and she holds hope for a better future.  With her \"credikiva,\" Luz plans to increase her sales and her profits, as she has a fixed clientele that in increased shopping times, like the second half of the year, make her investments very successful.

With her Kiva loan she was able to purchase rice in bulk, oil and two more washing machines to rent. Today she is obtaining additional earnings by renting the washing machines which enable her to have greater solvency. Her business is better established in different locations and now she is better able to help her husband with this new business.\r\n\r\nAlcira says to her funders: \u201cThank you for giving us the opportunity by supporting us in the business, which gives us the chance to work every day.\u201d Currently she is applying for a new Kiva loan with which she will purchase more washing machines and food supplies in bulk for her lunch sales.

At a very young age, he began attending rehearsals for various musical groups and discovered that he had a talent for music.  Shortly thereafter, he was hired to teach classes in different towns and also began giving private lessons on his own so that he could generate income to support himself.  With some of his savings, he bought a sound system that he rents out for different events.  This provides additional income so that he can meet his basic needs.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of his experience and knowledge in this field, Anderson has now become a singer-songwriter.  Within a short time, he also decided to start a music school so that he could become financially stable.  He offers classes in voice, guitar, percussion, and piano.  In addition, he rents out a space that different groups can use for their rehearsals.  \r\n\r\nAnderson is a vigorous and active man who possesses an enterprising spirit, which has enabled him to make gradual progress.  He strives tirelessly to fulfill his dream of seeing his music school become one of the best and among the most recognized.  However, he is aware that he must work hard, with dedication, and with great effort.  This has motivated him to request the help of loan, which he will invest in the purchase of musical instruments (guitars, a piano, a percussion set, xylophones, and recorders).  This will expand his capacity so that he can accommodate more students, which will have a positive and direct effect on his finances since he will have more income.  In addition, he will be able to improve his quality of life.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":130.95,"image":{"id":1431019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to buy guitars, a piano, a percussion set, xylophones, and recorders for his music school.

For three years she has been making a living selling vegetables (potatoes) in a small market.  She tells us that her customers are loyal, thus she earns a profit to cover household costs.

For this reason, he has applied for a loan. From its profits, Hoshimjon hopes to build a house, since his old house is falling apart.

story of Sariman, son of Rosmini:\r\n\r\nMy favourite subject is computer and networking. My reason to choose this vocational study is I want to be a computer expert, especially a programer. The hardest part for me is the way from hometown to school, because the road is broken and difficult to pass on it. I am pleased because most of the teachers are good and friendly. At this school I joined the student football team. I like play football very much. Having many new friends is something fun for me.\r\n \r\nThe condition of my family is poor. Truly, I am apprehensive about my future and the continuity of my study. My hometown is Menganti village, in Cilacap regency. We stay at a very unpretentious house. All the walls are made from bamboo, and the floor is still soil (no stone, no brick and not coated with cement). Actually it is not proper to be lived in, but we have no other choice. \r\n\r\nThe financial condition of my family is not good. My parents are only poor farmers. Their salary per month is around Rp 500,000. Their money is not sufficient to fulfill the family daily necessities, moreover my school fee. The number of children in my family is three. They are 13 years old (at junior high school), 16 years old (me\/vocational high school) and 25 years old (married).\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to thank to Kiva lenders who are willing to lend me funds. The Kiva loan can lighten the financial burden of my parents.

fee.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1429086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

story of Defri, son of Ari:\r\n\r\nI like entrepreneurship lessons. With them, I know about the entrepreneurial world and how to build a business. Besides that, I am also eager to learn computer knowledge. I want to know everything about computers.\r\n\r\nMy village is Tritih Wetan, Jeruklegi subdistrict, Cilacap Regency, Mid Java Province. The hard thing for me is the far distance between my hometown and school. Moreover the transportation vehicles are still rare. \r\n\r\nThank you, Kiva. With the loan given to me from Kiva, I can continue my study. Formerly, I almost dropped out and gave up because my parents cannot pay the school fee. \r\n\r\nThe condition of my house is unpretentious and almost broken. There are many holes in the roof, so when the rain comes, you can see many waterfalls in my house. My father is a laborer and his salary is around Rp. 500,000 a month. The number of children is two. They are my younger sister (13 years old), and me (15 years old). We are students. This loan can improve the financial condition of my family. After graduation, I want to be a computer technician. I want to repair many computers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1429167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

","en":"Ainagul is 46 years old.  She is rasing two children together with her husband.  The spouses started their own business in selling flour in 2003, using a starting capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Having developed her business and obtained regular customers, Ainagul now has an average monthly income of 15,000 som (KGS).

Dinara has a secondary education and currently works as a cook at a kindergarten. To provide an additional source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 1,000 som (KGS).

He lives in Bolnisi district with his wife and son. He has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood since his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Aivaz was unable to start a professional career. Aivaz works hard on family-owned, agricultural land, growing maize, haricots, and potatoes. He always has high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price.  \r\n\r\nSince the family only has seasonal income, Aivaz decided to open a grocery store and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nA start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Aivaz's application was approved under the framework of this program, allowing him to receive a loan of GEL 2,000. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, he will renovate a space located near his house and purchase a stock of groceries. Aivaz thinks that the business will be profitable since it is in a great location and is the only business of this kind in the area. \r\n\r\nAfter the general store is opened, the family will have a stable income, which will enable them to cover everyday costs and expand the business in the future. With the support of the start-up program, Aivaz will get an opportunity to be involved in his own business and tackle the financial difficulties.

She then goes back to her house and gets organised so that she has everything prepared, then goes out to the pavement outside her house at night to sell her food. She has a little cart where she prepares the food. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for 4 years now and she works on her own. What she likes about the work is that it gives her time to carry out her household tasks and she is able to care for her younger children who still need a lot of looking after.

In the future she would like to have a shop selling products and be able to make more income from home. \r\n\r\nTherefore this is Lecy's second loan with Kiva; it is going well for her and she hopes it will stay that way.

She can invest it in her breeding business to gain earnings and save profit for her family\u2019s life. \r\n\r\nHiep is a hardworking woman and is passionate about business. She has participated in SEDA's microfinance program since 2012. In the last loan cycle, she borrowed 5,152,000 VND and repaid on time.

Sadly, due to a lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Iago was unable to study for a professional career. Iago has a cow, a pig and two calves. Marina milks the cow every day and produces dairy products for selling. In addition, Iago works hard on the family-owned land, where he grows nut trees. He always has high-quality nuts, which he sells to local retailers for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs the income is too small, Iago decided to start a nut-trading business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. This startup program, which is joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Iago's application was approved under the framework of this program for a loan of 2,000 GEL. With this loan he will purchase a stock of nuts and then resell them at a higher price. This will increase his income and he will be able to expand his husbandry business and generate more income.

It is composed of eight members and is governed by a board of directors of which Alicia is president. The businesses carried out by the members of the bank are diverse and include braiding and weaving blankets, making sandals, selling dishes, selling lubricants, making tools, selling snacks, and selling food.\r\n\r\nThe loan Alicia will take out will benefit small micro-businesses of which she is a member. She indicates that two years ago she became a member of Pro Mujer after she was invited to join by a friend who is already a member. Currently, she runs an electronics shop. She started this business to support her current partner in the contracts that he had, learning the trade. To expand her services, she began to make independent contracts.\r\n\r\nAlicia is taking this loan out to increase capital.

They work every day starting very early in the morning and they spend all day there since their business is outside their house, where they have set up their small enterprise. Their sales are very good since their business is right on the route between Portoviejo and Manta and Jipijapa. Lots of people pass by on these routes, so their sales are very good and this gives them what they need to move forward. They have been in this business for more than two years. This loan is to buy supplies to prepare the food. She is the founder of the communal bank and she likes it because of the help that they give to her and her fellow bank members. Her dream is to provide the best for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1431773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies to prepare food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T20:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T20:10:07Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1158.32,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":144.79},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":144.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":144.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":146.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410966238,"comment":null},{"amount":440.62,"local_amount":434.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":440.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857976,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506345,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":289.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":293.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730102,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T23:13:13Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:10:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608247,"name":"F\u00e1tima Livida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Las Luminosas  se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el  en el sitio las Palmas del Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, lugar conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional. \n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora F\u00e1tima, tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene tres hijos de 11, 7 y 3 a\u00f1os,  los dos mayores  estudian en escuela.

Her work brings in much-needed money for the family; as the children have grown up, and the family's monetary needs have increased, she is a big help to Zayniddin.  In this year in particular, he has had financial difficulties due to his third daughter starting college, in addition to having to pay for his second daughter's tuition for the year.  Zayniddin always strives to do whatever possible to provide for his children and fulfill their desires; at the moment, though, it looks as if it will be difficult to pay for his second daughter's education.  Thus, Zayniddin has turned to Arvand, hoping to receive a loan to pay for her tuition, and would like to thank Arvand in advance for their financial assistance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.29,"image":{"id":1421556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay his daughter's tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T20:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T20:20:12Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zayniddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":82.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":84.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":88.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":93.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":95.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.24},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":99.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901000,"comment":null},{"amount":82.08,"local_amount":82.08,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550182,"comment":null},{"amount":84.21,"local_amount":84.21,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":84.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774404,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T06:19:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606597,"name":"Nadzua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadzua is a married woman with three children, one underage and two who attend school.

","en":"Urmatkan is 41 years old, a widow, and has three sons and two daughters. After her husband's death, she became the sole breadwinner for the family. Urmatkan was searching for a source of income for her family, and thereby began selling groceries. She started her business with 1,000 KGS in 1995. She rents her grocery shop. Through her hard work, Urmatkan was able to develop and expand her product line. Her business brings in about 15,000 KGS per month, which pays for all of the food and household needs of the family. The income generated by her business has allowed Urmatkan to expand her business. In order to further develop her business, Urmatkan approached the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 130,000 KGS to buy wholesale food products for resale. The income from the loan will help Urmatkan increase sales in her grocery store. The resulting profit will help her raise and educate her children well.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":579.39,"image":{"id":1429969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

clothing. He used his previous Kiva loan to purchase goods. Thanks to the increased sales volume, Vitaliy was able to get an additional income and pay the fee to the college where his eldest daughter studies. \r\n\r\nVitaliy continues to increase the number of sales points for his goods. He rented several additional selling spaces at the market.

She will buy vicu\u00f1a wool from wholesale stores in the city of La Paz and once made will sell to the firm to order.  This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her home as possible since she\u2019s in a common law relationship and has four children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers the health area because it has a medical office.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1231.62,"image":{"id":1428799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy vicu\u00f1a wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-17T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-17T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":129,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestino\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelia Ang\u00e9lica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25864,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2408.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3002.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3084.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3168.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3254.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3343.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3434.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4169.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":484.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":604.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":349.16,"local_amount":2408.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153710,"comment":null},{"amount":435.26,"local_amount":3002.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615282,"comment":null},{"amount":447.2,"local_amount":3084.36,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3089.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-21T13:29:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608736,"name":"Miguel Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miguel es un hombre de 21 a\u00f1os, es soltero, vive en la ciudad de Pisco con sus padres y hermanos, el es muy trabajador, entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por salir adelante; gracias a su esfuerzo y al apoyo de sus padres, el se encuentra estudiando la carrera profesional de Administraci\u00f3n de Empresas.\nPor iniciativa propia, Miguel trabaja en una empresa de transporte de su ciudad, el trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 8 horas y cree que le va bien por su buen desempe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n.\nMiguel se encuentra muy agradecido con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada comprar\u00e1 un separador de ambiente y realizara mejoras en una habitaci\u00f3n de su hogar,de esta manera desea brindar mayor seguridad y bienestar para su familia, as\u00ed pues el seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de ser un buen profesional.
