When asked how this loan will benefit her family, Paulina replied that it will help her to give her children the best education.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Paulina owns one or more cows and a bicycle, but does not own a pig, poultry, pump, motorcycle, or automobile.  Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, or DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117.9,"image":{"id":1382494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy goat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Muranga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-07-04T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-03T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1475.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1514.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1554.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1595.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1638.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1681.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1725.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1771.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1818.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1918.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.45},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1471.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820300,"comment":null},{"amount":18.88,"local_amount":1510.23,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1621.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417399,"comment":null},{"amount":19.38,"local_amount":1550.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1664.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980910,"comment":null},{"amount":19.89,"local_amount":1591.12,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1708.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880962,"comment":null},{"amount":20.41,"local_amount":1633.18,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1753.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529582,"comment":null},{"amount":20.95,"local_amount":1676.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753458,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-04T19:14:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":579307,"name":"Andrea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andrea, 54 years of age, is married to a construction worker, and they have been blessed with three, school-aged children.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I am the fourth generation in a family dedicated to Zapotec weavings. I remember as a child watching my father working on the loom while my mother and grandmother carded and dyed the wool. We shear the fleece, spin it and dye it with tints from the cochineal insect, pomegranate peel, bark from the huajal tree that thrives here, as well as oak and pecan bark. Stones, dried flowers, almost all the rocks and flowers here yield natural colors. My wife and I work together in our home. We help each other, and in this way we can finish our rugs sooner. I especially like diamond motifs, as they represent a kind of maguey coat of arms seen at Monte Alb\u00e1n. They exemplify my Zapotec heritage.\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all, I want to thank all of you who help fund these microcredits, which benefit people like my family and me.

The house they live in has vulnerable walls and, during the winter time, strong winds and frosts chill the family members down to their cores. So she is applying for a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to buy vacuum-insulated windows, fiberglass and foam. Installing vacuum windows and insulating their walls with fiberglass and foam will ensure that the house will no longer lose its heat through its windows and walls.

Each of them is eager to improve their lives and families and they believe they will be able to do this through their businesses, despite the difficult economic situation in Guatemala. The group is composed of a diverse collection of businesses that includes small stores selling daily need products, clothing sales, shoe sales and even a Christian bookstore.  \n\nGabriela Cecilia is one of the members of the Mujeres Negociantes. She is a young single mother with a 4 year-old son, whom she has been raising on her own for the last three years.  Gabriela has an 8th grade education.  Two years ago, her mother gave her Q500 (US$65) to host a birthday party for her then 2 year-old son. However, instead of investing in a party, Gabriela Cecilia took the money and bought blouses and pants to re-sell, igniting her entrepreneurial spirit. She realized that she and her child\u2019s need went beyond a one day event and she thought if she could make money on the money given to her by her mother, she would be able to provide for herself and her son. \n\nSince that day, Gabriela has continued to be involved in the sale of clothes. Her dream is to increase her stock of products and add lingerie to her business as well as purchase her pants in blouses in bulk. She currently has a profit of Q639 (US$83) and works 2 hours a day Monday thru Friday, averaging $1.38\/hour.  Her business plan shows that with a loan of she will be able to improve her stock of lingerie, blouses and pants.

Her sons are married and have left home). Ides was born near La Laguna and grew up with her parents. Her father was a traditional fisherman, and her mother sold her father's fish, as well as other people's fish. Ines learned this job, and with the passing of the years she developed a relationship and had two children. In the end, she was unable to live with her partner and became single again. After some time, she met someone new and is now in a long-term relationship with him. They have been together for 20 years. At one point he emigrated illegally to the United States. They were able to build the home in which they now live, in the northern zone of La Laguna, on land which is owned by the government. It's an area that was created from the hardening of a layer of volcanic lava, and they built their home with the state's permission when her spouse returned from the US. They then opened a small store and started raising chickens in December. They also raise laying hens. In general, they have 200 laying hens. Her spouse works as a security guard at city hall.\r\nThis loan which she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is for the purchase of 300 Hy-line red laying hens, 11 weeks old. They decided to increase the number of animals they have because of demand for their eggs, and they do not have the money to feed them. They buy their chickens in the city and have to pay someone to make the voyage; they pay $20 for each voyage of about 15 kilometres from their home, and then they have to walk, which increases the cost because of the uneven ground leading to their home.\r\nWith this loan, she will have money to buy chicken feed and to satisfy the dietary needs of her current batch of growing chickens. What she makes from 200 hens is not enough to cover the costs of the rest; 200 hens lay about 170-180 eggs per day given their cycles. If they grow well, this group will definitely start to lay at 17 weeks as expected, and production will be homogeneous with healthy and strong animals.\r\nShe hopes to increase production with this new group of 350 chickens, which will replace the 200 hens. She hopes to have a better income for her family because her spouse's salary and their income from their store barely covers their family's costs. Next year, their costs will be higher because their 15-year-old daughter should start high school, and she will have to travel every day. What's more, their 17-year-old daughter is pregnant, and the baby's father is not taking responsibility for the pregnancy. Their 5-year-old granddaughter will have to start kindergarten; next year there will be more costs, so they will have to work harder.\r\nIn the future, Ides hopes to improve the farm equipment, especially the structures. The birds currently live in a laminate house and are entirely closed in with little natural ventilation. One day, she hopes to have special housing for them with hanging water and food dishes, and everything better organized. She hopes that her girls will go to university so that they can live differently."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1383412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

En esta ciudad encontr\u00f3 un ambiente propicio para vivir y emprender su propia aventura de negocios, con el cual ha logrado obtener su vivienda y el sostenimiento de su hogar. Cuando se inici\u00f3 como comerciante, lo hizo con una tienda que poco a poco fue ampliando, pero ese negocio lo convirti\u00f3 en refresquer\u00eda, debido a que la tienda demandaba mucha operatividad y esfuerzo y disfrutaba muy poco de su familia y el tiempo le ha dado la raz\u00f3n, pues adem\u00e1s le ha permitido generar ingresos para que sus hijos logren estudiar y esto para el y su c\u00f3nyuge es muy importante.

He has done this since arriving in the department of Cesar 17 years ago looking for a way to bring his family peace and well-being. His family is his wife and their four children between the ages of 5 and 19. In this city he has found a favourable environment in which to live and launch his own business venture. With his business, he has been able to obtain a home and sustain his family. When he started off as a businessman, he had a store which he expanded bit by bit. He has turned this business into a refreshment stall because the store required a lot of labour and hard work, and he was not able to enjoy his family very much because he had no time. This refreshment stall has allowed him to generate an income so that his children can study; this is very important for him and his partner. He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his ninth loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, Pedro will buy pop, national drinks, juice, and beer wholesale and with cash. This will allow him to stock up and have a good inventory to get through the permanent price increases of these products. This is why his loan will be a successful investment. It will allow him to save by getting special prices based on volume. He anticipates that the prices on the products he sells most will increase.\r\nWith his loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n, he has been able to acquire fixed assets such as his freezers, and to stock his business effectively. Because of this, his customers always find what they need; this has been good for Pedro, because he has ensured their loyalty. His goal for the future is to acquire a proper storefront and to expand his market in order to increase his income. He hopes to achieve his dream of familial well-being in the future.\r\nWith his previous loans he bought pop and drinks, which increased his inventory and generated greater utilities. With his income from his business, he has been able to strengthen his savings and acquire his own home. What's more, his daughter is studying in university. \r\nHe is now applying for a new loan with which he will reinforce his stock with greater volumes of beer and pop. These are the products in highest demand and they rotate easily.

","en":"Odiljon is a 46-year old man with an optimistic, positive life outlook. He is married and has three children. He and his family live in the rural area. Odiljoin has graduated from  the university with a degree in architecture. Now he works as an architect for his region\u2019s administration. His wife is a homemaker: she is a good wife and caring mother. Every day she takes care of the household needs, takes care of the children and bringing them up. Odiljoin needs to work a lot in order to support his family. Sometimes he works late at night in order to finish his projects. Even though this work brings in a good income, this is insufficient to provide for all the family needs. He also would like to improve the house they live in.

She has five children (three daughters and two sons). She has secondary education. After finishing high school, Parizat worked as a courier until the collapse of the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nIn 1995 Parizat started working with agriculture and livestock breeding, after having started a business with 5,000 som (KGS). Parizat's husband helps her in her business. Thanks to Parizat and her husband's persistent work, today they have a good business: 200 sheep and milking cows. They also have 4.34 hectares of irrigated land available, where they mainly grow beans. The income made it possible for Parizat to multiply the number of livestock on the farm and thereby increase the well-being of the family.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Parizat turned to our microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of six sheep. Parizat plans to invest the income from the loan in her children's education, and also to build a new house. The family is very friendly and ambitious."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1383800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has secondary education. \r\n\r\nTogether with her husband she started a farming business many years ago with a small sum of 15,000 som (KGS). Her husband earns money providing different services to the population, while Elmira has seasonal work in a bakery. At the farm they have three dairy cows, three calves, one sheep and one horse. The monthly income is 8,000 som (KGS) from selling milk from the three cows. The income enabled Elmira to multiply the number of livestock at the farm and thereby improve the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Elmira turned to our microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a horse. Elmira plans to invest the income from the loan in repairing her house and also for the education of the oldest daughter.

The livestock breeding business was started with 25,000 som (KGS). Faniya's husband helps with the business. Thanks to Faniya's persistent work and her education as a veterinary, the farm today has two dairy cows and one calf. Further they have 1.40 hectares of land available, on which she plants clover every year. The harvest is used as fodder for the livestock. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Faniya turned to our microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of steers.

Sadly, he was unable to attend university due to the lack of economic resources which is why he strives daily to provide a better future for his children.\r\n\r\nThanks to his spirit and drive to get ahead, his economic activity is selling basic grains and agricultural supplies.  He spends about 10 hours daily selling his products.  The objective of the loan is to invest in working capital and to buy products like basic grains, rice, beans, sugar, peanuts, sorghum, cereals and cocoa so that in the not too distant future he\u2019ll earn better income.  Oscar Iv\u00e1n is grateful for the support Kiva lenders give to people of scarce resources and to poor countries like Nicaragua so that they can have a way to earn a living with dignity.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1369538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy stock merchandise for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-07-05T23:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-04T23:10:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":579706,"name":"Marwan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marwan is a 30-year-old single man from Lebanon living with his parents and two siblings.

is a single mother, aged 27 years, with three children who are 9, 7 and 3. Two of her children are attending primary schools. She is a businesswoman who operates a retail shop and is also trading in bark-cloth (traditional attire). She supplements her income with agriculture from which she earns twice in a year. She has been in these businesses since 2011 and she works 7 days a week, and each day she works for 12 hours. \r\n\r\nHer businesses are located in a rural setting. She started these businesses in order to get money for taking care of her children by providing them with daily food, paying their school fees and providing their other needs.\r\n\r\nResty has acquired this loan in order to restock her business and be able to serve her clients better. She sells her retail shop goods to people around her area.

Se cas\u00f3 muy joven y tuvo dos hijos a quienes tuvo que educarlos sola despu\u00e9s de que sufri\u00f3 el abandono de su esposo hace 13 a\u00f1os de quien no volvi\u00f3 a saber nada y este acontecimiento le llev\u00f3 a aprender varias actividades en el \u00e1rea comercial para buscar el sustento de su hogar. Ernestina al poco tiempo de haberse casado con quien ahora es su ex esposo; se traslad\u00f3 a la ciudad de Quito capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador en donde se encuentran muchas personas migrantes de las diferentes provincias del pa\u00eds que han llegado hasta all\u00ed en busca de nuevas oportunidades. Ernestina vive en Quito en la parroquia de Yaruqu\u00ed, ubicada en la periferia del cant\u00f3n, que guarda en su historia grandes tesoros de los antepasados incas que habitaron el lugar. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os la parroquia ha crecido y las viviendas se han multiplicado pero cabe destacar que las actividades que se realizan con mayor vocaci\u00f3n son las flor\u00edcolas y av\u00edcolas sin dejar de lado las actividades industriales, de comercio y servicios en especial el turismo, actividad con la cual se muestra a turistas nacionales y extranjeros los lugares donde habitaban los incas, una pir\u00e1mide significativa y una gruta que lleva a un santuario. \nErnestina se dedica desde hace 2 a\u00f1os a la comercializaci\u00f3n de ropa casual para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os; labor que la aprendi\u00f3 por sugerencia de un familiar y comenz\u00f3 vendiendo de puerta a puerta a sus amigos y conocidos, actualmente esta mujer se ha superado a s\u00ed misma logrando establecer su negocio en un peque\u00f1o local en el pasillo de su casa y al cual le dedica hasta 10 horas cada d\u00eda. Actualmente la variedad de productos que tiene ha reducido, para lo cual solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra exclusiva de ropa de temporada para todas las edades, el beneficio adicional que ella obtendr\u00e1 ser\u00e1 un descuento mayor al acostumbrado, pues al comprar mercader\u00eda en mayor cantidad le otorgan un mejor precio con lo que obtendr\u00e1 utilidades mayores, las cuales usar\u00e1 en el mejoramiento de su estilo de vida y adem\u00e1s ayudar a su hijo que a\u00fan vive con ella en la obtenci\u00f3n de su t\u00edtulo profesional. Esta mujer encontr\u00f3 en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa el apoyo, asesor\u00eda y confianza que estaba esperando para dar el paso de crecimiento en su negocio. ","en":"Ernestina is 41 and was born and raised in a chilly rural town in northern Ecuador. She married very young and had two children, whom she had to educate on her own as her husband disappeared 13 years ago. Ernestina never heard from her husband again and learned various businesses in an attempt to support her children.  \r\n\r\nShortly after she married her now ex-husband, the couple moved to Quito, the Ecuadorean capital. They were among many migrants from across the country who came to Quito seeking new opportunities. Ernestina lives in Yaruqu\u00ed Parish, on the outskirts of Quito, a region rich with treasures left by the Inca people who lived there. In recent years, Yaruqu\u00ed Parish has grown, with burgeoning  construction of new homes. The major economic activities, however, are still flower and poultry production, though commercial and industrial ventures, and especially tourism, are also significant. Tourists from Ecuador and abroad come to see where the Incas lived, a magnificent pyramid, and a cave that leads to a shrine.  \r\n\r\nErnestina has for two years sold casual clothes for men, women, and children. She learned the business at the suggestion of a family member and began selling door-to-door to friends and neighbors. Ernestina eventually gave up selling door-to-door and set up a shop in her home, where she works ten hours a day. She currently carries a smaller variety of clothes than she used to, and she is requesting a loan for the exclusive purchase of seasonal clothing for adults and children. These loan funds will also provide Ernestina another benefit: they will allow her to make wholesale purchases at lower prices than she has paid before. The greater the volume of inventory she buys wholesale, the lower the price her suppliers charge her, increasing her profit margin. Ernestina will use this extra income to improve her quality of life and help the son who still lives with her finish his education. \r\n\r\nErnestina has found in the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa the support, advice, and trust she was seeking to help grow her business. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1383371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase seasonal casual clothing.
