Getting this loan will offer Marwa the necessary home appliances which will make her daily life go easier and create better living conditions for the family. \n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext.\n \n\n

In search of a source for financial support for her family, she started her own business of fattening up and reselling livestock ten years ago, using an initial sum of 12,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, Nazgul's business currently yields about 8,000 som per month from sale of milk and meat products.  In order to further grow her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase bulls for fattening up.

He breeds sheep and cattle and has 15 years of experience in this field. During these years, Javanshir has acquired the knowledge and skills required for the business. He purchases lambs and calves in the central livestock market and raises them. Sheep raising takes about 3-4 months and cattle breeding takes 5-6 months. After fattening the animals, he resells them for a profit in the Imishli livestock bazaar. Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like <i>pilau<\/i> and <i>dolma<\/i>. His business requires a lot of physical strength and Javanshir spends most of his time in the open air. His wife helps him to feed the animals. \r\n\r\nJavanshir's monthly income is 300 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) and Javanshir wishes to increase it. As meat is in high demand, Javanshir needs more capital to put into his business to cover the market. For this purpose, he applied for a loan of 1800 AZN. He will use the loan to buy 10 sheep, two cattle and one cow. He has already demonstrated himself to be a good client with a positive credit history.\r\n \r\n

This group is in the fourth cycle; all women are working, struggling and living hard lives.  One of the members is Mrs. Patricia, who tells us that she sells recycling, this is very hard work, and she has to go traveling the streets looking for products that are recyclable. She is very proud of what she does, it is a decent and honest job and because of this she can give her family everything they need.  She is requesting a loan for the purchase of recyclable materials in quantity, to resell and have a little more profit.

When she is not at the school, she goes to one of the most important parks in the city of Pucallpa.  She has put a great deal of effort into ensuring her business is one of the most popular with the customers.  The customers prefer to buy from her because of the kindness she displays when she serves them.  In addition to selling in this location, she also has a small but very well-stocked grocery store in her home which her husband takes care of.  Over time, they have been able to find a way of working together so that they can both make income for their household.\r\n\r\nThe five years that Elida has spent working in this business have enabled her to gain a preferential location in the park as her stall is located in the busiest corner where it is much easier to find her.  What she enjoys about her business is chatting to her fellow traders.  What she least enjoys is having to stay on her stall all day without being able to go anywhere.  She hopes, in the future, to set up a candy store which will make her better income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Elida's 11th loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support so that she can continue increasing her working capital.

This is the way he manages to support his family with the peace of mind that they lack for nothing at home.  His constant motivation to excel led him to enter this business and he has made himself very well-known over time because he sells the freshest and most delicious fish at the market.  He is a pleasant salesman who always greets his customers with a smile. \r\n\r\nHe also rents a vehicle, which provides him with additional income.  At first it was very complicated for him, but in time he became more capable.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his work is talking with his customers.  He has been doing this business activity for four years.  He considers the most difficult part to be putting up with the intense smell of the fish because it permeates his clothes.  He hopes in the future to have a vehicle that is set up to allow him to transport his products without the bad odor.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his third loan with MFP.  He is very happy to know that he will have financial support.  That way he will feel certain that his business will advance.

In his free time, Mario Alberto enjoys building houses. Peru is well known for having some of the most delicious foods int he world, and one of the dishes that Mario Alberto enjoys is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" (a combination of a pasta dish and a beef or pork stew that are often served together).

His business is successful because he does his work in a responsible and honorable way, and because of this, many people comment on his good work and recommend him to others.

She always worked as a salaried employee but because she wanted to stay home with her daughter she resigned.\r\n\r\nBecause she\u2019s always enjoyed being economically independent she took some courses to learn how to cut and color hair and how to apply other chemicals and how to do manicures and pedicures as a way of earning income that will allow her to be independent and help with family expenses.\r\n\r\nAt present, she provides styling services at her customers\u2019 homes to women who request them.  She organizes them based on prior appointments preferably during the time her daughter is at school during the mornings and up to about noon.  In the afternoon she tends to her daughter and her household chores.\r\n\r\nThis loan is important for her and for her business\u2019 development because she wants to affiliate herself with a firm that distributes the products so that she can qualify for discounts and have product inventory on hand which will mean better prices and more liquidity.  Her goal is to attain a stable, competitive business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":953864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

She has been in business for a year and has earned a good income for her household.  Before having this job she was always dependant on her husband's income and sometimes it was not enough to cover expenses.  Now she has extra income which allows her to have food on the table since they do not have to pay for breakfast or dinner.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys what she does because she especially likes cooking.  She has many plans for the business but for now only wants to save capital and use it to expand in the future.
