They are five micro-business women from San Pedro de Macoris, from a batey (a company town) surrounded by sugarcane fields where they live and work for their families. They are selling clothes, miscellaneous products, shoes, groceries,  food, etc. She lives in a simple home with her family, which is comprised of five members: her children, her long-term partner, and herself. \r\n\r\nElsa is associated with Esperanza and started with us because she needed capital to start a business. She is very excited to be receiving her 10th loan from Esperanza Internacional after having sucessfully paid off her previous loans, and having taken steps to grow her business.

The Trust Bank is located in a small town called San Jose Xepatan, Patzun, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, which is a very agricultural area. The majority of the inhabitants grow vegetables like green beans and broccoli. Within the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank, five of the women are engaged in agriculture, another woman sells fruit, two ladies have convenience stores and one member operates a tortilla-making shop. All of them are also weavers. \r\n\r\nMaria is on her fifth loan with Friendship Bridge. The 54-year-old has never attended school and is divorced. She has six children, and four of them are still at home. Maria is an entrepreneur and works hard every day to support her children. She buys and sells vegetables and fruit, traveling to the market, which is located 20 minutes from her home, to sell her products on Tuesdays and Fridays from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. During the rest of the week, Maria and her family work in the field growing green beans and broccoli. Maria only started selling fruit five years ago, but her business is growing, which allows her to dedicate more money to raising crops. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s dream is to expand her businesses so that she has a larger variety of products to sell. She wants to use her income to help her younger children continue in school; most of her older children only have a sixth-grade education. With her new loan, she will be purchasing seeds for planting more green beans and broccoli, as well as purchasing fruits and vegetables for resale.\r\n\r\nLike Maria, the other eight women in the Mujeres Benditas Trust Bank are so thankful to have the support of KIVA investors. The women realize that KIVA investors work hard like they do and appreciate that others are willing to share their earnings with women in Guatemala so that they can create better opportunities for their children.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to increase his output. \n\nThe agricultural sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending for agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

While it is a fairly quiet community, the town has a variety of bustling commerce activities. In the West Village of Patzun, the Trust Bank Mujeres de \u00c9xito (Successful Women) was formed four years ago and currently has nine determined women in the group, all of whom identify with the name of the Trust Bank. The vast majority of women in this group are engaged in hand weaving, selling screws and selling fruits and vegetables. They are all neighbors and know each other well.  \r\n\r\nMaria Magdalena is a member of the Mujeres de \u00c9xito Trust Bank. She is 50 years old, married, and has eight children (four of them still live at home). Thanks to Maria and her husband\u2019s hard work, all of her children were in school until the heavy rains hit Guatemala last year and her oldest child, who was in college, had to drop out. Maria Magdalena only has three years of education, because her family couldn\u2019t support her schooling anymore. Maria learned to make huipiles (traditional blouses) when she was a child, and over time she learned the styles from other places. She now makes different styles of huipiles from different areas. She also learned how to make chocolate (a product that originated in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, where she is originally from). Maria Magdalena travels to Antigua, Guatemala (two hours away from home), Monday through Saturday and sells her products from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. She also sells her products in Patzun on Sundays.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, Maria Magdalena will buy fabric and thread to make huipiles. She will also use the materials to make aprons since her orders are on the rise because the Easter season is fast approaching. She will also use her loan to buy more ingredients to make chocolates so that she can keep up with demand (she has many orders for chocolates as well). One of Maria Magdalena\u2019s goals is to grow her businesses and have her children help manage the businesses with her. She also wants to help her child, who had to drop out of college, go back to school. \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful to Friendship Bridge for the opportunity to have been a client for the past four years, which has allowed her to invest in her business. Likewise, the Trust Bank that she belongs to feels so grateful to the KIVA lenders because even though they do not know the lenders, they rely on their support.

She currently rents her house.  Her husband is a taxi driver. The applicant sells eggs with potato flour and noodles in a crowded market in the city of Santa Cruz. She goes out and starts selling her food from 6 am until 10 am. By then, she has no more food to sell. She sells everything.  She has been doing this type of activity for more than two years and generating good income from it. Since she is currently renting, Lidia would like to get this loan with  this institution since she would like to create a land pawn contract (known as anticr\u00e9tico) for two rooms. This contract consists of giving a certain quantity of money to the owner for a year, and the following year the owner returns the same amount of money. The owner lives off of the interest of the money; in this way it functions almost like a loan to the owner. The customer thanked the institution for the opportunity and at the same time appreciated  how fast she was offered

Indira is busy with agriculture, which is the main source of the income for the family. She grows maize on the family-owned 1 hectare of land. Maize is sold on the local market and brings the family on average 200 Laris per month. This income is hardly enough for feeding family members. \r\n\r\nIndira requested credit for starting up an agricultural business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with easy conditions for country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Indira will start up a dairy farm. She will purchase four milk cows. Cows will be placed in an old cattle-shed, located in Indira\u2019s yard. She will produce on average 100 kg of cheese, 90 of which will be sold on the local market, to dairy products retailers. The income of the family will increase by 500 \u2013 600 Laris, which will mean 150 \u2013 200% increase.

They have two milk cows and produce cheese to sell at market. Iason sells an average of 35 kilograms of cheese at the local open market per month. \r\n\r\nLali has requested credit for the purpose of building a greenhouse. The new business will be an additional source of the income for the family, which will allow them to combat the poverty in which they live. Lali\u2019s loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program offers business start-up capital and re-startup credit with generous lending conditions to country rural poor, who often do not have access to credit as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lali will purchase materials for greenhouse construction (iron pillars and polyethylene covering) and will then construct the greenhouse, where vegetables and greens will be grown throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nLali and Iason will work in the greenhouse themselves. They will sell their harvested produce at the local open market. The income of the family will significantly increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

After 4-5 months she will start the sale of hens. Hens will be sold on the open market of the nearby town by Leila. She will reinvest the profit for further expansion of the farm.

\n\n\n","en":"Saparkul was born in 1963 in the town of Zherge-Tal in the Tian-Shan district of the Naryn province (in northern Kyrgyzstan). In 1982 after finishing school she began as a simple laborer in a factory in Bishkek, where she worked for three years. In 1985 she married, moved with her husband to the town of Temir-Kanat in the Tong district and found work in the Tong district's manufacturing plant. Unfortunately her and her husband's salaries were not enough to cover the family's expenses. After working until 1991 and having saved up 5,000 som, Saparkul decided to begin her own livestock business, and bought a milk cow. \r\n\r\nEven as she just began to work in agriculture, Saparkul set a goal: to have a large farm and a well deserved and bright future for her children. Being by nature a purposeful, patient, hardworking woman, Saparkul was able to reach her goals. At this time she has 3 head of cattle, 20 head of sheep and one horse, an smallish sheepyard and 2.10 hectares of irrigated land from which she harvests clover, wheat, barley and potatoes annually. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Saparkul came to the Bai-Tushum and Partners company for a 120,000 som (KGS) loan, with the goal of increasing the number of livestock she has for raising and later sale. Saparkul plans to use profit from the loan to invest in expanding the sheep yard.

She has been working in trade for more than 8 years, i.e. buying and selling crockery and jewellery. She also provides services in premises located on a level of the market in the community where she has her business. She is involved in the rental of chairs. She chose to work in trade and providing services in order to combat idleness. What she enjoys most of all is the contact with the public and the financial benefits. She has been a member of one of the branches of U-IMCEC since February 2007. She has already paid back four previous loans. She is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs in order to buy new products (crockery, jewellery etc..), so that she can build the stock of her shop.

is Madel, 29, resident of Bacoor,Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Rene, her business partner, and mother to their two children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nMadel operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nMadel dreams to be able to give her children a good future and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1016059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for additional computer parts and supplies needed in her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T01:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T01:40:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3202.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269998028,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3202.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606568,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2562,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095425,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":640.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359048,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T03:09:42Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401257,"name":"Lorenzo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"25-year-old Lorenzo is a married man from Trinidad, Bohol.

lives in the village of Bandza, Martvili District, in the western part of Georgia. He is married and lives with his wife Maka, daughter, and 61-year-old mother. Datuna and Maka run the agricultural activities of the family, which is the main source of income for the family. They have a 220 sq meter greenhouse and a plot of land. They grow cucumbers and tomatoes, which are sold locally as well as in nearby villages. The family has been involved in this business for 11 years. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, they have been working hard to expand their farm. Datuna received a good harvest of vegetables last year, which was sold for a convenient price. He already covered his first Kiva loan. Now Datuna has requested credit for the expansion of the family's agricultural business. With the borrowed money he will purchase materials for greenhouse construction \u2013 wooden pillars and polyethylene cover.

She was independent since childhood and loved to help her mother to take care of the home. Lidiya got married right after she graduated from high school. Her husband was already working in the local collective farm at the time and after their wedding the farm had given them a house to live which they have bought out later. Lidiya has found a job in the same farm as a milkmaid. A year later in 1989 their oldest daughter was born and then in 1991 their second daughter. In search of an additional income for her family Lidiya started doing animal husbandry and used an amount  of 2,000 som (KGS) to start the business. Thanks to the efforts and perseverance of Lidya the income from the business allowed them to buy a new home in 2002.\r\n\r\nRight now Lidiya's business has three heifers, twelve pigs and nine sheep. Lidiya has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 60,000 KGS to buy two heifers with a goal to further grow her business. She plans to invest the income form the loan in the increase of headcount of cattle and in the future she dreams to buy an SUV.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1049532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Voznesenovka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-20T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-19T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":60823.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T04:40:44Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403081,"name":"Mirtha Iris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirtha tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 3 hijos, a los cuales cr\u00eda sola y por los cuales sale adelante  con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n porque para ella son los m\u00e1s importante que ella tiene y son su raz\u00f3n de vivir y levantarse cada d\u00eda con mucha fuerza; Mirtha vive junto a sus hijos en la ciudad de imperial, ciudad que se caracteriza por su clima c\u00e1lido, por su agricultura y por la generosidad de sus pobladores.
