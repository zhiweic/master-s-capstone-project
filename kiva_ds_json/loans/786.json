She has the task of making flan, cakes, and other snacks her customers order from her. She has been doing this work for one year and works out of a small workshop set up in the house where she lives. She works alone since for the time being she has only a few orders but down the road she will need assistance. She enjoys making pastries very much since she learned to do this work at an early age from her aunt and some other people. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP. She is very happy to know she will have financial support so she will experience a greater sense of calm while working. She promises to continue being a punctual client as she was with her previous loan. With the requested amount of 600 Peruvian soles she will purchase ingredients and supplies to keep on doing her work and fulfill the orders she has pending. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":999401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients and supplies for making more cakes.

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, she was widowed some time ago, but this did not prevent her from giving an education and good habits to her daughter Sindy, 21, whom she is raising as a single mother.  Together they live in her own home where, in addition to her daughter at her side, she also has her mother, whom she wants to give a better quality of life for her old age.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Juliana saw that work was the way to stand out in this competitive world.  She did all types of jobs until one day, thanks to a friend who invited her to a fish sale in a market in the city, she discovered that she could do this job and that she liked how it worked.  Also, it would allow her to have time to be with her daughter and, even better, have an income for her finances.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing her job for ten years, and she learned a lot from all the experiences she had.  In her job she is very well loved by her fellow workers because she always has a smile and an encouraging word for her friends.  She has lots of plans in mind but for the moment what she most wants is to be able to continue working, and later be able to set up a grocery store in her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be her eighteenth loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have some financial help because this way she will feel more sure of making progress with her work.  She also promises once more to make the payments on time, as with the previous loans she had.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1000 PEN she will buy more variety of fish, with the goal of beginning to sell in greater quantity and variety.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":999373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a greater variety of fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-09T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-10T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":152.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":158.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":164.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.24,"local_amount":152.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":153.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386446,"comment":null},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":158.32,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":159.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099548,"comment":null},{"amount":61.58,"local_amount":164.22,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":165.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713690,"comment":null},{"amount":62.01,"local_amount":165.36,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":166.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202581,"comment":null},{"amount":70.25,"local_amount":187.32,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":188.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098265,"comment":null},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":172.15,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":173.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T09:11:36Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389994,"name":"Najah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Najah is a 39-year-old married woman from  Baqa\u2019a, Jordan and she is a mother of six children.\r\n\r\nNajah is selling blankets, clothes and accessories, through her home-based project.

Maritza is a widow, and this is the key reason she has had to provide for all the needs of the household.  Now she is working very hard so that she can provide a better quality of life for her minor daughter.  Maritza has been running a lathe workshop (a place where they repair linear motors) for more than 14 years; she hires 4 workers to do the heavier work.  She likes this work very much, because she considers herself to be a good administrator, and she always has the contacts she needs to have a good business.  In addition, she is able to offer employment opportunities to more people, and this is gratifying.  She hopes to continue with her work, but she needs to make an investment in some tools and other equipment that she needs.  This will be her 3rd loan with MFP, and she is very content to know that she will have financial support, because in this way she will feel more sure that she can make progress with her business.  On her part, she promises once again to continue to make all of her loan payments as scheduled.  She is very content to be working with the other members of her communal bank, because they are all very supportive and responsible.

Ana Luisa says that a little less than a year ago she opened a small convenience store in her home with the support of her husband in order to earn extra income and help him with household expenses and their children's education. She works every day out of her home, opening her store at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m., and she enjoys having a well-stocked store so her customers can always find what they're looking for. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of beans, rice, oil, cookies, candy, soup, drinks, cheese, cream, milk, salt, sugar, ham and canned goods to restock her business. She hopes that with this investment her business will attract more customers and she can continue growing her store.

The climate is hot and there are many rubber trees scattered on the outskirts of town. Mrs. Guadalupe, or Lupe as her friends call her, is 43 years old and only completed primary school. She is married to Delfino who works in the bakery. They have seven children, of which 5 are already married. Of the youngest daughters, one is a single mother and the youngest is in high school. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that more than 22 years ago, she and her husband started to work making and selling bread. When they started, they had an oven to make \"pan de piedra\" (rock-shaped bread). The oven uses wood, but a couple of years ago, they received some monetary support and were able to buy a gas oven, a big mixer and a tray to grow and improve her business. They have always worked selling bread and they get up very early to start making the bread to sell it to the women who take their children to school very early.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates a small barber shop for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her child a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Unfortunately she looked after her twin daughters alone, since they were three years old, as her husband passed away. After going through this sad situation she spent her time caring for her young children alone. A lot of time has passed since then; her children are now grown up and with a lot of hard work she has been able to give them the education that they needed. She devoted herself to trading and to providing education in the afternoons to other children with the aim of generating income.\r\n\r\nMaria is a woman who likes to prepare sweets and she makes a living in this activity in her free time. Like a good Peruvian she is a fan of all spicy dishes and she enjoys them a lot. She currently lives in the city of Mala, located to the south of the capital of Peru, Lima. Mala is characterised by its lovely and generous inhabitants of this beautiful little town.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate income Maria decided to set up a bookshop - a bazaar. This shop has been open for approximately 5 years, long enough to have taught her a lot about her business. She tends the shop from 6:30 in the morning until 8:30 in the evening. During this time she serves an average of 18 customers. Her customers always come back and she is sure that it is because of her friendliness and the variety of products she offers. As another activity she sells \"Colado\", made from sweetened beans, which she sells weekly to her customers who live near her house.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva's loans, Maria will be able to buy school supplies and uniforms, and gifts to stock her bazaar. She will also buy some supplies to prepare the colado that she sells. She hopes to be able to increase her sales thanks to the festivities that are celebrated until the month of May. All this effort and business vision will lead her to increase the quantity of her products and so also increase her income as well as being able to save in order to later extend her business, to buy display cabinets, scaffolding and other items. Her dream is to be able to see her business grow and to see her twin daughters married and completely happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":998173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to

","en":"Kulmira is 52 years old, married and has three children.  In search of an additional source of income for her family, she started her own business of reselling agricultural crops in 2002.  Kulmira used an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) for the first purchase of potatoes for resale and was able to develop her business to have a working capital of 30,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from the business allowed her to purchase a UAZ car to transport potatoes.  In order to further grow her business, Kulmira requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover.  In the near future, she also plans to use the profits from the loan to make repairs to her home and continue to expand her

is married with four children.  They live in a four-bedroom house with one person per room at Mbomasa, a quarter in Bamenda Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. He has faced challenges in life such as deaths, sickness and accidents of family members.\r\n\r\nHe joined GHAPE in 2005 and has taken and successfully managed and repaid his loans four times with no major difficulties .He has been investing  his loan in a corn mill, grazing of animals and farming of crops. Given a new loan, he will expand his activities. He will buy more cattle, hire a herder who will take care of the cattle and buy seedlings for his farm. He strongly believes his business will succeed because he has a large piece of land where his animals can graze, the dropping will be used as manure for the farm products and he will buy a good breed of cattle. From this activity, the community will benefit from the droppings and from the sale of food crops like cassava, corn and beans, which he will harvest from the farm and sell to them at moderate prices. He will make sure the crops are available at all times.\r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used for employment of more workers to work on the farm, for the education of his children, and for the addition of rooms to his house. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the low interest rate, the education they provide on loan management and marketing techniques given to him by GHAPE.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1002776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
