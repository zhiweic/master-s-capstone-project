Today, Zoya's business contains 3 heads of purebred dairy cows and 15 heads of sheep.  Sales of milk and milk products yield about 25,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zoya requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a purebred dairy cow.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a purchase of technology to improve her farm's functions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1061309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T22:50:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":428.57,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":20064.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095491,"comment":null},{"amount":1071.43,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754594,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-17T00:52:12Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:21:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410300,"name":"Lavenie De Ferrier 2, 4 & 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Belius est le coordinateur de son groupe Lavenie de Ferrier 2, 4 & 6.

The rest will be invested in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1060181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-31T00:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-30T00:00:17Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamedi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251961,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449089,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268474,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102929,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624784,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":67694.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922471,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-04T22:01:54Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409066,"name":"Jackelin Marlene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jaqueline, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en la venta de tortillas, comprara ma\u00edz y gas propano que son los materiales necesarios para la producci\u00f3n de las tortillas.\nElla considera haber tenido un efecto positivo con los pr\u00e9stamos anteriores fortaleciendo sus ventas y mejorando poco a poco sus ingresos familiares.\n","en":"Jaqueline has decided on a new loan to invest in her tortilla sales; she will buy corn and propane gas which are the materials necessary to make tortillas.

made up of nine humble, indigenous people from a marginalized town named Santiaguito.  There are many green trees there, and the majority of people dress in \"huipiles\" [traditional embroidered dresses] and do not cover their breasts.  The majority of men in the community make a living by harvesting corn.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is se\u00f1ora \u00c1gueda, who is 31.  She has sold chickens and fish for 3 years.  What she likes most about her job is plucking the chickens and cleaning the fish.  She tells us that she goes out to sell them to the houses in the community in the mornings and afternoons.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is a widow and has 5 children:  Aurelio, Jose, Maria, Liliana, and Isabel, who are her biggest treasures.  They are her inspiration and strength for getting ahead.  One of her dreams is to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more chickens and fish to sell wholesale and retail.  She tells us that selling chickens is the most profitable because it's what her compatriots like a lot.\r\n\r\nShe tells us about one of her experiences:  what she first started to sell was chickens, she bought them little by little and went out to sell them to houses.  With her profits, she bought fish and stopped selling chickens.  But thanks to the support of the foundation, she bought more chickens and fish to sell.  Selling fish also makes good profits for her, but not more than the chickens.  She tells us that she is happy to have two businesses since these profits help her children with their education.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the foundation for helping good and indigenous people.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nCarmelita \u2013 who sells beef\r\nPablo - who sells beef\r\nJulia - who sells chicken\r\nMargarita - who sells embroidered clothing\r\nAlicia - who sells bread\r\nSonia - who sells bricks\r\nMarcelino - who sells Mexican comfort food\r\nEdith - who sells bricks.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to the foundation for helping good people who have the desire to improve themselves, get ahead, and fulfill their dreams.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelma operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells ready-to-wear clothing for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Celma is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCelma hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Single, he manages the household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLolito operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nLolito hopes to be able to expand soon.

The 32-year-old owns \"Klassy Kidzs Resale and Things\", a Sainte Genevieve resale shop with an inventory of newly-purchased, name-brand items. \u201cI don\u2019t sell junk,\u201d Jennifer says. Her store carries clothing for sizes between newborn and young men's pant size 36, along with a variety of educational toys, furniture and accessories, such as the $90 Jessica Simpson shoes she\u2019ll sell for $25. Some items are from her closet that her children never used or wore, or used and wore a couple of times; all without rips, stains and scratches. Nothing in Jennifer\u2019s shop is donated except for prom dresses she receives from the community. Jennifer is networking with a community school district to donate the dresses to deserving high school students. She plans to do this annually.\r\n\r\nWith a business plan in mind, Jennifer called St. Louis\u2019 directory assistance, which then connected her to Missouri\u2019s directory assistance and informed her of ACCION Texas, Inc.\u2019s newest location. Soon after, she applied online and was approved for the first ACCION loan of Missouri. Since then, she referred two friends to ACCION.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a boss,\u201d Jennifer says. Instead of making money for someone else with her knowledge and skill, she says, \u201cI\u2019d rather be the one making money.\u201d This pushed Jennifer to open her shop as she did on March 6. She is the only worker at the moment and she plans to keep it that way. This adheres to her plan of working for herself and making her own money.\r\n\r\nThe ACCION loan helped Jennifer pay for unexpected expenses, such as rent, the store\u2019s deposit, a cash register, checkout counter, sales racks and advertisement. Jennifer\u2019s children, ranging between 14 and five months, were her inspiration to open her shop. She says the ACCION loan \u201cactually helped me open something that\u2019ll help my community and achieve something I actually want to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":1058493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is Marilyn, 48, a resident of Bacoor Cavite, Philippines and a mother to her children. Her husband, Norberto, is a driver.  She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, The driver remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP25, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to to buy spare parts for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams to have another vehicle in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
