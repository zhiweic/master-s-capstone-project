Greetings from Sierra Leone! This is 43-year-old Alpha from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. He is a married father with six children between the ages of 2 years and 20 years old. His children are attending school. \r\n\r\nAlpha runs a spare parts business; he sells motor oil, transmission fluid, brake kits and electric fans. He has been running this business for 13 years. He works at the business from 7:00 am until 7:30 pm, 6 days per week.

They live in a four bedroom apartment house in the Bamenda Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life, among which are inadequate finances to effectively carryout her business activities, paying her children's fees, and providing three square meals to her family.\r\n\r\nOlivia Meseh has taken and successfully repaid her loans twice and says that with this new loan she will expand her poultry farm by buying more chicks and feeders, building more cages, and also buying a new motorbike, with part of this loan added to her savings from the last loan repaid. Olivia Meseh holds a positive view of her business succeeding because she has been doing this business for a long time. The transportation business will enable community members to carry their produce form the farms to the market, transport children to and form school, and carry workers to and from work.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Olivia Meseh will engage in poultry farming, help with her granddaughter's education, and take care of other necessities in the family. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rates and convenient repayment intervals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":122.52,"image":{"id":1368897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

The members live in Meru, near Mt. Kenya in Eastern Kenya.  The region is very productive for dairy farming due to the favorable weather conditions.  Most families in the region have between two and ten cows, and therefore the sale of milk becomes their main source of income, alongside potato farming.\n\nThe women of Kairuni are very hardworking and take care of their families from the little income they get.  However, they are highly challenged when it comes to getting fuel for cooking.  Their homes are not connected to the electricity grid, and purchasing LPG gas is too expensive for them.  They therefore use firewood, charcoal, and kerosene for cooking and lighting.  It costs between $25 and $58 US to purchase charcoal and kerosene each month, and firewood from the nearby forests is highly guarded and restricted to ensure conservation, so getting firewood is also a challenge.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, VEP taught them that they could install biodigesters and use cleaner, better fuel that is also efficient without incurring on-going costs.  To enable them to undertake this project, they have all benefited from this loan and construction has been initiated.  With a biodigester, they will have increased savings that enable them to repay the loan and improve their lives.  They can also spend more time with their families in place of the time previously spent collecting firewood.  Bioslurry from the biodigester will also come in handy to replace commercial fertilizers in potato farming, hence increasing production and ensuring food security.\n\nThe group is usually represented by Madam Amaria who is seated second from the left. She is the group chair and the most educated. She is also the one who motivates and urges the group to embrace change. with her leadership the group will grow through many other projects as well.\n\n

age 25, is a maize farmer. She grows maize on a half hectare of agricultural land, then harvests and sells the produce locally. She lives in the small village of Lagodekhi District with her two daughters and grandmother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Their income barely provides enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTamara would like to start up a family dairy farm business. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up purposes, but without success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nShe has now requested a loan from Credo to start up the family business. She has been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

He lives in a small village of Bolnisi District with his wife and mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Rapig requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a 0.8 hectare of agricultural land, where potatoes, maize and cucumbers are grown. They sell the harvested products at local markets at a good price. In addition, his wife trades in clothing. It is hardly enough to feed the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRapig requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

Since its initiation in the year 2012, the group members have saved together to buy water tanks for their families. They have been using the merry-go-round system, though, so only 10 of them have received the water tanks as they are only able to buy one tank per month. Their problem is not only water. Since most of them cannot afford to install electricity in their homes, they are forced to buy kerosene for lighting and firewood for cooking. Having partnered with Visionary Empowerment Programme, they have learned that they can benefit from a more affordable credit scheme to enable them to access quality renewable energy products.\n\nAs a result, they have all benefited from a loan to purchase a solar package for their home and an efficient cookstove. The solar package will enable them charge their mobile phones and use a small radio as well as save them from  buying  kerosene again. The efficient cookstove will save them at least 50% of the firewood they had been using with traditional cookstoves, therefore easing the burden of collecting firewood daily. The cookstove also reduces smoke emission and will be better for their health.\n\nSince they are all farmers, proceeds from their farming businesses and the little they save by not buying kerosene will enable them pay the loan. Thanks to green energy technologies, more homes can enjoy improved lives.\n\nJohn and Simon, standing 3rd from left and 2nd from right respectively, are brothers in law. John is the group chair and Simon is the coordinator, positions they earned as they pioneered the group formation. They, like the rest of the group members, wish to get empowered through renewable energy products that save them money and create a better environment for their families. Their future plan is to supply the lamps to their neighbors as a business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1377316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe family owns a milk cow. They milk the cow every day, and they produce dairy products. The products are sold at the local markets. The family has some additional income, in the form of monthly remittances from Vakhtang\u2019s mother, who is working abroad. The family's total income is so small, that it is rarely enough to provide food for them.\r\n\r\nVakhtang requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Vakhtang will purchase a car. He will drive the car as a taxi. Vakhtang is a very hardworking man. He will work long hours, to earn a good profit and increase the family's income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will give Vakhtang an opportunity to improve the living conditions of his family. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1380316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To purchase a car, for use as a taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gamarjveba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T19:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T19:50:07Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vakhtang ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":220.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":228.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":234.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":244.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":248.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":251.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":257.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":260.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":270.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":274.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":279.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":284.28},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":289.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":294.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.29},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.02},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.49},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.99},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577976,"name":"Seraphine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seraphine is 36 years old.

In particular, they have a milking cow, a calf and 2 buffaloes. Besides this they have 0.5 hectares of agricultural land, where nut trees are grown. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLali requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lali has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Lali will purchase a car. She plans to begin trade of fruits and vegetables. Her husband will drive the car and transport fruits and vegetables to different villages for selling. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She has two children in different grades of elementary school. She and her husband cultivate coffee, corn, and beans. She completed her elementary school education thanks partially to her parents' financial support. Her parents also taught her to work the land at a very young age. She and her husband have farmed together for over ten years. Agriculture is a family tradition in her family and in her husband's family; in her community, it is the only source of income for all of the families, including hers.

His hometown is situated in Simanjiro, South of Mount Kilimanjaro. Like many men of his tribe, he moved to the big city Dar es Salaam to try his luck as a security guard. For his job he earns about 100 USD per month. Despite this bad income, there was something good about the job: during the time he got in contact with many English speaking people and that's why he is (apart from Maasai language and Swahili) also fluent in English.\n\nHowever, \"a real Maasai doesn't belong to big cities like this,\" Micah says, and it is clear that he wants to go back to Simanjiro, even though he has some concerns about home. One of these big concerns in Micah's home village is lack of electricity: people need to light up their houses with kerosene lamps, which are very unhealthy and also really expensive. \n\nTherefore, Micah wants to start his own social business and bring affordable solar energy to his family members and friends. African Solar Rise helped him to write a business plan and provided him with technical training as well as sales training.\n\nWith a loan we do not only empower Micah to start his own social business; we also reach all of his family members (and Maasai normally have big families!) and provide them with renewable, clean, and sustainable energy.\n\nBecause of his good reputation as a guard and our personal experiences with him during our training sessions, where he showed some admirable entrepreneurial capabilities, we are confident that the loan will be fully repaid after a little more than one year. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1381275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy

","en":"Ergashoy is an upbeat and very kind woman, 55 years of age. She is married and has one son, who works in Russia as a construction worker. Ergashoy\u2019s dream has always been for her son to receive an education and become a professional. But for the time being, due to lack of finances in the family, he was forced to go to Russia as a migrant worker. He receives a good salary and tries to send some money to his parents every month. Ergashoy herself does not remain idle, either: she is a seamstress working out of her home. She sews traditional national outfits, blankets etc. She also receives a decent income from this work. Ergashoy\u2019s husband works as an engineering technician at a car park and earns very little, but this income too supplements the family budget. All of their income is spent on everyday needs. Yet they dream of renovating the house they live in. The house\u2019s condition is unfavorable. Due to frequent rains, the roof is badly worn out and leaks during rain. This is why Ergashoy and her husband decided to renovate their house. And so Ergashoy has applied to Arvand in order to receive a loan to buy construction material and renovate her home. She thanks Arvand in advance for its support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1378799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

In the last harvest, he did not obtain the income he had expected, and this time he wants to increase production. In order to do this, he needs capital. He is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL for the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, manure, herbicides, tools, etc. He will also use it to improve the plot of land in the photo, which is where he wants to sow. Misael's references say that he has an irreproachable character, and that he is responsible and repays his loans. He is confident that he will be able to pay off the debt and, at the same time, provide his family with a full life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1381224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer, manure, herbicides, tools, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-07-01T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-31T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Misael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T09:18:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":578013,"name":"Osita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Osita is a fish vendor.

She now seeks a loan to buy six bales of secondhand clothes. She also runs a public transport vehicle which gives her extra income. She says that when it rains it becomes very difficult to get customers. The other challenge is that prices fluctuate and this sometimes brings losses. The extra income that she will get will pay her children's school fees and improve the standard of living for her family.\r\n\r\n\t

He lives with his parents and siblings in his mother's house. Since he was very young, he has liked going to school and he always wanted to support his family and pay his mother back for all of the care she gave him. That is why when he finished high school without delay he started a very short technical major that will help him work in a mine. That is where he works now tirelessly. He has very little time. he says that when he comes home after several days' work he has a lot of things to do. In addition to caring for his livestock, he buys everything they need so his mother can care for them when he is traveling. The activity he has done since he was very young is raising quality, well bred sheep. He sells them at a good price. Thanks to his mother's help, he can keep growing in this business and he hopes to keep getting more livestock and improving the quality of his sheep and be a good rancher. This is his first Kiva loan and he is grateful for the financing he is receiving. He is committed to making his payments on time. Ernesto will invest the S\/.1500 soles in buying sheep to keep increasing the number of livestock he has.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":322.57,"image":{"id":1381261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep.

He works seven days a week, and each day he works for 12 hours. He sells his products to residents in a rural setting. He also supplements his income with money he earns from a fish mongering business. This is his second loan. The first loan he acquired of 1,000,000 Ugandan shillings was added to his business helping him to purchase desired goods at the market. Due to this, he earned some more income and was able to buy a plot in his trading centre.\r\n\r\nRonald has been in the business of selling clothes since 2009.
