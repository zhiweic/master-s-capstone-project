With the passing of the years this motivated him to use what he had learned as a commercial enterprise.

Its main source of employment is retail.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe is one of the members of this group. She is 49 years old, completed secondary school, and is married to Enrique. She says she has run a small grocery store from her home for over fifteen years, and that she started her business because she wanted to make some extra money without neglecting her family. Since there were no grocery stores in her neighborhood, she thought it would be a good investment.\r\n\r\nWhat Guadalupe likes the most about her business is that she is always in contact with people and always manages to make sales. Her business is open daily from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and she would like to get a loan from Kiva and VisionFund because it would help her invest in purchasing rice, beans, oil, flour, soft drinks, cookies, soap, cold cuts, and canned goods.\r\n\r\nShe expects her business to prosper from this investment and that it will be visibly more well-stocked in order to attract more customers, increase her earnings, and improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Nelida and Anabel, who both sell cosmetics;

She is 45 years old, married and has five children as a result of her marriage, the three older children already live in other households, and there are only the two younger children under the couple\u2019s responsibility. Sonia has a full primary education thanks to her parents' support, but she was unable to continue studying as her parents had few financial resources and didn't have enough means to continue supporting her. \r\n\r\nFrom a very young age Sonia has been making her living in agriculture as this profession is a tradition in her family and is the source of income for her family. Her father took her to the fields where he worked and he showed how her to harvest the coffee. Later on he taught her how to grow bulk grains (rice, corn and beans). Together with her husband, they make their living in agriculture, growing coffee, sowing corn and beans. They have their own land which is near their home which is why from day to day they work tirelessly and yet with a huge amount of enthusiasm to tend and weed their crops with the strong belief that they will obtain an excellent harvest as this is the area in which they generate the most income.\r\n\r\nThis is why at the moment Sonia finds herself in need of money to buy agricultural supplies to technically support her coffee crops such as the purchase of fertilizers, fungicides and so on which will help them to keep the crops healthy and safe from plagues among others. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of increasing her crops; sowing and cultivating a larger amount of coffee plants and in this way obtaining a greater income that will help her get ahead with her family and give her children a better opportunity in life: educating them so that in the future they become people that are prepared and with a vision who look after the inheritance which she and her husband want to leave them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2.56,"image":{"id":1468378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies to tend to her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2.56,"local_amount":52.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710616,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T22:25:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631362,"name":"Candelaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Candelaria is 33 years old and married with three children.

Here is his story.\r\n\r\n\"Last year I was a student at International Ataturk Ala-Too University. I applied to three universities last year and was been accepted by all of them, but because of the financial limitations of my family,  I decided to study at Ataturk Ala-Too University.  This year I decided to reapply to AUCA, as I did last year (although I could not attend AUCA last year). This year I have been accepted by AUCA. \r\n\r\nAUCA gives students a chance to apply for exchange programs or the MBA program. Students of AUCA are highly qualified and it is an honor for me to become part of it now. The quality of education is very high, so the teachers are highly qualified, accordingly. Students of AUCA are from different parts of the world and form one culture at AUCA. There is a fantastic atmosphere at AUCA. AUCA is recognized for its outstanding educational system and many programs that are ranked highly across the nation. This is a university that always expands and every time becomes more advanced for its students. Knowing that the staff cares about its students, as exemplified through their persistent and constant up-grading of the school, highly influenced my decision to apply to this university. \r\n\r\nAUCA will become my home for the next four years, and the diverse cultures and comforting atmosphere of the university are things I would be proud to associate myself with. While going on tours throughout high schools, AUCA has been the one that drew me in the most. This university offers me many different opportunities and resources that other schools could not. Another opportunity that AUCA gives to every student is a Kiva loan. It is what can make dreams come true. I am applying for the loan as I have financial difficulties and am not able to cover my tuition fees fully.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1468682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Instead, Angelina worked in the field and looked after animals, such as hens, pigs, and cows.  Angelina is now married and, with her husband, works in agriculture. She is a mother to six children - two are in school and two work in farming with their parents.  The other two travelled to the US four years ago and send home a little money whenever they can.  Angelina's father now also now depends on his daughter.\r\n\r\nAngelina makes a living looking after pigs, and now has 25 years experience doing this work.  She learned it from her parents, who were very poor.  They did this work for a very long time and it, with farming, was their income.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy four small pigs, each of which will cost $50.

age 44, is from Bitaug, Enrique Villanueva, Siquijor, Philippines. She is married and bravely raising 3 children. PMPC supported her by providing the capital to start her pig raising business. She sold one pig at a time, helping the family survive. She gives her best efforts to produce good pigs, in order to sell them continuously. \n\nDonia is now trying to expand her pig business and has also decided to venture into food vending.

She's hoping that her business will continue to expand and continue earning profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":327.59,"image":{"id":1468780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase canned goods, beverages, biscuits, noodles, and candies to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Gappal, Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2013-11-13T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-12T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":192.45,"local_amount":8322.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-22T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":8351.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430505763,"comment":null},{"amount":135.14,"local_amount":5844.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-23T09:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5864.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440882347,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T20:28:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631438,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 44 years old, from Nyahururu.

She has been a farmer for many years, specializing in dairy farming. She also has a small piece of land where she grows vegetables and cereals like maize, beans and peas for their food needs,  and she gets milk from her five cows. This income is used to cater for the family needs  and pay the children's school fees. \r\n\r\nLucy, like other women in the county, has faced a lot of challenge when in comes to accessing fuel for cooking and lighting. She has to walk a long distance every weekend  to collect firewood  enough for the week and buy kerosene for lighting. After an encounter with a VEP marketing team at a farmers field day, Lucy learnt that she had a better source of fuel that was cleaner, cheaper and more convenient. She learnt that she could enjoy biogas fuel for cooking and lighting from the animals dung. To facilitate construction of the biodigester, VEP could advance her an affordable credit to be repaid in 24 months.\r\n\r\nWith the biogas Lucy will enjoy cooking in a cleaner kitchen without smoke.

With this she can continue to work and put in the effort to achieve her great dream of owning her own house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.54,"image":{"id":1468462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CHINCHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth Katherin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":65.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":71.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":73.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.02},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.52,"local_amount":65.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":68.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472905,"comment":null},{"amount":26.02,"local_amount":69.39,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":72.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695392,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T22:06:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631440,"name":"Nicanora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicanora is 76 years old and a widow with eight children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

She lives in her ancestral home, where she inherited a piece of land from her parents. Three of her children have cleared school and help her in tilling the land and looking after the livestock. The other two are in high school and only help with the house chores in the evening. \r\n\r\nAgnes and her children have been relying on the income from the farm proceeds and sales of chicken eggs, as well as sales of milk from their ten cows. This income caters to their family needs, as well as payment of school fees.\r\n\r\nTo assist Agnes to cut down some of her expenses and save some money, VEP introduced her to the biogas project, which would provide her with a cleaner, more affordable source of fuel for cooking and lighting. She benefited from a loan that enabled her buy the materials for the biodigester construction and also got excellent expertise from the biogas engineers.   \r\n\r\nShe is currently enjoying convenient cooking in the comfort of her sitting room, and she no longer needs to use the outer kitchen that was previously used with the firewood jiko (stove). Her house is smoke and soot-free, her cooking pots clean, and her health better, as she no longer inhales smoke. \r\n\r\nShe has also been trained on how to increase food production using organic fertilizer from the bio-slurry. This means that she will also save money previously used for buying chemical fertilizers, her food  production will increase, and if she sells some of it, it will be an added income to her family. Biogas will be a source of transformation and empowerment to Agnes and her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":48.96,"image":{"id":1468784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to construct a biodigester, which provides a cleaner, more affordable source of fuel for cooking and lighting, and also organic fertilizer from the bio-slurry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes Nyokabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.96,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4191.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867627,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T11:32:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630638,"name":"Soliga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soliga is a 64-year-old woman who is married with 4 children.

With the support of the Start Up program, Nanuli will get an opportunity to be involved in her own business and tackle the financial difficulties."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":45.45,"image":{"id":1468809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to begin trading in clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Rustavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-11-14T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-13T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanuli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":56.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":59.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":69.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":74.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.24},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.24},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":45.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":45.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T04:59:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":631466,"name":"Lendie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lendie is 30 years old.

Together with her life partner she works hard to get ahead, waking up early every morning to work in the field and send her kids off to school. They are in the coffee business, which helps them provide their children with clothing, food, medicines - although they are limited - and an education. She learned the coffee trade from a young age thanks to her parents, but she also makes and sells tamales in order to generate more income for their home and take advantage of the holiday season. They own their land, located 500 meters from their home, thanks to a purchase with the earnings from their coffee harvest.

Thanks to Anarjan's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow, 2 calves, 2 bulls, 15 sheep and also a 0.50 hectare land plot, where she grows clover, potatoes and corn.

All together, there are three of them, and Anarjan is the leader of the group.

Alymkan has a higher education and works as a teacher at a local school. To provide additional income for her family, Alymkan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 20 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Alymkan's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 5 horses, 50 sheep and also a 1.50 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and potatoes. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS). Alymkan is part of the \"Tash-Tobo\" group that includes two more persons. Alymkan is the third member of the group. In order to further develop her business, Alymkan requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy bulls to increase livestock headcount. Alymkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a new

She has a secondary education and raises animals as the primary source of her family's income, a business she started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now contains two milk cows, one bull, 40 sheep, one horse and two calves as well as 3.5 hectares of arable land, on which she grows beans, potatoes and hay, with a total monthly income of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nBegaiym belongs to the group \"Kelechek-Kalba\", along with two other people. With the intention of further developing her farm, she has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 90,000 KGS to purchase heifers to increase her head count.

She's married and the mother of three children.  She completed elementary school.  Her older children are in elementary school: the oldest is in elementary school, the second one's in kindergarten, and the youngest is at home because he's too young to attend school, even pre-kindergarten.\r\n\r\nRicarda liked farming from a young age.  She produces coffee, and also grows corn and beans for family consumption, and she sells pineapple.  She and her husband have a lot of experience in this job because they have learned to work together as one for the business.\r\n\r\nShe walks three kilometers every day to take care of her crops.  Her family is the main motivation for her income and her area is coffee.  Her parents taught her to farm and gave her the land that she and her husband now farm.  The two of them alone do the various tasks.\r\n\r\nThis is why Ricarda currently needs a loan to buy one liter of Alto SL and two bags each of foliar soil amendments, urea, 18-46-0 soil amendments, Nutricaf\u00e9, coffee formula, and 12-24-12 soil amendments.  With these products she'll be able to take care of her coffee plants for the season.\r\n\r\nRicarda dreams of expanding her coffee crop and giving her children better living conditions in the future.

is 30-year-old young man from the small village of Marneuli district. He lives with his 53-year-old mother, who is housekeeper. He has been involved in the agricultural business from early childhood, as his parents were farmers and this is a traditional activity for the family. \r\n\r\nSadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, Seiran was unable to study for a professional career. He works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing different kinds of vegetables and walnut trees. Harvested vegetables are used in the family and walnuts are sold to local retailers. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Seiran decided to start own business and sought credit among local financial institutions, but his attempt was unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses.

The income is not enough for the family and Mirian decided to start a trading business with the loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Mirian's credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. He received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and the Credo Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of 2400 GEL to begin to trade fruits and vegetables, he will purchase fruits and vegetables at wholesale prices and then resell at higher price to generate income.
