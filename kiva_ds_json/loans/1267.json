","en":"Abdujabbor, age 49, is an experienced carpenter, who manufactures traditional wooden cradles.  In Tajikistan, the Gahvora, a traditional wooden bassinet, is always offered to a newborn child.  Tajik people say that a baby's cradle is his whole world.  The traditional rites surrounding the birth of a child are not even considered complete until the child is offered a Gahvora by his maternal grandparents.  Traditional cradles are readily available on Tajik markets and special attention is always given when purchasing one.  But manufacturing a cradle is not easy.  It is a skill that actually takes years to be mastered.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of wooden bassinets is a tradition in Abdujabbor's family.  Every generation participates.  Abdujabbor's entire family: his wife, his three children as well as his father are involved in this craft.  Having created cradles for decades, the family has its own manufacturing secrets.  It takes two to three young poplars to make one wooden bassinet.  When the wood work is completed, it is then decorated with all the colors of the rainbow.  The cradles manufactured by Abdujabbor and his family sell like hot cakes.  Local market vendors from the town of Qurgan Tube come directly to Abdujabbor's house and buy large quantities of cradles.\r\n\r\nAbdujabbor is currently requesting a loan to increase his production of cradles and thereby expand his activity.  He plans to use his loan to buy some wood, paint and a workbench.\r\n\r\nAbdujabbor currently works from home, but in the future he would like to open his own cradle shop.\r\n

","en":"Davlatbek is a cheerful and a responsible man of 41 years.  He is married and has a child.  He lives with his family in a small hamlet.  However, the house that he lives in is small and is not very comfortable.  Davlatbek's wife is a hardworking homemaker and a caring mother.  Himself, Davlatbek works as a repairman in the town's workshop.  He has been working in this shop for a long time and is well paid.

","en":"Muhabbat, age 53, is a kind and hardworking woman.  She is a \"mother heroine\" [an honorary title which used to be awarded in the Soviet Union for bearing and raising a large family] and the mother of four wonderful daughters and many grandchildren.  All her daughters are now married and living independently.  Muhabbat and her husband live with one grandson, whom they took under their care because they had no son of their own.  Muhabbat comes from a very strong family in which members always support one another.\r\n\r\nThe Tajik people have always been involved in the production of traditional chests.  A young bride's dowry is not complete without a richly decorated chest which, thanks to the craftsmanship of local artisans, fascinates the eye with its incredibly fine details.  Muhabbat and her family come from a long line of such artisans who, generation after generation, have been perpetuating their craft, thus keeping Tajik traditions alive.  While Muhabbat gathers the materials necessary for the production of chests, her husband works at his bench all day, making basic chests.  Later on, it is Muhabbat and her daughters who decorate and paint the chests.\r\n\r\nRecently, Muhabbat's family has also become involved in the production of contemporary chests, which tend to be a better fit for modern interiors.  However, the materials needed for the production of these chests have to be ordered from China and they happen to be more expensive than regular components.  This is the reason why Muhabbat needs money and why she has decided to take a loan with MDO Arvand.  Muhabbat really enjoys the services offered by Arvand.  She is happy and thankful for the support she is receiving!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase materials for the production of chests.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T05:00:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":741.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":764.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":788.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":812.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":837.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":863.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":890.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T12:21:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633785,"name":"El Milagro 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorenza is the group coordinator for El Milagro (The Miracle) 1. This group is located in the city of Hato Mayor. Her home is a compound for her two children. She is taking care of them alone since she is a single mother. The other members run different businesses selling miscellaneous products, clothes, food, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is Lorenza's 15th loan. She sells shoes, clothes and accessories from her home and by walking around her community and others.

Her business experience in the area of clothing dates back to thirteen years ago when, due to the necessity of getting her family ahead, the idea of making clothing dawned to her. Buying a simple machine, she gradually built a customer base, and in addition to this activity, she added another productive business that provided her with an income. That business was the selling of \"bollos,\" or steamed corn buns, mixed with cheese and wrapped in corn husks, for which she bought a grinder and began her production. She still has these two incomes and her customer base is made up of her neighbors who buy her clothing and neighborhood stores that sell her corn buns. Carmen works from Monday to Sunday without a break, and she alone performs all of the work. Currently, she is applying for a loan, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy corn, cheese, salt, and pitas in bulk; she will also buy fabric and thread.

Her determination and hard work enabled her to contribute to her family's livelihood, since what her husband earned was not enough.

She wants her children to achieve great things and to develop in different areas so that they can get on well in society.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":41,"image":{"id":1471161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to open a shop inside her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":47.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":65.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":78.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.43},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.52},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T17:46:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633160,"name":"Neris Misael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Neris es un joven de 26 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedica a la agricultura y cuenta con una experiencia de 11 a\u00f1os.

He is married, has one young child, and lives in a small rural town. He completed training to be a minivan driver, and began to work as a chauffeur. He rented a minivan and began to operate a taxi and delivery service. This has become a stable business that enables Said to earn a solid income. Said\u2019s wife is a housewife; she takes care of their baby. Said and his wife are doing all they can to provide for all of their child\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSince Said does not own his own minivan, he has to spend money leasing a vehicle. He wants to buy his own vehicle; if he wants to expand his business, he can\u2019t afford to pay the expenses of leasing. To buy a minivan, Said needs a large sum of money. So he has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy a minivan. He thanks Arvand in advance for their support, which will result in an improved quality of life for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1467638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

Over time she got married and she and her husband have two children who live with them.  Their oldest son is 6 years old and just finished kindergarten at the local school; their daughter is only one year old.  Together they raise coffee and she learned to work the land when she was a little girl, because her parents were farmers and taught her how to raise coffee.\r\n\r\nHer crops are located 3 km away and they walk there.  She also has two other plots of coffee and they are just now beginning to produce their first harvests.

Zarifa has a pedagogical education. She works in a middle school as a history teacher, but since she receives a small salary and this pay is not enough to support three children, she started her own business growing and selling potatoes and wheat. Her region is very good for growing potatoes, since the earth and climate are suitable for growing this vegetable. Zarifa is helped by her husband in running the business. <br \/><br \/>Zarifa has long been dreaming of repairing her old home, which was left by her husband's parents. She spent all her money on the fall planting. She does not have money to buy building materials to repair her home.

One son is a construction worker, the other son works on a waste collection truck, and her daughter is ill. \r\n\r\nMaria is in the business of making and selling tamales, a craft she has done for 20 years. She learned how to make tamales from her mother who always instilled that creating a business selling tamales was a good choice to remain in business and earn profits. She has no other source of income besides making chicken tamales. Her daughter-in-law helps her to make the tamales but only Maria goes out to sell them to their neighborhood. She wakes at three in the morning to cook the corn and do all of the preparations. When the tamales are all ready, she serves them as breakfast to her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loan she has applied to from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy leaves to wrap the tamales and the ingredients for making them so she can prepare more and go out to sell more tamales. She is going to gain more clients because customers have been asking when she is going to make tamales so they can buy them and because she has experience.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help the household income as the only work done by her husband is in agriculture which is difficult. On occasion, he gets work in construction jobs which is when there is an income. She has to struggle to obtain money to purchase the medicine for her daughter who is sick.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue making tamales until she can no longer stand upright because for her it is fun for her to sell apart from the earning and income she obtains."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":46.91,"image":{"id":1471208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients to make and wrap tamales in order to go out and sell more.

She is 31 years old and married. She and her husband have 2 children: a 3-year-old son and a 1-month-old daughter.\r\n\r\nMaritza Dolores has been growing coffee from an early age, since she worked with her father on a small coffee plantation that he owned. He taught her everything about growing coffee and she took advantage of his expertise. After, with her own effort, she bought 2 'manzanas' of land (a manzana is about 7000 square meters). The land is located in the same area where her home is found and is cultivated with coffee, which today she is harvesting in its entirety.\r\n\r\nHer husband is her key supporter in life and on the fields, since they work together to obtain higher income to improve their economic situation and cover the needs that arise daily. \r\n\r\nMartiza Dolores aims to improve the production of her crops to ensure her children\u2019s future and to buy more property as an inheritance. Also, through her profits, she dreams of supporting her children in their studies since she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to attend high school or college. She hopes her children become professionals. \r\n\r\nTherefore, today Maritza is requesting a loan to buy fertilizer, urea, foliar sprays, etc., since she has 2 'manzanas' of cultivated land and this will help her obtain a good harvest at the end of the coffee-growing season."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1471202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies to tend her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-19T19:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-18T19:40:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T19:50:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634458,"name":"Tabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabu is married with four children who attend school.

She lives with her children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono quarter in the north of Bougouni. She did not attend a modern school, but attended a Koranic school for years. Following her husband's death, and with children in her care, she was obliged to earn a living in order to see to her family's needs. It is for this reason that she began selling various items from her store, a skill she was taught by her late husband. With over 20 years' experience she is now an expert in her field. She learned about Soro Yiriwaso via one of the organisation's representatives, and entered its credit programme. With this new loan she aims to buy 4 bags of sugar, 3 boxes of tea, 3 boxes of cigarettes and packets of sweets. She is on her fifth loan and all the previous loans have been repaid.

Irakli is a very enthusiastic young man and wishes to be financially independent. He decided to start his own business with the help of a loan. Irakli requested a loan from MFO Credo and the application was approved within the startup program framework that enables inexperienced borrowers to begin new businesses. Irakli owns a commercial space, and with the loan received, he will purchase essential equipment, such as a vacuum cleaner, hoses and power washers, for a car wash.

53, lives with her grown daughter-in-law and grandchild in Kutaisi city. The source of income for the family is small-sized money transfers from abroad where Manana\u2019s son works. In order to generate monthly income on her own, Manana decided to start up a grocery store near her house, but she found she didn\u2019t have enough money to do so. Unfortunately, Manana was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions as they required business experience and stable income as a precondition to a loan. \r\n\r\nBut Manana has now received her loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms for the vulnerable and poor who do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of 5,000 USD, Manana will purchase stock of basic groceries to start a store.

She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night.

Everyone works as he is able. <br \/><br \/>Davron himself is engaged in his own business. He is involved in raising animals, and also growing crops. This business brings income to Davron, but the core business is still livestock. In this work, he is helped by his wife. She cares for the livestock, and also sells the milk gathered from them. The livestock business brings Davron a good and stable income. Therefore, he wishes to expand this business. It is necessary for him to buy a few more heads of livestock for raising and future sale. <br \/><br \/>For this, Davron applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy livestock. He hopes that this business will successfully expand and bring more profits, in order to meet the family's needs in a high quality manner.

She is married and is raising her children in the spirit of patriotism.  Six years ago, Dilrabo began her own business buying and selling clothing at a local market. She has her own trade spot at the market. She mainly sells children's clothing, since the demand for children's clothing is greater than that for men's or women's clothing at the local market. <br \/><br \/>She has to renew her goods for the

","en":"Bibirajab, age 48, works as a seamstress and lives in the Fayzabad district, just a few kilometers away from the capital city.  She is married and the mother of four children.  She makes a living offering sewing services, a profession which is in very high demand.  She sews a couple of dresses every day (mostly traditional Tajik dresses for women).  Since she started in this business five years ago, she has acquired some regular customers who are always pleased with her work.\r\n\r\nBibirajab now wants to expand her activity and improve her family's living conditions, which is the reason why she is taking a loan of 3,000 USD.

She has been working as a dispatcher in a Ltd. company for the past five years.  She has three children.  She and her husband own their house.  In addition to her job, she also uses a sewing machine, at home, and she makes some money from sewing.\r\n\r\nTatyana has been dreaming about buying some bedroom furniture for her house, as the old sofa the couple uses in their bedroom is now very worn out.  She needs 5,000 Hryvnia for this purchase and, so far, she has not been able to save the whole amount necessary to buy bedroom furniture.  This is why she has decided to make her dream come true by applying for a loan from Kiva, and gradually pay back her loan amount.   \r\n\r\nIn the future, Tatyana would like to open her own sewing shop and focus more on that type of business, because she is quite good at it.

Kartlos runs a pig farm and sells piglets seasonally. He works hard all day long to earn his living, but his existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses. That is why Kartlos decided to start another business. He applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved under the startup loan program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.
