She lives in Borjomi District with her mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Irina requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and her family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Irina's monthly income. She works as a shop assistant. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo's estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor income category. \r\n\r\nIrina requested a loan from Credo to restart a family business, which had recently been stopped because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages a provision for business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Irina will purchase the shop where she works as an assistant. The current owner decided to sell the shop and move to a new residence. After Irina officially registers the shop, she will continue working there. Owning the shop will increase the income of Irina's family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of Irina's family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1379.17,"image":{"id":1242141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a shop.

que se hallaban, por lo que solo termin\u00f3 sus estudios de la escuela primaria, por lo cual muchos de sus sue\u00f1os se vieron frustrados como por ejemplo el de ser un futbolista profesional. Sin embargo Luis estima que la recompensa de ver a su familia con una vida estable ha compensado el vac\u00edo de esos sue\u00f1os no cumplidos. Luis vive con su madre Cruz de 59 a\u00f1os quien se dedica a quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos en su hogar y tambi\u00e9n con su hermana Susana que es costurera y tiene dos hijos; Dayana y Jhon que se encuentran estudiando. Juntos viven en Quito en el sur de la ciudad.  Hasta hace pocos el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito, no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Chillogallo, en donde reside Luis, es un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nLuis hace 2 a\u00f1os  con la experiencia y consejo de su t\u00eda, decidi\u00f3 establecer un negocio de comercio de frutas, verduras y legumbres a brigadas militares quienes compran al por mayor para abastecer en los cuarteles de formaci\u00f3n militar de la ciudad.

","en":"Luis, 21, is single and pledged to help his family from a very young age because of the difficult situation in which they found themselves.  This is why he only finished elementary school.  As a result, many of his dreams were frustrated, such as being a professional soccer player.  Nevertheless, Luis values that seeing his family with a stable life has repaid the emptiness of his unrealized dreams.\r\n\r\nLuis lives with his mother, Cruz, 59, who devotes herself to the household, and with his sister Susana, who's a seamstress and has two children, Dayana and Jhon, who are students.  Together they live in Quito in the southern part of the city.  Until a few years ago the southern sector of the city of Quito was not considered one of the stronger economic sectors of the capital of the Republic of Ecuador.  Now this area is considered a force in the city's economy.  Here there are enterprising families who have struggled to get ahead.\r\n\r\nBetween the natives and migrants from other cities and countries, it has been a point of encounter of residents of several provinces and is built with wide streets.  Cillogallo, where Luis lives, is an area of high commercial activity that is strengthened more all the time and contributes to the city's economic growth.  This area stands out for its parks with expansive green areas where families go on the weekend.  There's access to all types of services, and the residents are enterprising people who make the most of every opportunity to set up new businesses.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, with his experience and the advice of his aunt, Luis decided to set up a business selling fruits, vegetables, and legumes to military troops who buy in bulk to stock the military barracks in the city.  He devotes seven hours to this job and has the help of his cousin, who also has experience in this work.\r\n\r\nNow Luis wants to buy more assorted products to satisfy customer demand and increase his sales, so he can take up his studies again.  With his experience, he hopes to one day set up a company and also to have the opportunity to demonstrate his abilities as a soccer player.\r\n\r\nTo this end Luis has requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to buy new products.  He sees it as a new opportunity to get ahead.  He also plans to make the most of this loan and the advice they give him as tools for managing his business well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1242366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy assorted fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-11-22T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-22T23:30:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1542.3,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":240.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":252.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":256.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":261.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":267.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.39},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":242.17,"local_amount":240.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":242.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126213,"comment":null},{"amount":253.77,"local_amount":252.51,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":253.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516818,"comment":null},{"amount":257.49,"local_amount":256.21,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":257.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068674,"comment":null},{"amount":262.39,"local_amount":261.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":262.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494940,"comment":null},{"amount":265.09,"local_amount":263.78,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":265.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524869,"comment":null},{"amount":269.09,"local_amount":267.75,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":269.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133174,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T05:07:36Z","paid_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499549,"name":"Maria Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo porque necesita dinero para invertir en este periodo de temporada de mayor demanda, comprando productos de belleza como tintes, cremas, shampoo, tratamientos de belleza.\nElla considera que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayudo a fortalecer el negocio, ya que tuvo m\u00e1s disponibilidad en los productos que ofrece y su condici\u00f3n en la familia se mantiene. \n","en":"Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan because she needs money to invest for this period of high demand.

Her sales point is located in a very busy avenue in the city.  Since starting the business she\u2019s always worked with help from another person.  She started two years ago and has seen that it\u2019s a very profitable activity because it generates good income that helps her cover family expenses.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she also has a first-aid station that she opened four years ago putting into practice the skills she\u2019s acquired in her nursing courses.  What she likes about her activity is that it lets her tend to her family whenever necessary; in addition, all her sales are cash which means no problems are generated.  She hopes to continue working like she\u2019s done to date and gradually furnish her clothing sales locale and acquire new furnishing for her first-aid station.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4 and she\u2019s very grateful for the credit opportunity she\u2019s being granted and for the financial back-up she needs to continue forward.

She lives in the municipality of Soledad with her spouse and has three children whose ages range between 28 and 31.

She has done this job for more than five years and sells mainly to her friends and family members through a system of credit delivery, later making the collection.  She says she works alone because this way her earnings increase.  On the other hand, in the mornings she works as a secretary in a public institution which allows her to also offer her products to her work friends.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is that it allows her to have time with her family, and it is going well because her earnings exceed her initial investment.  Later on she hopes to establish her own store where she offers her products with more comfort in addition to other accessories and feminine garments.  This is her fourth loan with MFP; she thanks those people who have offered her the loan that she needs to increase her working capital and she promises to make her repayments on time.  She is happy to belong to her communal bank because they are mutually supportive and responsible.  With the requested amount of 3000 soles she will buy a large quantity of personal care products like perfumes, colognes, shampoo, talcum powder, and others, in addition to investing in the purchase of shoes, wallets, and other accessories for women with which she hopes to increase her earnings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1242514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfume, cologne, shampoo, talcum powder, shoes and wallets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T01:50:04Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":434.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":482.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":494.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":534.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":552.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":359.42,"local_amount":917.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":933.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188917,"comment":null},{"amount":193.73,"local_amount":494.64,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":503.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572814,"comment":null},{"amount":196.16,"local_amount":500.83,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":509.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122477,"comment":null},{"amount":209.38,"local_amount":534.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":543.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868298,"comment":null},{"amount":216.31,"local_amount":552.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":561.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577117,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-20T07:19:05Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499707,"name":"Chamangul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0427\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0434\u0430\u0442. \u0415\u0439 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0427\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043e\u043c. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0427\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0437. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0427\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430.\n\u0427\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0437.

Irene is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kachwaba in the Fortportal region of Uganda.  She is married and has one child.  For the past year, Irene has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells flour, sugar, soap, and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more commodities like sodas, sugar, splash juice and cooking oil for resale.  The loan will help Irene to generate greater profits and pay for her families medical bills.  Irene hopes that in the future she will be able to go back to school since she didn\u2019t get a chance to complete her studies. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

Nowadays, he is the president of the group and the only male. They have participated together many years. Italo sells bread, a trade which he carries out every day in the mornings, distributing homemade bread to different areas of the city. With his savings, he has managed to open another business selling butane for household use. For this reason, he bought a stand in the market in his area from which he makes his sales and distribution of the butane.. His customers are the same market traders, housekeepers, and local restaurants.

She is kind and hardworking. She has been single for many years, but she has 4 children who she raised alone and with much strength. She lives in her own house with her youngest daughter of 15 years, since the others are independents. However, they always offer the necessary support to afford the household expenses. The primary occupation of our friend Rosa consists in the sale of groceries such as rice, sugar, milk, eggs, oils, and some regional products such as plantains and vegetables. She has a small shop which she has established in her house, and from there is open every day from early on. All that she offers to the public she renews daily, purchasing wholesale in the city marketplace. She selects the freshest and healthiest vegetables.  She works alone the majority of the time, but occasionally her daughter helps her when she has to do some errands outside of home. She has done this work for about a year and she likes the convenience and ease with which she is able to generate income in her own home.\r\n\r\nShe really likes what she does because the dividends that she obtains from the sale of her products, she is able to afford the academic expenses of her daughter and can also cover the basic necessities of her household. Later, she hopes to expand her small shop so that she is able to offer more items and her earnings will grow. This is her 4th loan with MFP.

The main dish that she offers her customers is \"chicken soup\" She has a stand in a busy street in the city that is adjacent to the fishing port and other public entities,  which permits her to have a great number of customers that go in search of the delicious and hearty soups, as only she knows how to prepare. She has done this work more than 2 years and it is going very well. Moreover, she has a mototaxi which she bought with the help of her spouse, and that generates an additional economic income. She really likes what she does since it allows her to have time available in the evenings and to be quiet in her house with her children.

\u201cGo Befo\u201d group. These are small-scale entrepreneurs, who have come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to seek a loan of 800,000 Leones (for each person) in order to invest in their businesses. This is the third loan that this group of entrepreneurs are accessing from Kiva lenders through SMT. With the help of the previous Kiva lenders' loan, they were able to increase their business inventories, make better profits and improve their living conditions. Having completed repayment of their last loan successfully, two members out of the five in the group would like to get a new loan, in order to further improve their businesses.  \r\n\r\nKadiatu is the featured leader of this group. Kadiatu is 40 years old. She is married and has five children, who are attending secondary schools. Kadiatu sells cooked rice with delicious sauce, and has been a businesswoman for 10 years now. With the help of this loan, she will invest in her business by buying cooking ingredients, like uncooked rice, palm-oil (the country's most popular cooking oil), tomatoes, onions, and ground nuts, in bulk. With these bulk items at hand, she will stop buying them at retail prices and will be able to cook a larger quantity of rice and sauce for sale.

She first set up her hairdressing salon in her own home but she now has another salon in the city center.  Her work is very demanding as she also has to raise and educate her children.  She says that her work is very tiring but also gratifying.  She also says that there is a lot of competition in her business and often disloyalty.  Ninfa is growing her business and also sells ladies' clothing and underwear so that she can further meet the needs of her customers.\r\n\r\nNinfa is requesting this loan to buy blouses, pants and shirts so that she can expand in this new field.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rhodora is requesting a Php12,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. <p>\r\n\r\nRhodora hopes to further expand, and dreams of giving her children a good quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLoreta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Loreta's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Loreta is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLoreta hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nZarah operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Zarah's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Zarah is requesting a 40,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nZarah hopes to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance

She needs merchandise for her business and she purchases it from different locales where they offer different styles, sizes and also underwear at low costs, or at least reasonable prices. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help her purchase clothing and a tricycle. \r\n\r\nOne of the goals that Ruth has is to be able to purchase a truck that she can use to sell her clothing more comfortably because she can no longer continue as she has due to her hip that is very delicate and she will also be able to purchase clothing more easily and carry it in her truck. \r\n\r\nRuth lives with one child who works. Her dream is to adapt a space in her home to locate her business and not have to work anymore on market days. \r\nShe is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her since it has allowed her to invest in her business.  She also feels very comfortable with the company and the other members of her bank. They all have different activities and interests, which serves as a moment of distraction for her. She respects the training that is shared at the meetings and has learned how to administer her business in a better way. \r\n\r\nLa Florida is a community located in the Southeast of Santiago, capital of Chile.

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  In Patan, the Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or carved in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing their profit

","en":"Carmen Elena, who is 62 years old, lives in the town of Soledad with her husband. They have two daughters, ages 43 and 29. She located a store in a space in her home. There she sells products for daily use, in small quantities, to the families of her community, in accordance with her capacity to make purchases. Her business initiative began in the year 1999, even though she had experience in stores since 1972. For this reason she began little by little, but with firm steps. First she bought a refrigerator, then she added rice, oil, sugar, and finally meat, dairy products, and soft drinks. Now her business is going well for her. Every day she sells from 5 in the morning until 9 at night, sometimes for cash and sometimes on credit, since she has a customer base whom she knows, and she finances their daily purchases, because they pay her weekly. Her customers are from the neighborhood where she lives and its surroundings, since they know that in her store they will find everything they need. Recently her customers have increased, and her working capital has become insufficient to meet their demand, because the turnover is very rapid and she constantly needs to be placing orders, which gets her behind in her sales tasks. This is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy milk products and sausages, in addition to a display case to improve the appearance of her business premises. With a Kiva loan, she will make this investment and will succeed in improving her stock and increasing her daily sales, because they grow during the Christmas and New Year's seasons, making the investment of a loan very effective."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1243039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy dairy products, sausages, and also a display case.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-23T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-23T17:50:06Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":183333},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":183333},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":183333},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183333},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183333},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":183333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":189241.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519745,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":183333,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":189241.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071584,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":183333,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":189241.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497800,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":183333,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":189241.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527608,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":366668,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":378484.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928366,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-03T19:27:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490189,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is 33 years old and a business man.

Three years ago she started a small grocery store where she sells vegetables, fruit, snacks, soft-drinks, candy, basic grains, bags of water, bread, condiments and others.\r\n\r\nSara has decided to ask ODEF for a 4,500 Lempira loan to buy more products like soft-drinks, bread, snacks, vegetables and basic grains.  This loan will help her keep her business active to increase sales.  Sara wants to continue working hard in order to save up for her old-age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1243015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

","en":"Indira is 33 years old, married, and has three children. According to the mother, the elder son is studying in the fifth class. He is very serious and clever. Her daughter and second son will soon go to school, but they are not like their brother and they love to play around and make noise. \r\n\r\nAs income for the family, Indira engages in the food trade. Thanks to her hard work, Indira's activities can bring in about 20,000 som per month, which covers the basic costs of food and household needs for the family. Given the special friendliness of the shop owner and a good assortment of products, Indira has many customers visiting her store, which requires the participation of her whole family in the business. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the store, Indira also has a public bath which in turn generates an additional 10,000 KGS per month. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Indira appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 90,000 som (KGS) to increase her inventory at the store and the expansion of the bath. Indira will use income from the loan to invest in a further increase in her business and in the long term to build a big house for her family and a barn for

Sus ventas las realiza  de contado, trabajando durante todos los d\u00edas de la semana y sus clientes son principalmente tenderos y habitantes del barrio donde habita. Aumentar las ventas en esta temporada de fiestas que se acerca, a finales del a\u00f1o, se ha convertido en todo un desaf\u00edo, porque su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para aumentar el inventario y con ello generar m\u00e1s utilidades, aprovechando la \u00e9poca. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 productos de aseo personal, como cremas dentales,  e insumos, para prepara sancochos y derivados de la harina de trigo, como arepas empanadas etc. Con esta inversi\u00f3n planea aumentar sus ventas y generar mayores utilidades, que las que usualmente obtiene en cualquier otra \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, pues su mercado son las tiendas y trabajadores y pacientes del hospital cercano, adem\u00e1s de sus vecinos del barrio que les gusta los productos que Gregoria  vende y le compran permanentemente.     ","en":"Gregoria, 48, lives in the south of the city with her partner and her 20-year-old daughter. She hopes to see her daughter become a successful professional and this is what pushed her forward in her day to day life. Gregoria earns money for her household through a business in which she prepares and sells natural juices, soft drinks, candy, and fried foods. She also sells a variety of merchandise, like personal hygiene products, soaps, creams, disposable products, towels, tablecloths, etc. She sells for cash, working every day of the week. Her customers are mainly shopkeepers and residents of the neighborhood where she lives. Increasing her sales in the upcoming holiday season at the end of the year is proving to be a challenge. She doesn't have enough working capital to increase her inventory and earn more income, taking advantage of the season.\r\n\r\nThis is why she is resorting to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy personal hygiene products, like toothpaste, and ingredients to make sancochos (a traditional stew) and foods made with wheat flour, like arepas and empanadas, etc. With this investment, she plans to expend her sales and make more money than she usually makes at other times during the year. Her markets are the stores, workers, and patients in a nearby hospital. This is in addition to her neighbors, who like the products that Gregoria sells and buy them consistently.

Fatima's husband died suddenly. They started their own business together, but after his death she was left alone with the children with all of life's problems. The local administration paid benefits for a single mother of 3,500 KGS. \r\n\r\nDespite all the problems, she remains cheerful and upbeat. She firmly believes in the bright future of her family. \r\n\r\nAs the main source of the family's income, Fatima engages in raising livestock. Begun ten years ago, she and her husband bought a cow for 8,000 som (KGS) and today on her homestead she has two dairy cows and a horse. Her monthly income from the homestead is about 6,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of developing her business, Fatima appealed to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy one cow and five sheep.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional merchandise, like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments, and other products her customers have ordered. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMinerva hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams that her youngest child will finish college.

es una mujer de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, que vive en la ciudad de Barranquilla, ella es madre comunitaria, es decir forma parte de un programa del gobierno colombiano, en el cual asignan ni\u00f1os en la primera infancia para que en su vivienda sean cuidados y alimentados mientras sus padres, que son sus vecinos trabajan. Astrid en esta actividad comunitaria, ha logrado conocer a muchas personas y se han convertido en sus principales clientes de su negocio, de venta de productos de tocador que distribuye a cr\u00e9dito. Este negocio lo aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, hace mas de 14 a\u00f1os, pues ella se dedicaba a la venta de mercanc\u00eda variada y la ense\u00f1\u00f3 a seleccionar a sus compradores de productos a cr\u00e9ditos, a recuperar las cuentas por cobrar y tambi\u00e9n sus padres le dieron un capital para que trabajara. As\u00ed fue como empez\u00f3,  y hoy es un negocio que le ofrece ingresos con los que apoya el sustento e su hogar, conformado por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 3 hijos en las edades de 6 a 15 a\u00f1os. Su meta es multiplicar sus ventas y esta es uno de sus mayores desaf\u00edos, porque no cuenta con el suficiente capital de trabajo, para r\u00e1pidamente incrementarlas, especialmente en la \u00e9poca de fin de a\u00f1o, en la cual todo lo que ofrece lo vende. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 talcos, colonias, shampoo, cremas y productos capilares, pues su prop\u00f3sito  m\u00e1s importante,  es lograr ampliar su mercado y esto es justamente lo que gradualmente lograr\u00e1, con cr\u00e9ditos bien aplicados a su negocio.

She\u2019s a communal mother, that is, she participates in a program of the Colombian government by which pre-school age children are assigned to her and to her home so that she can care for them and feed them while their parents who are her neighbors work.  \r\n\r\nBy means of this community work, Astrid has met many people who have become her main customers in her business selling beauty products on credit.  She learned this business from her mother more than 14 years ago since she worked selling assorted merchandise and taught her how to choose her beauty products credit customers, how to collect her accounts receivable and her parents also gave her initial capital to work with.

vida y la de su c\u00f3nyuge. Su experiencia data desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, porque su madre   tenia este taller , desde hace 18 a\u00f1os, por lo cual ella y sus hermanas desde su ni\u00f1ez permanec\u00edan entre telas y m\u00e1quinas de coser y se involucraron en este arte;  hasta el d\u00eda de hoy Marcela es la que mas se interes\u00f3 en convertir sus capacidades productivas de su taller,  en un generador de ingresos, para generar bienestar a su hogar. Ella presta el servicio de confecci\u00f3n de ropa femenina, masculina, a una clientela que ha construido poco a poco, entre vecinos, empleados de empresas, familiares y referidos y el de maquila, a empresas importantes,  adicionando con \u00e9ste \u00faltimo otros ingresos,  trabajados unida a su madre quien la asesora aun y a su esposo para que el trabajo com\u00fan sea m\u00e1s efectivo.

","en":"Marcela, who is 28, makes clothing in a little workshop in her home, where she lives with her husband and their two children, ages 2 and 5, the driving force for her life and that of her husband. Her experience dates from 10 years ago, because her mother had such a workshop for 18 years, and so she and her sisters lived among fabric and sewing machines and became involved in this art since their childhood. To this day, Marcela is the one who became most interested in converting her productive training in her mother's workshop into a generator of income, to create well-being in her household. She provides a service of making clothing for women and men for a customer base she has built little by little among neighbors, business employees, relatives, people referred to her, and assembly work for important businesses, which adds another source of income, as well as work she does with her mother, who still advises her and her husband so that the common work will be more effective.

With the goal of receiving an education in economics, Umeda entered the Tadzikistan Technological University in 2008 with a major in World Economy. She is a fifth year student and is a very active participant in university life. She is an excellent student, and her classmates like her very much and value her friendship, for she is a good friend. She has lots of future plans and is trying to make these plans a reality. She wants to work in international organizations, since she is studying international economics. To realize these plans, she must graduate from the university and receive her degree, but her parents cannot afford to pay for her studies. Umeda's father works for an organization and is the family's only source of income; her mother is a housewife and earns no income. Umeda is applying for a loan of 600 US dollars to pay for her tuition. She is relying and depending solely on you.

She is married and raising two children. Her family lives under some very difficult economic and psychological conditions.  Her husband left for the Russian Federation to find employment as a migrant worker but he is not sending any money to help provide for the children.  She therefore tries to support the family by herself, without counting on any help from her husband.  She, alone, buys food, clothes for herself and the children, wood and coal for the winter.  She, alone, also has to pay for the children's school fees and to cover other expenses which require a lot of money.  She doesn't receive any money from her parents either, because their small income does not allow them to help.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at her options, Aydibegim has decided to focus on setting up her own business.  To this end, she enrolled in a course entitled \"Achieving Success\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and from which she has earned a certificate.  She can now start her business for good and become a successful entrepreneur.  She wants to get involved in animal husbandry, because she has experience in this field.  She will use her earnings to give her children a good education and to ensure that they eat a high-calorie diet.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni to buy livestock to start her new business.  Aydibegim and her daughter are awaiting your kindness.

Her profits are used for rent, feeling, school fees, and to improve her savings account.

He joined the group because he believes women are trustworthy and hard-working, so he thought would take a page from their book and improve his livelihood and that of his family. Alex repairs shoes in the outskirts of his city, near a market. He started repairing shoes after realising there were no such services in the area, and yet the shoes bought by the low income earners in that area are not durable and therefore need constant repair. With the income from his repairs, Alex has been able to send two of his children to school. With the loan, he will buy a batch of old shoes, shoe polish and thread to increase his daily income. His dream is to change his business by buying a motorcycle; then if he accumulates enough profits, the motorcycle would help him to buy a plot of land and later build a house for his family.

lives in the Mariakani area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is married. She owns a poultry farm \u2013 a business which she has been operating for two years. She employs two other people in this business. Her main challenge is the threat of poultry diseases, which can kill a whole batch, and the high cost of feeds. \r\n\r\nJosphine learnt about Milango from an employee who invited her to the group.

They have 3 children for whom they care, protect and hope to be able to offer a good education.  Walter grows and harvests palm oil.  He plows and fertilizes the land.  He tells us that when his plants are in the process of growing, it's necessary to irrigate them continuously because of the heat in the city.  He also has to protect them from pests that attack this species of palm.  He does his work 50 kilometers from the city in a community known as \"Neshuya.\"  Here he has 12 hectares of land, which he is cultivating and plowing for planting.\r\n\r\nHe started this business because the majority of people who live in this community do this work.  The government makes it easy to obtain seeds for this plant.  He does this work with his wife and two workers that he hires to plant, care for, and harvest his plants.  Before he started this business, he had problems generating economic income and couldn't support his family because he didn't have a steady job.  This is why he decided to start his own business to generate his own income.  He hopes in the future to increase his production and to increase his economic earnings.  This will be his fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He wants to keep making his payments on time.  He also knows that the group is made up of friendly and respectful people.

She lives in her own home together with her second husband who works in a sawmill and is also her business partner. She is raising two children for whom she hopes to provide a good education and quality of life. Lizbeth works selling baked goods such as orange biscuits, loaves of bread, manjar (a traditional dessert dish similar to pudding), marmalade, etc. She purchases these products from a well-known distributor called Productos Union. She works selling these products door to door, selling them to relatives, neighbors, and others. She got started in this line of work at her mother's suggestion that it was profitable, provided a flexible work schedule, and would allow her to be with her children. Her husband helps her distribute her goods, giving her a ride to the areas where her products are in demand. She notes that her business is indeed profitable because if she manages to sell all her merchandise she earns 50%. For this reason she works hard to get rid of all her goods. She describes how before she got into this line of work she had had a desire to help her husband with the daily expenses, but she was not able to because she didn't have a job. She is thankful for her mother who helped her get started in this work which allows her to earn income. She hopes to build her customer base in the future and to purchase her own vehicle for work. This will be her second loan with MFP. She enjoys working with this group because, despite being new, the people are kind to her and they assist her when she is in need. She is grateful for MFP for the financial support that it provides. The money requested will be used to purchase greater quantities of product such as orange biscuits, loaves of bread, manjar, marmalade, and other items. Because she will be able to purchase in bulk at a lower price, the income she earns will increase. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1243221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase orange biscuits, loaves of bread, and marmalade.
