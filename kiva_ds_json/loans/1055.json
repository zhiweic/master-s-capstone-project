She is divorced and has 2 children, ages 10 and 3. They live together in her house. Isabel's work consists in selling meals on weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, she heads out along the path to prepare her grille, seasons her chicken, and begins to grille it, awaiting her customers. Then, Monday through Friday, she works at a soda fountain. She has kept up this rhythm of work for more than 5 years, having added the grilled chicken sales some months ago. At the outset, this proved a little complicated for Isabel, but with the passage of time, she came to master the rhythm and, now, she has no fear of going out to sell.\r\n \r\nIsabel enjoys her work very much. She has time for her children and, besides, has a good income, since, as noted, she has 2 activities, thus doubling her income. Isabel has lots of plans in mind; she would like to have her own business, but for now, she just wishes to install a soda fountain and thus, no longer depend on anyone else to generate her income. For the moment, she has decided to raise chickens, so she won't have to buy them somewhere else.  This would be more convenient. That's why Isabel is soliciting her 1st loan through MFP, and she hope the collaboration will continue in the future as she works towards her objectives.\r\n\r\nWith the borrowed 800 sols, Isabel will purchase chicks to raise in her house, plus buy the necessary feed and other inputs, enabling her to continue raising chickens.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1291429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens to raise plus the necessary supplies, including chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-02-11T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-13T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125.21},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":130.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":136.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.25,"local_amount":116.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":121.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868908,"comment":null},{"amount":50.86,"local_amount":125.21,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":131.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577749,"comment":null},{"amount":53.16,"local_amount":130.84,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":137.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529980,"comment":null},{"amount":55.28,"local_amount":136.08,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":142.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975010,"comment":null},{"amount":58.03,"local_amount":142.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":149.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996274,"comment":null},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":148.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":155.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863800,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T11:08:48Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526381,"name":"Good Family Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone is very pleased to present the members of the \u201cGood Family\u201d group.

She lives with her husband Antonio and together they have two children, Stefany and Jos\u00e9. Julia looks after the children at home.\nTogether with her husband, Julia started investing time and effort in farming some land her husband inherited. They plant maize, squash and potatoes and show great dedication in tending to their crops. At planting time they work as hard as they can because they know their efforts will be rewarded - the higher the quality of their produce, the higher their earnings will be. Julia also raises livestock including cattle, pigs and sheep, which she fattens up to sell to the butchers who visit frequently.

Although she now lives in the Ban Boonyuen Village with many of her fellow Mlabri, she spent years without stability.

The gentle Mlabri once lived a peaceful lifestyle as migrant hunter & gatherers, but the teak deforestation and guerrilla warfare of the late 20th century destroyed their lifestyle forever. Impoverished, enslaved and malnourished, the tribe lost most of its members to malaria and other illnesses- with just 300 members left in the world, the Mlabri are listed on UNESCO\u2019s \u201cendangered languages\u201d list. \n\nHammock weaving is the first proven path for Anong and her fellow Mlabri artisans to break free of the cycle of debt and servitude. Although she is a skilled artisan weaver, she has often been pulled back into the fields when there were not enough hammock orders. Raising three children while moving from place to place in the slash & burn fields has been daunting, and she is very excited to use this loan to create a more stable life for her children and begin to save for the future. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1292292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"invest in raw materials to ensure steady income and create a more stable life for her family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TH","country":"Thailand","town":"Rongkwang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 100","type":"point"}},"partner_id":274,"posted_date":"2013-02-11T22:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-13T22:20:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"THB","disbursal_amount":37063,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37063}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":37063,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T22:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":37248.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420005350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T03:27:31Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T22:43:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526395,"name":"Naburereya A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a member of a group of 12 farmers located in Bungoma South District.

Even as a child, her hands were needed in the fields to ensure that the family escaped malnourishment. \n\nAs a member of the Mlabri, Eet has faced an uphill battle for her entire life. The Mlabri and other hill tribes had been denied citizenship, making it extremely difficult to obtain schooling, healthcare, and even basic civil rights. Because the Mlabri only recently transitioned from their reclusive past as hunter & gatherers, they have been taken advantage of by stronger, more modern neighboring tribes. Eet and many of her fellow Mlabri were forced to work in slash & burn agriculture as indentured servants without hope of escape from a life of back-breaking field labor. \n\nDespite this tragic history, weaving hammocks has created a new path for Eet- she and her fellow weavers are some of the first Mlabri to escape the cycle of false debt and begin to build a brighter future for their children.

Teak logging, guerrilla warfare and industrial development robbed them of their forest home and led the Mlabri through a sustained period of deprivation\u2014they were forced into indentured servitude for neighboring tribes and many Mlabri died of malnourishment, malaria and contact with poisonous pesticides used in slash & burn farming. With fewer than 300 Mlabri left in the world, their future was uncertain. \n\nOver the past decade, hammock weaving has helped engineer a turnaround for the Mlabri in the Ban Boonyuen Village, where Mai and her husand live. For a hard worker like Mai, there are new opportunities that were unheard of for the previous generation. As a hammock weaver, she could earn as much as a college-educated teacher in her province. Her husband dreams of planting their own rice crops near the village. Together, they are trying to find ways to improve their lives without taking on debt from unethical middlemen who will trap them in an endless repayment cycle.

People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. They always use yoghurt as a sauce. Milk products are consider very healthy and are a popular part of their diet. \n\nThis represents the only financial income for his family and to makes savings for his future family when he will decide to get marry.

He is the father of 9 children, all now independent adults. He works in his store which he started with his own money, initially by selling various goods from a cart in different neighborhoods in the capital. After some time he had the idea of establishing a store in his home, in order to support his wife and avoid having to go out to the streets to make his sales. He is very pleased that this business is now earning him money every day, as he has many regular clients. He receives help from his wife who manages the shop while he goes out to sell his goods on occasion in one of the city's main Markets, which is a very commercial zone good for business. He hopes to continue growing his business, and at this time is asking for a loan to buy fans, irons, blenders and basic ingredients such as rice, beans, and sugar.

to provide quality products at reasonable prices, Man opened his own herbal retail store in Chinatown in New York City in 2011. His passion and experience, gained while living in Hong Kong before moving to the U.S. 17 years ago, allowed him to supply his local New York community with high-quality, healthful supplements. \r\n\r\nJust a year after he opened his store, however, Hurricane Sandy swept through New York, causing Man's store to lose both electrical power and clients. The storm plunged the store into a blackout for six days, and without electricity, Man lost much of his inventory supply. \r\n\r\nIn an effort to make a comeback from the storm, Man began advertising his business through the local newspaper and radio. With this added financial burden, Man has had to reduce his staff to a single part-time employee, taking on the extra hours himself. \r\n\r\nThis loan would allow Man to once again restock the inventory lost during the storm, help him recover costs for rent and once again hire a full-time employee. Man hopes to use the remainder of the loan to market his supplement store through printed and radio advertisements to bring in more

up in Korea as the daughter of a single mother, Jinny always dreamed of owning her own business.  As a young girl, she watched and learned from her entrepreneurial mother, whose curtain business inspired Jinny to one day start her own business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Jinny traveled across the world alone to pursue schooling in the US.  After earning her degree, she started working in sushi restaurants to learn more about the industry.  As she gained more work experience and knowledge about sushi, she took note of how she wanted to serve sushi differently: with more care, creativity and much more engagement with customers.  \r\n\r\nWith over 10 years of sushi experience under her belt, Jinny and her husband used their savings to open Sushi Kuchi in July 2012.  The mission of Sushi Kuchi is to create superb, fresh and creative sushi, while creating a welcoming and engaging environment for customers.  What sets Sushi Kuchi apart is Jinny\u2019s joyful and positive attitude.  She always takes the time to speak with her customers and loves welcoming them by name. In less than a year since opening, Sushi Kuchi employs ten people and has become a favorite sushi spot in Pacific Beach, San Diego.   \r\n\r\nJinny is seeking a Kiva loan to help keep her restaurant open during the slow winter months. Having only been open since last July, the restaurant did not have enough time to adequately prepare for this winter.  A $10,000 Kiva loan will enable Jinny to keep her doors open, while allowing her to build a patio and a more attractive storefront, setting Sushi Kuchi apart from the crowd.  This new patio will also allow customers to bring their dogs, making Sushi Kuchi a pet-friendly place."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2670.05,"image":{"id":1292684,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2839,"youtubeId":"2qIuOrA2kmE","title":"Kiva

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php16,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nLilia hopes that her store will grow and that she will have more loyal customers. She dreams to give her children a good education and a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1292744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":6400.02,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6520.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347037319,"comment":null},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4266.98,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4346.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781836,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4345.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488726,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1087,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-12T15:20:49Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526554,"name":"Perla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perla is married with 2 children.

She has been in this field for more than 30 years. Adding to her income from the rice paddy, another main income has been created by her husband providing transportation service with his motorcycle linked with a trailer, which can be loaded with around 20 passengers for a one-way trip from their doorsteps to a local market, or back from the market to their houses. He is able to generate approximately 10.00 USD per day. \r\n\r\nFrom their house in a small village of the Prey Chor district, Chier\u2019s husband wants to provide motorbike repair service as his supplementary business for extra income. However, he doesn\u2019t have enough capital to buy repair tools to make this business possible. That\u2019s why his wife, Chier, is seeking financial assistance through HKL and Kiva to buy tools for their repair shop.

Her previous loan was a big help in her store, for she was able to buy more products needed in her business. Her business has been running for 11 years now, and it keeps on growing. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a new 20,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her current inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJulita dreams to have her own stall and hopes to become rich. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

","en":"Abdulla is fifty-eight and divorced.  His primary source of income is selling fruits and vegetables at the local farmers market.  Having begun ten years ago with starting capital of 5000KGS, Abdulla now has a very stable and profitable business with a steady client base, earning around 15,000KGS per month.

He lives with his wife and children in a large traditional family in Kamalen Sirakoro, a rural commune of Sikasso (third-largest administrative region in the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nBandjougou Youssouf began working in the storage and sale of grains (corn, millet, sorghum) seven years ago, after having worked in many other areas without success. He has a store in Kabo\u00efla I.\r\n\r\nHe decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in the hope of better satisfying his growing customer base. He is on his second individual loan. The previous loan was correctly repaid.\r\n\r\nHe plans to use this second loan to buy 30 bags of corn and 30 bags of millet from the surrounding towns of Sikasso. The goods are first stocked in his store, then resold to a clientele made up of retailers and heads of families.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to earn a monthly profit of 150,000 FCFA, which he will use mainly to support his family and pay the interest of his loan.

She is raising 2 sons who actively help her on the farm. She has a high school education. After graduating, she worked helping her parents before getting married. Her husband passed away suddenly. Aigul is a very kind, calm, and determined woman. Thanks to her efforts and her hard work, her business is developing very well. She fattens and sells cattle, and she also sells milk. Having started this business in 1986 with a sum of only 4,000 Kyrgyzstan Som, she now has 1 cow, 1 calf, 1 horse and 11 head of livestock. Her monthly income from selling cattle and milk is 9,000 Som. Aigul has now approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 45,000 Som to purchase 2 bulls. In the future, she plans to renovate her house and improve her family's standard of living.

","en":"Qizlaroy lives in the Khuroson region. She is 43 years old, married, and has 3 children. Her husband and sons are currently abroad, earning a living as migrant workers. Qizlaroy herself works in animal husbandry. She buys both large and small livestock, fattens them, and sells them at the market for a profit. She has been doing this kind of work for 6 years. Now that she has a wealth of experience in this field, she wants to increase her herd. For this reason, Qizlaroy is seeking a loan so that she can purchase more livestock to fatten and sell. She plans to use the profit to further expand her business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":867.42,"image":{"id":1292877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khuroson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qizlaroy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":350.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":361.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":372.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":383.9},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":395.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":408.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":420.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":433.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":447.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":461.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":475.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":490.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.31,"local_amount":350.3,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:59:51Z","rounded_local_amount":358.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355876016,"comment":null},{"amount":157.81,"local_amount":734,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":750.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364586128,"comment":null},{"amount":82.46,"local_amount":383.6,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":392.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381765624,"comment":null},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":395.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":404.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390628658,"comment":null},{"amount":87.75,"local_amount":408.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":417.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399872857,"comment":null},{"amount":90.64,"local_amount":421.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":431.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410149585,"comment":null},{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":433.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":443.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419912752,"comment":null},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":446.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":457,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429560883,"comment":null},{"amount":99.14,"local_amount":460.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":471.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440029801,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-18T16:49:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526588,"name":"Fuarosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fuarosa, age 37, sells German-style buns in her community to earn a living.

Therefore, it is difficult for her to buy it in order to keep her crop and her nursery healthy.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to be able to get better income in order to continue supporting her dream and her children's dream.  The dream is to see her children going to school every day.  Her dream is to see them, in the future, graduate with careers that would allow them to have better job opportunities and a better lifestyle.  This is because working with the land is very difficult and the profits are small.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":51.67,"image":{"id":1291563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizers and irrigation pumps for her corn and bean crops and her coffee nursery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Lepaera, Lempira","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-02-12T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-14T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.67,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042158,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-13T00:42:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526945,"name":"Maria Nicolasa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria Nicolasa esta casada, tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, tiene 6 hijos quienes est\u00e1n estudiando, se dedica a la tejedur\u00eda de cortes t\u00edpicos, inicio este trabajo gracias al apoyo de su pap\u00e1 que la llevo a un negocio para que trabajara y aprendiera este trabajo, hasta el momento lleva 6 a\u00f1os de experiencia, cuentan con el apoyo de su esposo quien realiza el mismo trabajo.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que le servir\u00e1 para la compra de materiales, espec\u00edficamente la compra de hilos de diferentes colores y clases, espera seguir mejorando su producci\u00f3n y estar con los dise\u00f1os actuales.

Randa is therefore seeking a $1,500 loan from FATEN, which will help Randa's husband improve his business and hopefully make the business more profitable.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":545.58,"image":{"id":1289268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle

Orozgul's children are adults, but her two single daughters live with their parents.  In 1995, Orozgul began working in animal husbandry and started the business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to Orozgul's hard work, her farm is now highly developed and brings in about 10,000 KGS per month.

Sodikboy's wife does not work anywhere, as she does not have high school education. She is engaged in raising the children. It is very tough for Sodikboy, as he is the only provider for the family.\r\n\r\nSodikboy works in his own studio, repairing fridges, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners and other electronic devices. He has a large number of clients in his village. Sodikboy's studio is in a very poor state, and is in need of repair.

a coffee farmer aged 35 years, is married with four children. He started farming way back after dropping out of school. He did so many jobs but failed due to his education level. This could not lead him to a moderate life standard. \r\n\r\nHe then decided to concentrate on coffee farming which has given him a new life. As of today, Charles has managed to build a home for his family, and he can raise school fees for the children and take care of their medical bills.

Gedeon joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer; it makes the community come together.\r\n\r\nGedeon reports that before working with One Acre Fund, he was able to grow about 1.5 bags of maize per 1\/4 acre, but with his One Acre Fund loan during long rains 2012, he harvested 4 bags per 1\/4 acre! \r\n\r\nHe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, and perhaps to invest in another business. \r\n\r\nGedeon\u2019s group members will each receive loans for a  \u00bd acre of production during the 2013 long rains season. In total, they will receive loans for 7.5 acres of maize, millet, and sorghum.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1292286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the cultivation of maize, millet and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"kakamega south","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-02-13T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-15T01:00:04Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gedeon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harrison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obadia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Torokasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vihenda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":82500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":82500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83267.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429602660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T08:21:06Z","paid_date":"2014-01-03T10:22:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":526673,"name":"Purification","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purification is 59 years old, married with five children.

is a 58-year-old resident of Payatas, Philippines. She is a widow and mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business together with her children. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNimfa operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones to much larger doormats, as well as other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding down the highway in a speeding jeepney. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNimfa dreams that her business will grow even more and hopes to have a happy and good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week, where she can share stories of her work and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1292935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To pay for

","en":"Abdukudus is a 46-year-old man, who lives in a village. He is married with five children, three of which are not yet school-aged. He has young children because he married late. Abdukudus's wife is not currently working because she is raising the children. In her time away from child-rearing, she helps her husband to care for and feed their cattle. \r\n\r\nAbdukudus has raised cattle for 15 years now. He also earns a living working as a guard at the collective farm. It is very difficult for him to support his family financially because he is the family's only source of income. His entire income from his job as a guard is needed simply for survival. His main income comes from raising and feeding cattle. Hence, he is trying to develop this business.

is a 25-year-old, married man from Gaza city. He lives in a small house, with his wife and a little male son. Wajeeh has owned a men's clothing store, since five years ago. It is a very successful store, because of the good-quality products and its location in a good commercial area in Gaza. But this store needs some support to increase the quantity of the inventory.\r\n \r\nWajeeh took a US Dollar, Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Wajeeh to purchase a new collection of clothes, which will increase the stock in the clothing store so the revenue will increase. Wajeeh had his picture taken in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context, by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
