support his family, Jose entered the janitorial business more than 17 years ago, cleaning facilities as a side job. Born and raised in Carrollton, Texas, just northwest of Dallas, Jose is familiar with the hustle and bustle of city life and excited about officially working as owner of his self-titled cleaning business.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the radio one day, he learned about Accion Texas Inc. and all the organization can do to help him start his own business.  He quickly inquired about applying for a loan, and after he submitted his application, was approved for a loan.

Su proceso productivo inicia con la compra de telas e insumos como botones e hilos, hace los dise\u00f1os, los corta, confecciona, empaca, y los coloca en el punto de venta. La venta es diaria y de contado. Compra tambi\u00e9n de contado en almacenes de telas y de insumos de confecciones.  Diana ha recibido dos cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; su primer credikiva lo usar\u00e1 para la compra de telas, hilos, botones, gorros, guantes, bufandas, una m\u00e1quina plana y una cortadora. Con esta inversi\u00f3n espera aumentar su producci\u00f3n y sus ventas, para m\u00e1s adelante ver cumplir sus sue\u00f1os de crecimiento del negocio con dos puntos de venta.  ","en":"Diana, 38, has a sewing business and sells pijamas, hats, scarves and gloves.  She lives in the beautiful capital city of Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, with her husband and 13-year-old son.  For four years she has been making pijamas in response to the demand by customers who, when visiting her business, would ask if she sold pijamas.  Diana saw an opportunity to expand business, increase her income and contribute more to the household economy in an effort to improve the family's lifestyle.\r\n\r\nHer manufacturing process begins with the purchase of fabric and supplies such as buttons and thread; then she designs, cuts, sews, packages and puts her products up for sale.  She sells every day on cash basis.  She also pays in cash when buying fabric and supplies.\r\n\r\nDiana has received two loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She used her first CrediKiva loan to buy fabric, thread, buttons, hats, gloves, scarves and sewing machines.  With this investment she plans to increase production and sales so in the future she will be able to reach her goal of opening a second sales point."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":729.37,"image":{"id":1371389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more supplies to increase production and sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-06-18T08:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-18T08:20:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Yulied","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":193851},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":224041},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":229269},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":234618},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":240093},{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":245695},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":251428},{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":257295},{"due_date":"2014-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":263298},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":269442},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":275729},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":315241}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.39,"local_amount":193851,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":196485.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968350,"comment":null},{"amount":119.49,"local_amount":224041,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":227086.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817526,"comment":null},{"amount":122.27,"local_amount":229269,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":232385.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323802,"comment":null},{"amount":125.13,"local_amount":234618,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":237806.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083031,"comment":null},{"amount":259.09,"local_amount":485788,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":492390.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732081,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T18:21:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572286,"name":"Darim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Darim is 62 years old and lives with her three daughters in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.

Her brother works at a construction site. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair work because in winter time, they are chilled to the bone. So she is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to purchase vacuum insulated windows, hardwood floors, shingles and a metal door. \r\n\r\nInstalling those items into her house will create a comfortable and warm place to live.

Besides her paddy rice growing business on 1.5 hectare of farmland, her husband also supplements the family income by fishing. \r\n\r\nSokim has had her current business for 11 years. This business gives her about 31,700 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nThis is not the first loan for Sokim with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).

After she completed her MBA program, she knew this was exactly the kind of product she wanted to create, and Real Natural Beauty was born with a mission to provide quality mineral and organic makeup designed for the multicultural woman.  \r\n\r\nDenise\u2019s primary goal for her business is to create a change in how we see ourselves and others. She believes strongly in the importance of self-confidence and strives to empower young women through her volunteer work and her business. As a volunteer with several middle school after-school and Young Life programs, Denise inspires and motivates young girls to realize their natural beauty, helping them discover that true beauty comes from within. \r\n\r\nStarting her business just last January, Denise has already experienced and overcome several challenges. One major challenge was finding local chemists, or makeup mixers, that could produce the unique color combinations needed to match and enhance the skin tones of her target market.  Through this whole process she has tried to work locally in every part of her manufacturing process, as partnering with local businesses is intrinsic to Denise\u2019s business model.\r\n\r\nHer $8,500 Kiva loan will enable Denise to pay for her start-up inventory and strategic marketing. Your help will also enable Denise to continue reaching out and empowering women to embrace their unique natural beauty.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Denise hopes to develop innovative initiatives to empower women internationally, working with local and international organizations geared towards women and child development.

is 32 years old.

It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNodari requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Nodari has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Nodari will open a bakery. After the bakery is opened, they will be able to bake Georgian bread for selling. As his mother has a rich experience in this field, Nodari thinks that the business will be profitable. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":544.44,"image":{"id":1371628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to open a bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gurjaani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-18T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-18T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nodari","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87.59},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":114.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":124.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":127.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.71},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.71,"local_amount":82.71,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":82.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613750,"comment":null},{"amount":87.59,"local_amount":87.59,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857462,"comment":null},{"amount":89.68,"local_amount":89.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":89.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134112,"comment":null},{"amount":93.07,"local_amount":93.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":93.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107699,"comment":null},{"amount":94.02,"local_amount":94.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":94.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255237,"comment":null},{"amount":97.37,"local_amount":97.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":97.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T12:49:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572365,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia is 56 years old and married with nine children, one of whom is in school.

","en":"Shuhrat is a kind and hardworking man.  He is married and has children.  Shuhrat is involved in growing rice.  He works on the rice field from March through November.  The photograph shows him at his place of business.  His brother, who has a lot of experience in growing various agricultural crops, helps him with this business.  Shuhrat has been involved in this business for over 7 years.  This year, he decided to lease more land than before.  Shuhrat plans to get a good rice harvest at the end of the year.  But this type of business is seasonal, and this is why he also drives a shuttle taxi in the city.  He plans to purchase mineral fertilizers and other chemicals with this loan.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a primary milk-producing area.

This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'saving money.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is transportation costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Sammy replied, 'he will be able to supply his produce on time.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Sammy owns the following: 'cow, poultry' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, electricity, solar power, TV' but does not have 'running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":215.72,"image":{"id":1371676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-18T17:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-18T17:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sammy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":52000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2292.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2353.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2415.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2479.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2545.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2612.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2681.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2752.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2825.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2976.77},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3055.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3136.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3218.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3304.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3391.77},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3572.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.71,"local_amount":2305.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2366.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960592,"comment":null},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":2356.41,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2418.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820264,"comment":null},{"amount":29.19,"local_amount":2428.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417346,"comment":null},{"amount":65.77,"local_amount":5471.99,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5616.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880887,"comment":null},{"amount":31.94,"local_amount":2657.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2727.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529509,"comment":null},{"amount":32.79,"local_amount":2727.78,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2799.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753423,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-19T04:16:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572410,"name":"Josie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josie works hard to support her family.

","en":"Zulfira is a kind and understanding 32 year-old woman.  She is a beautiful wife for her husband.  Her husband also loves and values her.  While they do not yet have children, they dream of having them.  They live in a small village.  Zulfira is involved in her own business to provide a consistent income for living.  She is a dekhan farmer, who grows potatoes and then sells the harvest and earns a good income.  She has her own land for planting potatoes; the size of the land is 1 hectare.  Zulfira's husband helps her with this business.  When it is time to gather and sell the harvest, he organizes this work.  They also raise livestock to earn additional income.  They have several heads of livestock.  Zulfira milks the cow by herself in the mornings and sells the milk to her neighbors.  At the present time, Zulfira and her husband want to increase their income because they dream of having a child in the near future and need to set up favorable conditions in their home.

is Rahiema, 33, a resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is single and lives with her parents, helping them manage their household. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRahiema operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php16,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nRahiema hopes that her variety store becomes a grocery store.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and she draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is 44 years old. He lives in a small village, Tkemlovana, in Chiatura district, with his retired parents and two children (13 and 15 years old). Several times, Koba requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKoba's family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have milk cows, bulls, two pigs, and a plot of land where haricot and maize are grown. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. Harvested products, along with the dairy products, are sold among the villagers. Koba also has a small grocery shop and he earns a daily income.  The family's additional income is from Koba\u2019s parents' monthly pensions. \r\n\r\nKoba requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Koba has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Koba will purchase a mini-bus. He wants to start trading in fruits and vegetables. Since his village is far from the city center and it\u2019s hard for the locals to access certain products, Koba, with his mini bus, will go to the big market in Chiatura district, purchase fruits, vegetables, and other products, and bring them to his village to resell to the villagers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Koba will help his villagers and will also have increased the income of his family.

is married with a little child. Together with her husband Zhora, who is also in the photo, she runs a farm. Their farm currently includes 22 chickens, a cow and a calf. Anna milks the cow and uses milk in cheese production. Zhora sells agricultural products in the market and gets income which is vital for their family's living expenses. Anna would like to enlarge the family's farming business since agriculture is their only source of income. As Anna has no financial means for doing so, she has applied for this loan.

His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. Givi works at the local furniture workshop as a security guard and his son works at the Tbilisi National Airport as a cleaner. They both earn small monthly salaries, and this is the only source of living for their family.\r\n\r\nGivi requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Givi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Givi will pay the customs fees for his car. Givi wants to start trading in cheese.

They are located in a small neighborhood called Panim\u00e1, which is in Totonicapan, Guatemala. They describe their community as: \"Totonicap\u00e1n, land of apples, pines, and beautiful women.\" Totonicap\u00e1n is one of the leading producers of popular Guatemalan crafts, which are in high demand because of their variety and quality. \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas is in its sixth loan cycle. Some of its members have stayed with the group and others are relatively new. \r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic member of the group is Mrs. Santos. Her name is derived from the fact that she was born on Holy Thursday, a holy week in Guatemala. She is 62 years old and has nine children, three girls and six boys. Her business involves dying yarn. She purchases raw yarn, makes a variety of dyes. and produces finished yarn in different colors and in large quantities. She started her business 24 years ago when she learned it from her husband\u2019s family. She has now taught her children the technique. \r\n\r\nSantos will use the loan to buy raw materials in bulk because the price is favorable. She has a good demand for her products. One of her main customers wants to have orders delivered every 15 to 20 days. This request is for a customer 3\u00bd hours away from Santos's home. The demand makes Santos very happy because there are currently three people working for her business but if she has higher demand it might be a possible to employ more people. \r\n\r\nSantos is very thankful to all Kiva lenders for providing her with the opportunity to improve her business.  The loans are not only helping the women because the profit that they make will also benefit their children.  \r\n\r\nLas Manzanas is grateful to Kiva investors for the loans they are giving. Thanks to these microloans they can move forward. They are aware that the economic situation in the country and around the world is difficult and are thankful that people trust them and are allowing them to boost rural development.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2966.24,"image":{"id":1369002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy raw materials in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -91.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":5925,"lender_count":184,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Matilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Florinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pascuala Mercedes Faustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":46300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3863.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3804.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":486.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":494.37,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564177,"comment":null},{"amount":494.38,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813234,"comment":null},{"amount":494.37,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089104,"comment":null},{"amount":494.37,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855073,"comment":null},{"amount":494.37,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503409,"comment":null},{"amount":494.38,"local_amount":3863.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3866.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T13:24:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574147,"name":"Toafa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Toafa is a 29-year-old married woman with two children.

The trainings were taught by the staff of Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we reported about Gladys, one of the hardworking women who supports herself, her two daughters and her sick father.

With her previous loan, Gladys was also able to purchase pigs to fatten up and sell. Recently, she got a one-year job as a cleaning lady from an organization in her community. Because of this, she closed her store but continues to sell food and snacks called \u201crefacciones\u201d in the front yard of her home to local residents every weekend. At the current time, Gladys has requested an additional loan, which she will use to purchase additional ingredients to make snacks.

She is hopeful that Kiva investors will decide to show their confidence in the group by providing the funds for a new loan cycle.

She states, \"On behalf of the group, I thank the many people around the world who have placed their trust in each of us. We appreciate the trust that they have in us and their thoughtfulness in saving some money to invest in our businesses. We know that we face a better and more prosperous future because of this.

Since Ana became widowed two years ago, she has the sole responsibility of providing the basic needs to her children who range in age from 7 to 17.\r\n\r\nAna raises animals and currently has two dozen chickens and three pigs. She is able to generate an income for her family but wishes to grow her business. She is requesting a loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to buy more chickens and four more pigs. With the loan, she will be able to purchase feed for fattening up the animals, which she will sell in the nearest market, 20 minutes from her community.\r\n\r\nAna says that this loan means a lot to her since it is the first time she has been able to secure a loan. She has learned a lot about effective business practices including how to budget and manage working capital so that she can make a profit and grow her business. She appreciates the encouragement and support of the other women in her Trust Bank.\r\n\r\nIn her own words, \u201cI dream of a better future and I understand that it will not come along by itself. We need to work hard to make our dreams come true. I dreamed of having a business but I did not have enough capital. Now that I have a loan, I can work hard, earn an income, keep my children in school and have a better future.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2687.52,"image":{"id":1373431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy chickens and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Quetzaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.833333 -91.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julisa Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debora Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Silvia Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heidy Damaris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":31300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3483.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3434.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":441.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390564179,"comment":null},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399813236,"comment":null},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089106,"comment":null},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855075,"comment":null},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503411,"comment":null},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":3483.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728395,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-19T16:36:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573878,"name":"Fatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here is Fatu, a small-scale businesswoman in Kabala, a town in northern Sierra Leone.

The loan will be used to buy more fresh food such as raw bananas for selling, and will help Jesca to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Jesca hopes that in the future, she will be able to improve on her family's standards of living. \r\n\r\nJesca is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past two years, Angella has been working hard to manage her clothing store which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Angella has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale as well as will help Angella to generate greater profits and improve her family standards of living. Angella hopes that, in the future, she will be able to build rental houses. \r\n\r\nAngella is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills

For the past three years, Venessa has been working hard to manage her clothes store, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Venessa has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for selling, and will help Venessa to generate greater profits and improve her family's stardands of living. Venessa hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nVenessa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 21 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Florence has been working hard to manage her clothes store, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for selling, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Florence hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

is 21 years old and lives in the town of Lugazi in the Mukono region of Uganda.

For the past one year, Hafisa has been working hard to manage her clothes store, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hafisa has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more clothes for selling, and will help Hafisa to generate greater profits and improve her family's standards of living. Hafisa hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand her clothes business into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nHafisa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

For the past 3 years, Betty has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks, sodas and snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Betty has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more drinks, such as soda, and snacks to sell. This will help Betty to generate greater profits and take care of herself. Betty hopes that in the future she will be able to become a powerful business woman in town. \r\n\r\nBetty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Jane has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soft drinks, sodas and snacks. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has asked for a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy snacks and more drinks such as sodas to sell in her shop. This will help Jane to make bigger profits, and buy another fridge for the business. Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children up to university. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":272.11,"image":{"id":1373222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saj is a group composed of three Lebanese women living in a village in Mount Lebanon. They live close to each other and have strong friendship bonds. Their difficult living conditions made them join hands and form the group in order to acquire a group loan from Al Majmoua. Maha is the leader and featured member of this group. She is a 40-year-old married mother of two children, standing in the center of the picture. Her husband owns a small business where he makes and sells pastry, and she works there in order to help him with the baking and to maximize the profit. However, because they live in a small village, their revenue is limited to the number of customers. They earn barely enough to provide for their children, especially since they are both enrolled in private schools, which means that the schooling fees are somewhat of a burden. She decided to acquire a loan in order to purchase ingredients and machines that would facilitate the baking process.\r\n\r\nInes is a 30-year-old married mother of two children, standing on the left in the picture. She owns a hairdressing salon in the village. Her husband owns a pick-up and earns his living my fulfilling requests.

For the past three years, Faridah has been working hard to manage her small market business selling raw bananas. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Faridah has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more raw food such as matooke, Irish potatoes and sweet potatoes, and will help Faridah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Faridah hopes that in the future, she will be able to become a powerful businesswoman in town. \r\n\r\nFaridah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

For the past two years, Irene has been working hard to manage her brick business, which does brick laying. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 250,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy firewood and also to pay her workers, and will help Irene to generate greater profits and improve her family's standard of living. Irene hopes that in the future she will be able to become a powerful businesswoman in town. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She dreams of giving her children the opportunity to enter into higher education and graduate as professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":488.83,"image":{"id":1365666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise for her clothes store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Rionegro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T12:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T12:00:30Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":99476},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":102203},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":105005},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107883},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110841},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":113879},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":117001},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":120209},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":123503}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":111062,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":116021.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382165167,"comment":null},{"amount":54.51,"local_amount":99117,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":103543.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390982202,"comment":null},{"amount":55.89,"local_amount":101623,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":106160.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822033,"comment":null},{"amount":60.82,"local_amount":110585,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":115523.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807045,"comment":null},{"amount":61.71,"local_amount":112206,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":117216.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095144,"comment":null},{"amount":63.12,"local_amount":114759,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":119883.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074231,"comment":null},{"amount":131.7,"local_amount":239463,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":250156.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009437,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T17:43:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574351,"name":"Fathiyeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fathiyeh is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.<p>\r\n\r\nFathiyeh is a 45-year-old married mother of four from Al Nosirat, near Deir el Balah city.
