This group is located in the community of Palma Cuata, which is known for being a small community surrounded by sugar cane fields and whose people are very cheerful and friendly and work in the fields.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Antonio, or To\u00f1o as he is called in the community, is 41 years old and he is married to Griselda.  He tells us that he does not have much schooling and that his family has always been in the business of driving taxis.  He drove one of his father's taxis for several years and saved up, as his goal was to buy his own taxi so that his earnings would be free and so he could be independent.  After a little over ten years of work he was able to get his own taxi.  He works every day from eight in the morning until eight in the evening and he does not take days off, as holidays and weekends are when he has the most work.  He tells us that over the years he has acquired many customers and he even goes to their front doors when they call him.

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEliza requested a loan from Credo to start her family business. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for a business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. \r\n\r\nWith the credit, Eliza will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. She will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard, raise them, and sell them for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She tells us that she enjoyed very much working with the institution and that is why once again she requested a new loan. Eva lives in a small municipality called Ixtlahuaca, which means \"uninhabited land\". This is a very nice area with a large plaza where vendors sell clothing, vegetables, fruit, shoes, etc. on Mondays. \r\n\r\nEva is 32 and has been married to Juan Carlos for six years. They have four children, three of whom have not yet started school. Eva has four salons in Ixtlahuaca. She started her business because she studied styling and then started working. She greatly enjoyed tending to her clients, and so she decided to open her own salon. Afterwards, bit by bit, she opened the other salons. The salon which she herself tends to, and where we did the interview, has been open for seven years. During the interview, she told us that the last loan helped her a lot because she was able to buy the supplies to work for awhile without worrying a shortage of supplies. \r\n\r\nThis time, she is requesting a loan to buy new of dyes and treatments that she is launching. She also wants to buy flat irons and hear dryers and perhaps new furniture.  \r\n\r\nIn her business, she does not see any difficulty by which she has to worry about. She is doing very well. Nevertheless, Eva commented 'I would be very happy to have more products to have more clients, the products many times are very costly.  If my clients come to me for treatment, having more products allow me to perform without any difficulty because I have the material available.

The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, they run a small dairy farm of two calves and two milk cows, whose milk is used for dairy production. Manana produces cheese, which she sells at the local market. In addition, they grow haricots and maize on family-owned land. Part of the harvested produce is sold at the local open market, and the rest is used for the family's needs. Manana works hard, but the family still doesn\u2019t have enough income to save and use to improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nManana has applied for this loan to increase the number of cows and renovate her house. With the requested loan she plans to purchase an additional milk cow. This will allow her to produce more milk from her dairy and increase her sales, which provide her main income. The rest of the money will be used for house renovation. Manana will purchase construction materials and repair the house, which is old and damaged. This will give her an opportunity to improve her family's living conditions.

She has a 24-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter.  She dreams of her daughter becoming a successful professional.  Magaly has owned her own business for the past five years.  She started her business after having worked for several years in a school and also in a small business.  She was keen to start working independently, so she decided to make the most of her culinary experience and the fact that she is a good cook and start making cakes to sell to her neighbors.  Her customers paid her every two weeks when they had money from work.  This business went very well and she later decided to make the most of her existing customer base and satisfy more of their needs and wishes.  A friend recommended that she started selling catalog products.  She put a lot of effort and enthusiasm into this new business and experienced really good results.  She now sells both cosmetics and cakes and her customers are not only her neighbors but also other people who they have recommended her to. \r\n\r\nMagaly's current goal is to fill the orders that her customers have placed for 'love and friendship day' (the Colombian equivalent of St Valentines Day which is celebrated in late September).  She is requesting a Kiva loan so that she can fill their orders in a timely manner because the challenge she faces is that she doesn't have enough working capital to do this.  Magaly will use her Kiva loan to buy products such as shampoos, massagers, creams, soaps and makeup in larger quantities.  She will also invest in buying supplies for making cakes.  With this investment, she plans to fill her customers' orders for 'love and friendship day' and this is one of the reasons she will be successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1204161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Local dance traditions are also alive and well here.  The festejo, lando, zamacueca and other dances are typical of this area.  Carmen likes to listen to music in her spare time.  She also tells us that she likes a popular local dish called \"juane\".  She would have liked to have studied economics, but she wasn't able to finish school because her family didn't have the money to pay the fees.\r\n\r\nCarmen has a small beauty products business.  She also works 9 hours a day at a \"fundo agricola\" [not sure--a food processing plant, perhaps?].  Some of her co-workers there are also customers of her beauty products business.

Khalil is photographed in his store. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She already has had a number of years running her business and it is going very well since she has increased the number of customers and she always tries to stock her stand with seasonal fruit, which help increase her sales.  Tania says that she sells more during the season of zafra (when the indigenous people produce sugar) in order to make a little more money.  \r\n\r\nA credit from VisionFund will give Tania the opportunity to buy a variety of seasonal fruit such as watermelon, melon, pineapples, papaya, bananas, oranges and mandarines.

For the past 2 years, Mona's husband has had a stall selling roasted peanuts and different types of sweets, which is located in a good movement area and near to local schools. It is the only source of income to the family, which needs more support to cover the costs. Mona is requesting a 1,500 USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing more roasted peanuts and sweets that customers often request and buy. This will increase sales and improve the family's

is a 22-year-old single man. He is a rickshaw driver with a low salary which is the only source of income for him. It is not enough to cover his costs of living.\r\n\r\nMostafa wants to improve his income and his standard of living by purchasing his own rickshaw. He is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new rickshaw to use for transporting goods from one area to another on customers' requests. This will increase Mostafa's capacity to work extra hours and enable him to take on additional internal requests, which will improve his income and ensure him a better future. \r\n\r\nMostafa is photographed next to the rickshaw he will buy.\r\n\r\n<u>About Shariah-compliant lending:<\/u>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He has borrowed a loan of 500,000 UGX in order to buy two bulls that he will fatten within a period of three months and then sell at a profit. He currently has a stock of three bulls and the demand has increased, and that's why he opted to borrow money and restock his bulls. \r\n\r\nFenehas says that he still faces a major challenge of insufficient land to graze his animals and at times he is forced to rent land from neighbours.

is a 55-year-old, married woman and a mother of two grown-up children from Getafe, Bohol, in the Philippines.

It will help Judith to generate greater profits and pay for school fees. \r\n\r\nJudith hopes that in the future she will be able to live a good life and be self reliant. \r\n\r\nJudith is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Judith who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans
