","en":"Barnokhon is 44 years old and a widow.  Alone, she is raising four children (two sons and two daughters).  After her husband's death, Barnokhon could not get over the loss of such a close person for a long time.  She needed to raise and get four children on their feet, and Barnokhon decided to take the household and financial responsibility into her own hands.  Her children help her with this.  The oldest son works in Russia, and the youngest works as a welder.  Both sons support the family financially as they can, sending their salaries home monthly.  Barnokhon has a secondary education.  The neighbors speak of her as an entrepreneurial and organized woman.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, Barnokhon has been involved in sales of bedding, blankets and table cloths since 2010, having started this business with 60,000 som (KGS).  Farming also yields an income.  She has a 1.14 hectare land plot, where she annually plants onions, potatoes and cabbage.  Her business yields about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  The income from the business allowed Barnokhon to raise and situate her children.  In order to further develop her business, Barnokhon requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy merchandise, such as bedding, table cloths and blankets, wholesale for future retail sale.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to increase her goods turnover and also to rebuild her house in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":518.75,"image":{"id":1413398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

","en":"Mehry is 38 years old.  She is a kind and goal-oriented woman.  She is married and has four children. She and her family live in northern Tajikistan.  The children are all still minors and are in secondary school.  Mehry's husband is a migrant worker in Russia.  Mehry herself has been a secondary school teacher for over 10 years.

Local business has developed in a significant manner thanks to the entrepreneurship of its citizens who have created opportunities and work to make this a reality. \r\n\r\nRa\u00fal has worked independently in the manufacturing of cement blocks for twenty years now, starting just after he got married. As his parents taught him this work when he was very young he started as an expert in the field. He puts in 8 to 10 hours at work without any major complications. He enjoys his work in spite of having to mix the material at his house as he does not have his own mixing machine.

She grew up with her parents who worked growing organic cacao. She learned the family business since she and her siblings helped with the minor tasks. When she turned 24, Reyna had her first child and became independent from her parents. They gave her a small plot of land to work alongside her then husband. After her separation, Reyna decided to take on the beautiful responsibility of being father and mother for her small children, working the land that she had grown over time. She worked to be a great example of progress despite the difficulties of her life. Reyna considers the work she does very self-sacrificing. Every day she heads out to her land to maintain and care for her organic cacao plantations so that at the time of the harvest they will be high-quality ears and suitable seeds to sell to the merchants.

Yaneth works in the fields cultivating cocoa and coffee to support her family.  She does this work with the support of her husband on 2 hectares of land.  She tries to always keep her crops in good condition, because this will allow her to obtain good quality beans in the harvest which she can sell at a good price.\r\n\r\nWhen the harvest time arrives, she hires more people to support her in collecting the mature beans.  Later she dries them outdoors, and later sells them to the traders in the city.  In the future, she hopes to buy another plot of land where she could start cultivating turmeric in order to obtain more income.  This is her first loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she is receiving so that she can continue to make progress.  She promises to make her payments on time.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, she wants to borrow 2,000 Peruvian soles to purchase organic fertilizer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":465.85,"image":{"id":1416640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":298.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":308.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":333.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":344.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":349.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":365.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":298.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":305.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399865293,"comment":null},{"amount":111.94,"local_amount":308.8,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":315.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353667,"comment":null},{"amount":120.8,"local_amount":333.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":340.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905429,"comment":null},{"amount":124.77,"local_amount":344.21,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":352.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-24T22:53:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597043,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is a 48-year-old married mother of five children, four of them at the primary school.

She is married to Luis who is a businessman and father of their three children ages 7, 5, and 1.  They live in a rented house along with Ana's sister and brother-in-law.  Ana works selling regional fruits and drinks of varied flavors.  For this reason she sets up a table in front of her home every day where she arranges her fruits and juices and offers them, getting rather good business due to her kind treatment and the good flavor of her drinks.  She began this business more than two years ago, and until now she has been doing everything alone, but on occasions her sister helps her.  For that reason, now seeing the good results that she is getting, she wants to continue with her business and begin selling food products and therefore she wants to open a store in her home.  This will be her fourth loan from Kiva and she is very thankful for the financial support she receives in order to get ahead.  In addition, she promises to make her payments on time.

Her husband works as a security staff person.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlba has been managing a bakery for 12 years.  She learned this type of work when she and her sister used a small oven for baking.  They made bread for household consumption.  Later on, Alba decided to make bread for the residents of her community in addition to her own family so that she could generate income.  Now her bread production has increased steadily and she has employees who live in the same community and work in the bakery.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy flour, sugar, yeast, eggs, and other supplies for making bread.  This enables her to provide daily sustenance for many people who must get up early in order to leave for work.

He is married but does not yet have any children. He is a farmer, who from a very young age has worked in agriculture, thanks to the traditions and teachings of his father. Currently he grows coffee beans, which are harvested and sold in the market place of the town where he lives. This way, he earns enough money to cover his household expenses. \r\n\r\nHe is a thriving and hard-working man who is passionate about his work, and despite the obstacles he faces due to his lack of capital to fertilize his crops, he always looks for a way to move forward.

Luego de culminar sus estudios secundarios y al cumplir la mayor\u00eda de edad, le fue f\u00e1cil conseguir empleo en el \u00e1rea comercial, gracias a su actitud creativa y esp\u00edritu emprendedor. Actualmente trabaja como asesora de telemercadeo en una empresa de call center. Pero con la necesidad de generar ingresos adicionales, encontr\u00f3 la oportunidad de montar su propio negocio de alquiler de video juegos por horas, aprovechando que en el sector donde reside no exist\u00eda este tipo de comercio. Luz es muy activa, en\u00e9rgica y trabajadora, pero ha tenido algunas dificultades con su negocio, pues \u00e9ste s\u00f3lo lo puede abrir a partir de las 5:00 pm, hora en la que culmina su jornada laboral en la empresa, generando un vac\u00edo que puede aprovechar otra persona para montar la competencia. Sin embargo, esto no la detiene, por el contrario se anima a seguir luchando para salir adelante. Por esta raz\u00f3n solicita su primer ciclo de cr\u00e9dito, con el fin de invertirlo en la compra de activos fijos (televisor y un play station) para acreditar a\u00fan m\u00e1s su negocio y poder suplir la demanda actual que posee, pues los clientes algunos d\u00edas deben hacer fila para poder acceder al servicio. Esto le ayudar\u00e1 a avanzar para cumplir el sue\u00f1o de independizarse completamente, pues espera que su negocio le genere los ingresos necesarios para apoyar a su esposo con la carga econ\u00f3mica del hogar y poder disfrutar de un futuro prometedor a mediano plazo.","en":"Luz, who is only 19 years old, lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. After finishing her secondary education and turning 18, it was easy for her to find employment in the business sector, thanks to her creative attitude and entrepreneurial spirit. Currently she works as a telemarketing consultant at a call centre company. But with the need to earn an additional income, she found the opportunity to start her own business renting video games by the hour, as in the area where she lives there is no other business like it.\r\n\r\nLuz is very active, energetic and hard-working, but she has had some difficulties with her business, as she can only open from 5 pm, when she finishes work at the call centre, leaving a gap that someone else could fill and create competition. However, this has not stopped her - on the contrary, she has decided to keep on fighting to get ahead. This is why she is asking for her first loan, with which she intends to buy fixed assets (a television and PlayStation) in order to consolidate her business and to be able to fulfil the current demand that is there, as some days clients have to queue in order to access the service.\r\n\r\nThis will help her get closer to achieving her dream of becoming completely independent, as she expects her business to generate enough income to help her husband with the household expenses and so be able to enjoy a promising future in the medium-term."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.66,"image":{"id":1416754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to buy fixed assets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-08-24T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-23T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":71433},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":73404},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75429},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":77510},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":79648},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":81846},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":84103},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":86424},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88808},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91258},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":93775},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":96362}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.51,"local_amount":73354,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T09:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":74155.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400822394,"comment":null},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":70098,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70864.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807423,"comment":null},{"amount":38.35,"local_amount":73044,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":73842.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095512,"comment":null},{"amount":42.55,"local_amount":81039,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":81924.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074572,"comment":null},{"amount":39.45,"local_amount":75138,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":75959.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-25T12:26:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597152,"name":"Caridad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caridad is from the village of Sto.

Her husband helps her with the business. Eleonora provides the sole source on income for her family by fattening and selling livestock. She began doing this 20 years ago by spending 2,000 som (KGS) to buy animals. Thanks to her tireless work, Eleonora today owns seven horses, four cows, one heifer, one bull calf, and five sheep, and also has a 0.89 hectare land plot where she plants wheat each year. Her monthly income is 9,500 som (KGS). With the goal of further developing her business Eleonora is asking  the micro finance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a 70,000 som (KGS) loan to buy livestock for fattening and sale. She plants to invest the profit earned into further expanding her herd of livestock, and plans to save for the education of her younger children.

old, widowed, and has four children. She had a hard time after the death of her husband, but she gathered her strength and decided to keep going for her children. Of her children, her oldest daughter provides material help, since she sells groceries at the market. The rest of the children help around the property. Kaiyrkul provides the primary source of income for her family by raising and selling livestock. She started the business in 2008 by spending 25,000 som (KGS) on buying animals. Thanks to her tireless work and the active participation of her children, she now owns 2 bull calves and four sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).

","en":" Zokirjon is 47 years old. He lives in the Shahrituz Region. He is married and has two sons and one daughter. Zokirjon has a college degree. He is a professional accountant. At present Zokirjon intends to launch a retail business. He has built a store, 10x4 meters [about 33\u2019 x13\u2019 ], in his village and plans to sell groceries and household goods there. He has 1,500 USD remaining. This sum is insufficient to stock up merchandise for the shop. This is why Zokrijon turned to the MLO Humo for support.

For the past two years, Grace has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells posho, rice, and sugar. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Grace has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase soap, posho, and rice for the shop to sell and will help Grace to generate greater profits and to boast the business. Grace hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy land and build a home. \r\n\r\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 52 years old and is from the town of Chiatura in the Imereti Region. She is married and the mother of two grown sons. Tamar\u2019s retired sister-in-law lives with them. Tamar graduated from pedagogical college and works as a music teacher at the local music school. Tamar\u2019s young son is a cook at the restaurant and earns a small salary. Unfortunately, their income is too small and hardly enough to cover food and every day expenses for the family of five. \r\n\r\nSo, Tamar decided to start a clothing-trading business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Tamar\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, called the Startup Program that gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $600, she will purchase clothing at a wholesale price and sell them in her community door-to-door. Her regular customers will be her coworkers and neighbors. She plans to sell a wide assortment and well-priced clothing for men, women and children. It is obvious that the job is hard for Tamar, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually. The start-up credit will be a great support for the family, as their income will be significantly increased with regards to Kiva Lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":177.5,"image":{"id":1413529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chiatura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-25T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-24T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.52,"local_amount":39.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":39.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134343,"comment":null},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":45.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":45.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107924,"comment":null},{"amount":45.7,"local_amount":45.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":45.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255458,"comment":null},{"amount":47.27,"local_amount":47.27,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019588,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T02:09:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":597237,"name":"La","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"La is a 52-year-old woman married with six children.

is 42 years old, divorced and has two adult sons. She lives in a minority community. Danijela is currently staying home and receives a social pension. She has had a very difficult life because she had to raise two children on her own, as she has been divorced for more than 15 years now. The family's main income comes from her sons who are working as construction workers.\r\n \r\nDanijela\u2019s family has had a problem with their bathroom for a long time and doesn't have the money for repairs. The money that her sons earn through their work is not enough to pay for the repairs.

She lives with her spouse who works as a driver for a private company and gets a monthly salary. Aza co-ordinates newspaper kiosks located in her town and earns a monthly salary as well. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her existing income is not enough to cover everyday costs and also help her children living in the village near the town where Aza lives. So, Aza decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Aza\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received credit within the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives vulnerable poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

Beka is an assistant of the operator at the local asphalt factory and gets a monthly income. His parents run an agricultural business and grow peaches in their garden. They also graft the plants and sell them in the capital city open market and also sell picked peaches. \r\n\r\nBeka requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but had no success. His loan request was rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in the new business. Recently, Beka requested credit from Credo. He was planning to start-up the animal husbandry business. His loan request was approved, through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.
