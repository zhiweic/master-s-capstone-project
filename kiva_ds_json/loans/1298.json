is a 21-year-old young man from the village of Tskalporeti. He lives with his sister and mother, who is disabled and gets an invalid pension of 150 GEL monthly. Mukhran is a really hard-working man and is highly involved in agricultural activities. He has one milk cow and a small part of its production is sold locally. He also takes care of cattle. The family belongs to the poor category, as they don't have any significant income to meet their basic needs. \r\n\r\nMukhran's credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements. He received this credit in the framework of the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo - the Start-Up Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With this loan of 2,000 GEL, Mukhran will open a metal workshop, buy all the needed tools and equipment, and get private orders. Mukhran thinks that the business will be profitable, as it is in a great location and it's the only business of this kind in the area. After the metal workshop is opened, the family will have a stable income which enables them to cover everyday costs as well as expand the business in the future.

She has applied for this loan of USD 1,500 in order to be able to purchase forage for feeding the livestock during the winter season. Tehmine took a loan from a local financial institution before, but because of the hard financial conditions of the family, she wasn't able to pay it back on time.\r\n\r\nHowever, thanks to hard work during recent times, Tehmine was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n\r\nThe loan will greatly assist Tehmine to continue running her farm successfully and she will be very grateful for the loan."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for forage for feeding the livestock during the winter season.

She would like to buy a new sewing machine with functions that will allow her to work with better quality materials newly available in her area; she would also like to buy a small generator that will allow her to better plan and manage her work time without the constant interruptions caused by frequent power cuts in her area due to lack of infrastructure. \r\n\r\nTo be able to make these purchases, Ebtisam is taking a group loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

She makes different agricultural products and sells them to local retailers. \r\n\r\nTo enlarge her business and improve her farm Shahane requested a loan from SEF International, which she will use to purchase two cows and renovate the barn.

Nancy has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised. She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNancy is 44 years old and has been a farmer for 23 years. She works as a farmer to provide for her five children. The community and other farmers know Nancy as friendly, hard-working, reliable and trustworthy. Other than farming, she is also involved in community groups such as the women's group, savings group and prayer group. Nancy described her harvest last year as good, but she hopes to have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nNancy first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Nancy joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods and obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nNancy plans to use the money she earns from her next harvest to send children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Nancy\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Nancy and the Emukaya Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues to provide training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-15T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Redson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abiud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T21:15:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645420,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is a 30-year-old married man with seven children, only four of whom are attending school.

She is married and she and her husband have 9 children. Theirs is the largest and most respected family in the village. All their children are married and live their own independent lives with their own families. The youngest son, who is also married and has three children, still lives with Toktosun. Toktosun has devoted her whole life to children.\r\n\r\nToktosun has high-school level education and, as the main source of income for her family, she rears cattle, having started 23 years ago when she purchased  livestock for 10,000 Kyrgyz Soms. Thanks to Toktosun's hard work, she currently has 7 dairy cows, 41 sheep, 3 goats and 7 horses on her farm. In the past, she has used her income from her farming to pay for her sons' weddings and give her daughter away to be married with a dowry. Her monthly income is 15,000 soms. With the aim of further developing her farm, Toktosun came to the Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to help her buy two bull-calves, which will increase the quantity of her livestock. She would use the income gained from the loan to further increase her numbers of livestock and plans to save money to build new accommodation for the livestock.

His son helps him sell the agricultural products in the local market. This is a very important source of income for them.<br \/><br \/>To continue running his agribusiness in a sustainable way, Hrayr needs a loan of USD 2600. He will use the loan to purchase fertilizer, forage for cattle, and potato seeds. He has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately he wasn't able to repay it back. However, thanks to hard work during more recent times, Hrayr has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

However, thanks to hard work during more recent times, Shogher has been able to run her business in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

So, agriculture helps the family to have a stable income during the month and to cover their basic costs. \r\n\r\nNow, by applying for this loan, Osana would like to purchase seeds of greens and a polyethylene cover for the greenhouse. She has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back.

He was born in Sigchos, a rural area in the Cotopaxi province, and lives in a rented room.

He also works as a helper for some friends who have carnival rides and go to the fairs around the city and other towns.  Edison wants to use his experience to set up his own business and wants to buy a jumping bed and establish a group.  His biggest obstacle is that he has never been able to get a loan to start his small business.\r\n\r\nEdison is the one who has provided all the financial support for his family, and this is why his mother supports him in all his decisions.

is an administrator in a hotel located in the central town of Masaka.  She is 34 years old and single with no children.  The management at her work recently decided that their energy costs have been too high, and they decided to switch from charcoal and firewood to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).  Prior to switching to LPG the hotel thought that LPG was more expensive than charcoal and firewood, a view shared by Penina.  However, once the initial start-up costs of purchasing an LPG unit are covered, running an LPG system is vastly cheaper than traditional energy sources.\n\nAfter seeing the cost savings made by the hotel, Penina also decided to switch to LPG so that she could save on the cost of charcoal and firewood.  Penina says that without a loan from Kiva she wouldn't have been able to make the switch.  She says she will now be able to cook a meal when she returns home from work in the evenings.  A charcoal stove takes a long time to heat and cook food, whereas her new LPG stove will be easy and quick."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay for a fast and clean cooking gas package to cook meals late at night","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":343,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":401000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-15T03:53:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657221,"name":"Abibatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 28-year-old Abibatu from Waterloo western rural area in Freetown.

Raikul is a homemake and has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 16 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS).  Raikul's husband works as an electrician and earns a set monthly salary.  Thanks to Raikul's hard work, today her business contains 1 dairy cow and also a 0.80 hectare land plot, where she grows beans and clover for sale. The monthly income amounts to 14,000 som (KGS).

They do not have biological children. Faridakhan is a very caring mother. Faridakhan has a secondary education. The primary source of income for the family is Faridakhan's work in livestock and farming. She started this business twenty years ago when she bought 6,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Faridakhan's hard work, her farm now has a dairy cow, a horse, two calves, and 1.28 hectares of land where she grows beans and potatoes. Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Faridakhan approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy a cow for breeding.

She is the profile member of Ruth Group and the featured borrower for the group. When her husband was alive, she used to sell charcoal and firewood in the town market on the northern side of Manipur state, which is about 35 km from the state capital. But she discontinued her charcoal selling business, as she could not leave the house for business purposes. She had to take care of the family and the kids at home. \r\n\r\nNengboi started running a grocery shop in front of her house. She sells all essential commodities like detergent soap, detergent powder, salt, toothpaste, edible oils, kerosene, onions, ginger etc. She usually gets the supplies from the nearest town market or in the capital market in Imphal. Most of the villagers buy commodities from the shop because the shop is located in the village itself and they don't have to spend extra money to go to the town market just to get a pack of salt. Because she doesn't have enough money to purchase supplies for sale, customers usually get irritated when their demands cannot be met.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase supplies from the army canteen at a low price and sell them. She is planning to open a savings account and start saving for the future. She says she will also repay the loan on time and try to expand her grocery shop. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for the generosity and love for the group members. She says, \u201cThank-You Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in raising cattle, pigs, poultry and other businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more items like edible oils and cereals to sell ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-14T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-13T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kimngah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thangbnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kainei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjanei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjoujam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657271,"name":"Mar\u00eda Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer de 63 a\u00f1os de edad, que se caracteriza por su tenacidad y su empuje, a pesar de las adversidades siempre se levanta con la frente en alto y sigue adelante, motivada por el amor a su hijo.

It seemed like a very good opportunity to her because health studies really grabbed her attention.  Her parents didn\u2019t have the kind of money that a university costs, so she would be able to put her skills into practice and earn some money to pay for her degree when she finished eleventh grade.\r\n\r\nIt was a little complicated to convince her parents because they have two other children who should also be given the chance to finish high school.  With the job that her father had, he didn\u2019t earn enough to be able to pay for all that his children needed.  In the school he would have to pay room and board, as well as other expenses.  The cost of a semester of nursing was a little bit affordable, and Juliana wanted to move ahead with this degree.  \r\n\r\nThe people from Campo Alto told Juliana\u2019s mother that the agreement would be in effect until she finished her degree, so they were going to pay monthly.  It went really well for Juliana for the three semesters that she studied.  In her third semester she did her practical training and it seemed really good to her to learn to care for someone who is sick, or for an elderly person.  When she went to sign up for her fourth semester, they told her that the payment agreement she had had was ending.\r\n\r\nIt seemed really bad to them that the agreement was ending, so a person from Campo Alto talked with them about an agreement with Kiva.  It is a little cheaper for her parents to be able to pay.

In particular, he has 2 cows and a plot of agricultural land, where nuts and mandarin trees are grown. They produce cheese products and sell them with the harvested products. As the income is only seasonal, Zurab decided to start a more stable business and requested a loan.

is a 40-year-old married man who lives in the village of Azizkendi with his wife, child, and retired parents. Rafig runs an agricultural business and grows various vegetables on his own piece of land as well as in a greenhouse.  He works hard all day long to earn his living, but his existing income is not enough to cover food and everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nThat is why Rafig decided to start another business. He applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved under the startup loan program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva.

Although her daughter is engaged, she still lives with Leonor in her home.\r\n\r\nLeonor learned dressmaking techniques in a school in the city several years ago.  With the end goal being to earn her own income and to help support her family, she installed a small sewing workshop in her home fifteen years ago.  Since then, she has made a living sewing all types of clothing and sheets; these are the items that she makes and sells the most.  She works to fill the orders from her customers while also selling the sheets that she makes with her customers' taste in mind.  Her work is of the highest quality.  She works every day.

She has a higher education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income.  She started in this field 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Ainur's hard work, her farming business now comprises 12 dairy cows, five horses, 30 sheep, as well as 2.76 hectares of land on which she grows potatoes and sainfoin for her own use and for resale.
