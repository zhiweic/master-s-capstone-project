She was unemployed for a number of months and, because of this, her family had financial problems, with Sandra's husband's salary not being enough to cover household costs.  Sandra therefore decided to start her own business: a bargain store, where she sells clothes, kitchen utensils, items for the home, and more.  She started this business a few days ago and it has provided her with a sufficient income to be able to help to stabilise the family's finances.  Sandra's perseverance, drive, and her constant efforts have helped Sandra to get ahead.  She is now applying for a loan in order to buy merchandise (blouses, jeans, underwear, kitchen utensils, and more) in bulk.  With these products she will be able to increase the variety of products she offers and can satisfy her customers' needs.  She will be able to increase her sales and her profits.  With these profits, Sandra tells us that she would like to improve her business and make it a profitable source of income which helps her to improve her living conditions and give her children a good upbringing and better well-being.

She owns an adobe home that she shares with other family members. She also has a business selling food from a location which she rents, which she has had for more than 6 years. She tells us that at the beginning she only had basic knowledge of how to prepare different dishes, but that through the demands of her customers she learned how to improve her cooking. Today, this has enabled her to have a lot of business, particularly with agricultural labors and transportation workers in her area. She is very grateful for her work because of the close relationships she has with her clients. She treats them well which enables her to establish these relationships. Luisa's long term goal is to improve her home so that she can later run her business from where she lives in order to avoid paying rent. \r\n\r\nThis is the third Kiva loan that Luisa has benefited from, and she is very grateful for the financial support that has allowed her to continue to get ahead.

He tells us that because of his family's poor economic situation, as a child his parents could no longer afford to send him to school. He is married, and his wife works in the home. They have five children who are all married adults, but he and his wife live with two grandchildren (10 and 12 years old) who they are in charge of taking care of. Both of these children are in school. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has worked in agriculture his whole life, planting basic grains, which he learned to do from his parents when he was little in order to help sustain the family economically. He continues this work to this day. In addition to agriculture, he also works as a day laborer, to support his family with additional income. To get to his jobs he has to walk 2 kilometers, which takes him 30 minutes. He receives help from his family and children with his crops. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is asking for is to collect his corn and bean harvests, and transfer the seeds and store them in a place where they will be kept safe. This will allow him to have a better quality seed and ensure a greater production of corn and beans for the rest of the year. He was in danger of losing his harvest if he didn't collect the seeds on time, but thanks to the loan he has received he is ok. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Jos\u00e9 wishes to improve his quality of life by having a better house. He will improve his harvests and provide a better standard of living for his children and grandchildren. He wants to watch them grow, continue to study, and be the people that society needs. He hopes that this loan will help him to get ahead, and that future loans he receives will allow him to grow his harvests and possibly even export them.

Her name is Nargis, and she is married.  Nargis is a homemaker and does not work, but really wants to open her own small business and become a successful businesswoman.  She wants to work by selling confections.  Nargis decided to take out a loan and use the money from the loan to purchase confectionery products for sale.

She learned this trade from a young age and currently uses it to generate income for her family. \n\nHer main crops are corn and potatoes.  She sells them in the city of Huancayo  and the country's capital.

","en":"Mahina is a young and very active woman, who is 24 years old.  She is married, but does not yet have children.  She lives with her husband in a small village.  Since young age, she has been entrepreneurial and capable young woman.  She always found an occupation or work that yielded a profit and was able to spend money for her needs.  She found a grocery outlet and started her own business.  Her merchandise consists of various children's goods, toys and some sweets.  At first, Mahina had a small selection of goods, but she gradually expanded her selection.  Today, her business is successful and brings her a good income.

He currently runs a poultry farm and transport business. He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine and a maize de-huller so that he can provide a milling service to over 450 families in his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Nason\u2019s community grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled and thickened to make what is locally called Nshima. The addition of a maize de-huller creates a further refined flour that is in high demand throughout the region. \n\nRent-to-Own has done extensive research in Nason\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest competitor is 2km away, but is often broken down, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. The addition of a maize de-huller is an extra attraction as those wanting the more refined maize flour will be able to have the processing done in the same place as they have their maize milled. This will also draw customers from neighboring communities.\n\nThe high cost of equipment such as a maize mill is  a major barrier, even for successful entrepreneurs like Nason. Once he secures a loan, Nason will be able to get both a maize mill and a de-huller from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his community, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nWith this maize mill and de-huller, Nason will be positioned to offer the only one-stop shop for maize milling in the area. He hopes to hire an additional employee to help with the day-to-day operation of the equipment. This loan will help Nason build on his successes as an entrepreneur and build up what will surely be a viable business that can provide a much needed service throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1474838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To obtain a maize de-huller and milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Nyimba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T00:20:05Z","loan_amount":6400,"lender_count":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nason","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":35450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":6100},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2550},{"due_date":"2014-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":11500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1101.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2076.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T23:15:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633977,"name":"Inmaculada Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Inmaculada es un grupo de ciudad del este, donde todas las integrantes vienen trabajando juntas hace 16 ciclos, ellas son mujeres muy entusiastas, que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n formando parte del programa de eliminaci\u00f3n de la pobreza, haciendo la encuesta de eliminaci\u00f3n de pobreza, para poder conocer la situaci\u00f3n en la que cada una est\u00e1.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

a 31 year-old resident of the city of Istaravshan.  She is married and has two sons.  Istaravshan means a lot to her.  This is where all of the closest to her people are, and this is where she is involved in business.  Nigorakhon and her family are involved in baking flatbread.  Almost 5 years of baking flatbread became a real family business for her.  Her husband mainly helps her.  They bake together and supply flatbread wholesale for sale.  Because Nigorakhon and her husband are honest people and love their work, they uphold a quality standard and their flatbread are the tastiest and delectable.  Nigorakhon wants to expand her small business and build another oven.  Then they will be able to make twice as much flatbread and thus have more income.  The portion of the loan will go toward repairing their house.  Nigorakhon has not been able to make repairs for many years because she did not have enough money.  It is very cold in Tajikistan in the winter and very hot in the summer.  Houses often need repairs.  Nigorakhon thanks You in advance for the help!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.3,"image":{"id":1472975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to build

Because of personal problems (illness)  she has had unanticipated bills and as the Christmas season approaches, it is good to invest as there is a lot of demand in the shop.\r\n\r\nThey need the working capital to take advantage of the opportunity presented to them and make better profits from their business.\r\n\r\nShe would like to maintain her business and be able to continue obtaining resources which enable them to meet their basic needs so the girls are not lacking for anything in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1472410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She is married and has a few children. She comes from a very friendly family, and they all live in the countryside.   Both Murabat and her son work in order to provide for the family and to bring some money home.  Everyone else helps as much as they can. \r\n\r\nMurubat's husband is retired, and therefore not working.  While Murabat's son works as a carpenter in a local shop and makes an average income, Murubat's main activity is animal husbandry.   She raises and sells livestock, an activity which is quite stable.   Her other children also help her with her work, taking care of the animals and selling the milk that they produce.  Murubat's animal husbandry business brings a good and stable income, which is the reason why she is now thinking of expanding her activity.  \r\n\r\nMurubad needs to buy a few more head of cattle for further breeding and resale.

He mainly grows tea, which he sells to provide the basic necessities for his children. He started farming in 2003, and has given it enough time to earn enough money from it. He started farming because he thought it was the only way to get money he needed, and growing tea was a cash crop that could grow in the area. He has applied for a loan of one million five hundred thousand shillings to buy fertilizers, so that the soil fertility can be boosted and give better yields. In addition to tea growing, Wilber has a small retail shop in the same area. That gives him additional income, which makes it a bit easier for him to raise funds to pay school dues for his children. However, the bad weather (rain), does not favor his tea and this reduces the quantity produced in a given period.  This decreases the profits, making it hard for him to supply the basic needs for his family members. Wilber strongly believes that by using the loan money to buy fertilizers to put in the tea garden, he will harvest much and will have more profits.

His business is located in Igara county in Bushenyi District, and his clients are cattle traders in his home area and nearby places. \r\n\r\nHe applied for a loan of 1,500,000 shillings so he can buy cows for trade so that he gets more profits in the month of December, which is a festive season. Lack of enough capital is his major challenge, but he hopes that it will be overcome if he gets the loan. He believes that he will be financially stable in the future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1475096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliphaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":126246.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863703,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-25T01:03:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":635698,"name":"Lawrence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lawrence is 50 years old and lives in the town of Mityana in the  region of Mubende in Uganda.

Her working day starts early, when she makes wholesale purchases from the local residents, who work with growing vegetables and fruit.

The children are small: Her son is 3 years old and the daughter was born this year (2013); she is not even one year old. Chynara has secondary education. Soon after finishing school she got married, at a very young age. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Chynara and her family work with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, just like the other people who live in the same village as them. Chynara started three years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nThanks to Chynara's persistent work, her farm currently has one horse, 20 sheep and also a plot of land of 0.57 hectares, on which she every year grows safflower and clover. An additional income is also her husband's small salary, which he gets form working as a shepherd, tending the horses of the inhabitants of their village for a certain price. Their total monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop their business, Chynara turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep for increasing the number of livestock.

She is married and she and her husband are raising two children. She has secondary-level education, having graduated technical college where she majored in sewing. She worked as a seamstress for 2 years, then she got married and since then has spent 23 years rearing animals and developing crops. She started this business with 5,000 Kyrgyz soms. She has been able to develop her livestock and farming activities. On her farm she has two calves and six sheep and also has a 1.8 hectare patch of land, on which she grows beans and clover. \r\n\r\nElmira's husband works transporting goods for their fellow villagers and he receives a small income.

She is originally from Managua, and is characterized as being hard-working, responsible, and having a desire for personal success. She has had to fight throughout her life to be able to survive with her children since she became a mother at a young age. Unfortunately, she couldn't stay in school because of her responsibilities as a mother and a lack of economic support. However, she works hard so her children can become professionals, which she hopes will come true soon.<br \/><br \/>Thanks to her efforts and her desire to move forward, she works by selling cosmetics from her home and by traveling to new and repeat customers. She works ten hours a day selling her products, which is work she enjoys doing. She will use this loan to invest in working capital and stock up her cosmetics business with items such as eye shadow, eyeliner, lipstick, blush, hydrating cream, perfume, anti-wrinkle cream, masking cream, make-up remover, and cleansing cream. In the near future, she hopes to have better income.

His father transports cargo on his truck.  \r\n\r\nShavkat now wants to start a livestock business.  He has the space to keep and breed animals. He stocked up on one part of the feed needed for his livestock, and the rest of the feed will come from harvesting his land. However, he doesn't have sufficient savings to purchase the livestock itself, and so Shavkat has applied for a loan. \r\n\r\nShavkat plans to buy five cows and calves each month from the cattle market in Shahrituz, fatten them and resell them in the same market, but at a higher price. Shavkat believes that it will be a profitable business, with stable income regardless of the season. By starting this business, he will finally be able to improve the financial situation of the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1474645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 5 cows and calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-23T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-22T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shavkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":391.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":402.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":413.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":425.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":437.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":449.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":461.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":474.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":488.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":501.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":515.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":530.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":545.2},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":560.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":576.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":592.3},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":608.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.87},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.62},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T14:18:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":635802,"name":"Jeanelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanelyn is a 30-years-old, single and she works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines and also earns additional income from a general store.
