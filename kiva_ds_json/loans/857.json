This area is known for its traditional craftsmanship.  Lisbeth produces bags and backpacks, but she also earns extra income by working part-time as a manicurist.  Family tradition influenced her to start this type of business.  When she was younger, Lisbeth would watch her mother make things, so she decided to earn income in this manner when she got married.  Her husband works as a milk dealer.

She also provides sewing services in the neighborhood where she lives.  Lisbeth produces children's clothes at very competitive prices and then sells them in town.  Her greatest challenge is having a sufficient amount of operating capital so that she can grow her business.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy thread in bulk, repair her sewing machine, and purchase supplies for strengthening her manicure and pedicure business.  The reason why her investment will be successful is because she has experience.  During this season, she receives many orders to help raise her income.

He makes a living selling fast food and has done this for 3 years when, as an observer, he identified the need to offer a nutritious and delicious fast food product. Initially he only sold patacones (fried plantains) with cheese and fried meat, but he gradually diversified his offerings, adding new lines of products like hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages with french fries, etc. Currently things are going very well for him and in the future a very organized business with more products than a restaurant is seen. His greatest challenge in meeting his growing demand is not having enough working capital to respond to it. This is the reason for which he turns to his Kiva loan with which he will buy raw materials and some fixed assets that he needs for his business, like plastic chairs and tables. The growth of his customers demands this and he is going to respond to it.

Her husband is a builder and now he works as a construction decorator in a private company. Their salaries do not usually suffice for the family's necessities. \r\n\r\nRecently she bought a small plot of land in the boundary area of Kherlen. Her family is planning to build a ger and fence it in. A ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt and it is comfortable to live in for small families. But it is quite cold in winter without the additional cover which is the same as wall insulation, and it costs a lot of money for the smoky coal which is used to warm the ger inside. Using the additional ger cover cuts the smoky coal usage notably and it contributes to reducing air pollution in the city. Air pollution and air quality is one of biggest issues in most Mongolian households and big cities. Mrs. Narantuya believes that her plan is environmentally friendly. The loan she is taking will be dedicated to buy the new ger cover and building materials to build the fence around her plot of land.

She\u2019s a person who collaborates with her fellow communal bank members\u2019 decisions.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2000 new soles requested now to hire day laborers to help her get rid of the weeds around her plants; she will use the rest to buy fertilizer for her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1091133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-05-17T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-16T17:20:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":257.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":262.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":278.02},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":284.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":295.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":306.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":315.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.93,"local_amount":257.88,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":263.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203128,"comment":null},{"amount":101.84,"local_amount":262.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":268.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098817,"comment":null},{"amount":107.73,"local_amount":278.02,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":284.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401666,"comment":null},{"amount":110.3,"local_amount":284.64,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":291.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455949,"comment":null},{"amount":114.32,"local_amount":295.03,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":301.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451603,"comment":null},{"amount":118.78,"local_amount":306.53,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":313.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446785,"comment":null},{"amount":122.1,"local_amount":315.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":322.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052726,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-25T01:16:33Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:24:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424063,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcelina tiene 48 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Esteban, de 51 a\u00f1os, y sus cuatro queridos hijos, a quienes brinda una buena calidad de vida. \n\nDesde muy tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana empieza su labor, primero prepara el desayuno para sus hijos y luego enviarlos a la escuela.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also retails mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Dwighta hopes to be able to expand soon. \r\n\r\nDwighta faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies. * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

From this marriage, she has three children, two adults and one 11-year-old who is in school. Two of their children still live at home.

There, she prepares delicious dishes that are the delight of her customers. She works every day and prepares breakfasts and lunches. She doesn't serve dinners because, she says, she gets very tired given that she gets up at 5 a.m. to prepare the meals. Plus, she works alone, so she takes the afternoons off. She has had her business for three years, and it's going very well.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to purchase rice, meat, fish, and other ingredients for the preparation of the meals. She has been in the Communal Bank for three years and she likes it because the first loan helped her set up her restaurant.\r\n \r\nHer dream is to improve her restaurant.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1090196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase rice, meat, fish, and other provisions.

Tes\u2019s priority in life is to provide a good standard of living and a good education for her children. This encourages her to work tirelessly at the rice field from dawn to dusk. Falling rain in the early part of the rainy season is a sign for Tes to start growing her rice crops. \r\n\r\nDue to a lack of funds for operating expenses, Tes would like to request a loan from HKL to rent a tractor to till her land.

de 51 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n de ropa para damas, caballeros e infantil; sus principales productos son blusas, pantalones, y vestidos. Esta actividad la inici\u00f3 desde sus 18 a\u00f1os, cuando aprendi\u00f3 por tradici\u00f3n, pues su madre tambi\u00e9n se dedic\u00f3 a ella y Odilia creci\u00f3 ayud\u00e1ndola. Sus deseos de superaci\u00f3n la llevaron a estudiar en el Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje \u201cSENA\u201d y terminar la carrera de Direcci\u00f3n Comercial; para poner en pr\u00e1ctica lo aprendido  con su prima dio apertura un taller de confecciones  en casa de su t\u00eda, con ello afianz\u00f3 sus conocimientos y adquiri\u00f3 mucha mas experiencia y una gran clientela,  hasta el punto que debi\u00f3 mudarse para ubicarse mas c\u00f3moda y estrat\u00e9gicamente.   Durante dos a\u00f1os trabaj\u00f3 con su prima en este taller, pero finalmente ella emprendi\u00f3 su viaje a otra ciudad y Odilia debi\u00f3 nuevamente re direccionar su propuesta sola,  como lo hizo durante 5 a\u00f1os en los que su microempresa creci\u00f3, se tecnific\u00f3 y se perfeccion\u00f3. Al organizar su familia y con el nacimiento de su hija, se concentr\u00f3 en ella durante 5 a\u00f1os y cuando estuvo todo listo para trabajar nuevamente, retom\u00f3 su arte, trabajando en diversos talleres como empleada, all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 la confecci\u00f3n de ropa de fiestas, vestidos de bodas y en general de alta costura. As\u00ed fue como al estar  preparada para emprender su propia aventura de negocios, su cu\u00f1ada fue quien la ayud\u00f3, pues a su nombre obtuvo el cr\u00e9dito de las primeras maquinarias y con ello el ejercicio de lograr clientes sostenibles, para poder pagar esta adquisici\u00f3n, con sus utilidades como efectivamente lo hizo. En la actualidad su estructura est\u00e1 conformada por 2 m\u00e1quinas planas, 1 fileteadora 1 maquina familiar, tiene aproximadamente 150 clientes y vende a cr\u00e9dito y de contado; ella para realizar la transacci\u00f3n pide un anticipo del 50% y el saldo, una vez entrega la prenda. Sus compras las realiza de contado en almacenes cercanos. As\u00ed mismo como vive con su hija de 15 a\u00f1os, esta la ayuda mucho en el negocio, porque tiene una fuente de creatividad inagotable,  que Odilia aprovecha,  pues es genial en el dise\u00f1o de las prendas, oficio que le apasiona. De su hija Odilia se siente muy orgullosa y todos los d\u00edas trabaja, para ofrecerle muchas oportunidades de que sea exitosa, en lo que a ella le guste, que es precisamente  la l\u00ednea de dise\u00f1os. Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario santo Domingo, mediante l cual comprar\u00e1 una m\u00e1quina industrial recubridora, para dar un mejor acabado a la prenda, una plancha a vapor y rollos de telas para elaborar vestidos femeninos y tener un stock que mostrar para el d\u00eda de las madres, una de las temporadas de mas movimiento comercial, en la que usualmente se incrementan las utilidades de Odilia, que la ayudan al cumplimento de sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Odilia, 51, makes clothes for women, men and children.  Her main products are blouses, pants and dresses.  She started this work at the age of 18 when she learned it by tradition because her mother was also in this occupation and Odilia grew up helping her.  Her desire for self-improvement led her to study at SENA, the National Learning Service and to complete a course in Commercial Direction.  To put everything she\u2019d learned into practice, she opened her first sewing shop with her cousin at her aunt\u2019s house and strengthened her skills there and gained much experience and a good clientele to such an extent that she was able to relocate to a more comfortable, strategic place.  \r\n\r\nShe worked in this shop with her cousin for two years but eventually moved to a different city and Odilia started anew to run her business by herself.  She did this for five years and her micro business grew, she became more technologically adept and she perfected her skills.\r\n\r\nWhen she formed her own family and had her daughter, she concentrated on her for the next five years and when she was ready to return to work again she retook her art working in various workshops as an employee.  There she learned how to make party dresses, wedding gowns and haute couture in general. This was how when she was ready again to start a business of her own, her sister-in-law helped her because she took out a loan in her name to buy her first machines and with that she was able to acquire regular customers to be able to pay for this purchase and with profits is exactly what she did.\r\n\r\nHer shop currently has two plain machines, one overlock machine and one family machine.  She has approximately 150 customers and she sells on credit and for cash.  To accept a contract she asks for a 50% down payment and the remainder is paid upon delivery.  She pays cash for her supplies in nearby stores.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her 15 year old daughter who helps her very much in the business because her creativity is bottomless and Odilia takes advantage of it because she is genius when it comes to clothing design, something that she\u2019s passionate about.  Odilia is very proud of her daughter and she works every day to provide her with more opportunities to be successful at whatever she likes which is precisely designing the clothing line.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy an industrial blind stitch machine to better finish the articles of clothing, a steam iron and bolts of fabric to make women\u2019s dresses and have stock available to display for Mother\u2019s Day, one of the seasons of highest commercial movement when Odilia\u2019s profits usually increase helping her to reach her

In his time spent working in the nursery, he learned how to grow and cultivate plants, and when he was ready to tackle the trade on his own, he started by planting seeds and growing plants in the patio of his home.

Her son goes to school. Temur works as a night watchman at a local private company. Elene leads the family's agricultural business. They have a small vineyard, and Temur sells grapes in the village. The family's total average monthly income is 200 Georgian laris (GEL). According to Credo estimates, the family falls in the subsistence-poor category.\r\n\r\nElene requested credit to start up a new agricultural business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing credit to start-ups and re-startups with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. Elene will use her loan to purchase and raise 15-17 calves, who will be placed in an old cattle shed in her yard. After half a year, she will sell the grown calves for a higher price and get the profit. For the first 2 cycles of her new business, Elene will reinvest most of the profit to increase her turnover. This will enable the family to increase their income and thereby combat poverty. In addition, in the future, the family will have enough income to access the regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market in case of need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1097595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Napareuli","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-05-18T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-17T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":580}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358390,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394585,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449423,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209629,"comment":null},{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440396,"comment":null},{"amount":1980,"local_amount":1980,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1980,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045458,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T22:11:43Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":427184,"name":"Malan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malan is a 24-year-old single man in the business of selling spare car parts.

The house is located in the District of Pura Pura in the city of La Paz.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy more jewelry such as rings, earrings, necklaces, charms, and other items so that she can sell them later and increase her income.  Sintya dreams of improving her quality of life and providing more comfort and security for her daughter.  This is the first time she has worked with IMPRO and Kiva.

With it she will purchase toiletries and personal grooming products, cosmetics, colognes and other merchandise, given that Mothers' Day is coming up, a time in which businesses get a breath of fresh air if they have enough inventory to be able to impact their clients.
