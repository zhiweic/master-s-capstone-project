For social reasons, Kassipin did not have the chance to continue her primary education. For this reason, she became interested in income-generating activities with her mother at a young age. After attempting several businesses without success, she finally started her current business of buying and selling various merchandise.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her customers' demand and expand her business, Kassipin decided seven years ago to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. With her solidarity loans (i.e. loans as part of a group) all fully repaid, Kassipin is currently on her sixth individual loan, with her prior loans repaid in full. With this loan, Kassipin plans to purchase an assortment of utensils and cups from Ghana and Togo. She sells her merchandise from her home for cash or on credit to a clientele composed mainly of women.\r\n\r\nKassipin hopes to earn an average monthly income of 75,000 FCFA.

She is married and has a son. They live together in a house that she owns.\r\n\r\nSonia has worked in agriculture for 10 years, cultivating different crops such as cacao and organic coffee in a plot of agricultural land that covers 2 hectares. She bought the land with the help of her husband who works as a mason. \r\n\r\nAs a young girl she lived with her parents who also worked in agriculture. This gave her the chance to learn how to produce and maintain different plantations in good condition as a way to earn an income to benefit her family. She usually works with the help of day labourers, whom she contracts for group tasks such as weeding and harvesting. Her husband also helps her when he is not working on a construction job. To improve the quality of her harvests she uses organic fertilizer. One of her dreams is to buy a vehicle to easily transport her harvests from the fields to the place where she sells them.\r\n\r\nThis it is her first loan with Kiva. She is very thankful for the financial support that she is receiving. It will allow her to move forward. On this occasion she is requesting 3000 Peruvian Soles to acquire a new plot of land to cultivate organic cacao in order to increase her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1368812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a plot of land for agriculture.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":453.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":473.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":493.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":508.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":528.07},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":543.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.27,"local_amount":453.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":454.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975842,"comment":null},{"amount":173.59,"local_amount":473.43,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":474.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997110,"comment":null},{"amount":180.77,"local_amount":493.02,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":494.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864580,"comment":null},{"amount":187.42,"local_amount":511.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":512.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352948,"comment":null},{"amount":194.27,"local_amount":529.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":531.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904715,"comment":null},{"amount":197.68,"local_amount":539.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":540.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090723,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T23:50:29Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:03:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570691,"name":"Bayarkhurel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bayarkhurel, 38 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.

She was born in a rural area that has good conditions for animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops.  Norchon's family was not financially well-off, and she had helped her parents with animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops since childhood.  Norchon survived a lot of difficulties in life because she lived in a poor family.  After finishing school, Norchon got married, but then got divorced four years later and returned to her parents' home with two sons.  Norchon's younger brother and his family lived with her.  Soon, the sons grew up and started to help their mother and uncle.  They were mainly involved in animal husbandry, i.e. bought livestock from a market at low prices, fattened it for a set period of time and resold it at a high price.  Due to bad weather and climate, their business did not produce positive results.  Then, Norchon sent her oldest son to Russia for work.  Norchon has to marry off both of her sons, but first, she needs set up her house for her family.

This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend on cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a direct-selling business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarites hopes to expand her business and dreams that her grandchildren will finish their studies.

He will use part of the loan to buy medicines and other products, for his pharmacy inventory. He will use another part of the loan to buy grocery items to resell at his variety store. The more items displayed at the stores, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. His profits from his businesses will definitely help him to meet the family's daily needs. He looks forward to this financial increase with happiness and thankfulness in his heart.\r\n\r\nHonesto dreams that his children will finish their studies and hopes that his businesses will continue. He meets with his co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of his work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Normahmad is a happy and responsible 35 year-old man.  He is married and has four children.  They live in harmony and happiness.  Their living conditions are not very favorable because they live in a mountainous area, but Normahmad tries to provide his children with all of the necessities.  He is involved in his own business in order to have a consistent income in the family.  He has six heads of small livestock.  His wife, Nilufar, helps him with this business.  She is a good helper to her husband and a caring mother to her children.  Also, Normahmad is involved in growing agricultural crops.  Last year, he got a harvest and a decent profit as an additional income.  But because animal husbandry yields his main income, Normahmad wants to expand this business and increase his income to satisfy his family's needs.  This is why he came to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy several heads of livestock for subsequent resale.  He relies on the support very much and thanks Arvand in advance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1369827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-13T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-13T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Normahmad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":472.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":483.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":494.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":505.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":517.07},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":527.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":472.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":494.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":517.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":527.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-13T18:09:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570721,"name":"Felicisima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Felicisima.

","en":"Saodatkhon is a resident of Qubadiyon, Tajikistan.  She is 24 years old, married and has two daughters.  Saodatkhon is a caring mother and a hardworking person.  She works in agriculture.  Now, she wants to start her own business to increase her family's income so that her children won't want for anything.  She is planning to sell children's clothing and has already obtained space (3x5 meters) from which to do so at a local market.  Saodatkhon has savings from the sale of her crops and her husband's income.  For the rest of the money needed, she is asking for a loan.

He lives with Bertha, his wife of 20 years. Together they have three young children whom they care for in the house he inherited from his parents 20 years ago. When he was a boy, he learned to farm and raise animals. From there, he decided to study agriculture and livestock at a recognized university. His studies were paid for thanks to his work because when he was 16 he started planting all types of crops, such as rice, beets, carrots, cauliflower, artichokes, and broccoli; he specializes in this. He sells the harvest at the city market.\r\n\r\nBut the work he loves most is raising guinea pigs. He has 500 of them. His secret is maintaining their positions; he separates them according to their age and relationships. Every three months, the number of animals grows. The guinea pig feed is mostly alfalfa, which Jesus plants; this is because alfalfa has high nutritional value. People know him, and his customers are constantly ordering guinea pigs to sell or eat.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. She also has a direct selling business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorma dreams to expand her business and hopes that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1369284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase

He has more than 10 years experience in agriculture but he still doesn\u2019t have his own agricultural land. His main goal during this time has been to keep his family in good conditions and provide a good education to his children. This is why, during his free time, he works as a porter, carrying bags of potatoes to different trucks for transport to the markets in the interior of the country. He also works on several different plots of cropland, which is how he learns new cultivation techniques for his potato, corn, and pea crops. He sells them at the wholesale market in the nearest city. This is his fifth loan with Kiva and he feels very grateful for the financial support he has received so that he could continue working.

She is married to Roque, and they live alone in their house made of rustic materials, since their only daughter works independently in a nearby city. In spite of the fact that the farm work is very hard, she does not back down, but on the contrary, she thinks of her goals and exerts herself to do things well. She has worked in agriculture for 20 years. She likes to plant peas and gladiolus flowers for the great economic benefits that they offer her, since they are very sought after in her region.

Mar\u00eda has been farming since a very early age as her family has a tradition of working the land and her parents taught her how to clean the land and plant the crops.

She never had a chance to attend school, which is why she's been relying on trade since her youngest age.\r\n\r\nShe's been preparing and selling \"Soumbala\" (a condiment made out of beans, widely-used in West Africa). She's very much in demand from her clientele, and gets important orders from many different parts of Mali. Her business is therefore very promising.\r\n\r\nTo increase her working capital in order to meet customer demand and expand her business, she joined Kiva' partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, eight years ago. She already benefited from group loans (solidarity loans) and is now seeking her sixth personal loan. Previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy fifteen 100 kg sacks of soy from cereals warehouses in Koutiala. She transforms the soy into \"Soumbala\" that she sells in Koutiala, Bamako and Kayes, for cash and often on credit, to a clientele comprising mostly women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she counts on a monthly profit of XOF 100'000 (ca US$ 200) that she intends to use to repay the loan and help improve her family's standard of living. She will reinvest the remainder in her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":615,"image":{"id":1370048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He lives in the small village of Bolnisi District with his wife and parents. \r\n\r\nAzhdar has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from their agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land, where haricot and wheat are grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAzhdar requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Azhdar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

They have been friends ever since they met in Lebanon. They decided to form the Maya group and contact Al Majmoua because they are in dire need of financial assistance and a group loan is their last hope. \r\n\r\nSionida is the leader and featured member of this group, standing on the far right of the picture. She is a 47 year-old married mother of one child. Her husband and child are still living in the Philippine, but her husband is currently unemployed. Thus, she is the only financial provider of the family, although she lives thousands of kilometers away. She decided to join the Maya group in order to acquire the group loan with the support of her friends, and send it off to her family.\r\n\r\nJennifer is  a 25 year-old young lady who is still single, standing on the far left of the picture. Her parents are retired which means she participates greatly in the family income. She decided to join the group and acquire a loan because her mother is in the hospital and has to pay the hospitalization fees.\r\n\r\nArlyn is a 36 year-old single woman, standing second to the left of the picture.

Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,253,200 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Yarjah has already received and successfully repaid four loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional drugs and cosmetics. He hopes that this loan can increase the stock and improve his profit. In the future, Yarjah plans to open another outlet in the center of town. He thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":705,"image":{"id":1368872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay for patent drugs and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2013-06-14T14:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-14T14:10:17Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yarjah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390494645,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399742822,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410012987,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776043,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429425751,"comment":null},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":508631.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439644281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-14T13:09:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571006,"name":"Nelly Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Nelly habita en el municipio de Ticuantepe, su mayor sue\u00f1o es mejorar sus condiciones de vida, junto a su esposo lucha dia a dia para lograr sus objetivos, desde mas de 10 a\u00f1os ella tiene su propio negocio es due\u00f1a de Una Libreria ubicada en el centro del municipio  negocio que le va muy bien, su esposo la apoya con los gastos del hogar ya que trabaja como consultor independiente, actualmete requiere de capital para invertir en su negocio ya que se aproximan los meses en que  mas vende y quiere aprovechar para que sus ingresos mejoren un poco, compra: Libros, Cuadernos, Mapas, Lapices, Cartulinas, Figuras etc. Agradece el apoyo que Afodenic y Fondos le estan brindando.","en":"Nelly lives in the town of Ticuantepe.

She has three additional dependents living with her, because she takes care of them while they attend school in the city. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Mariama established her 'gara' clothing (locally dyed clothing) business. She began her business because she wanted to be self-employed in order to have a dependable means of earning income and to help her husband provide livelihood for their children. She made good profits for the upkeep of her family, and that is why she loves this type of business. \r\n\r\nWorking six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 900,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Mariama requires a loan in order to buy one bale of brilliant materials to produce different types of gara cloth, including clothing, bedding, and curtains. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL.\r\n\r\nMariama used the proceeds from her last loan to pay school fees for her children and provide livelihood for her family. Mariama has yet to open the big shop she is planning to open.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mariama plans to open a big shop and continue to sponsor her children as they go through their education smoothly. Competition is high, but she offers the best and latest fashions, giving her an edge over her competitors. She supplies customers in Freetown and Makeni Town, offering the latest patterns and designs to suit her customers' needs.

is a person who is conscientious and hardworking, and she dreams of better living conditions. She is 25 years old. She is married and has three children, aged four, two, and one. She lives in a village and therefore has good conditions for raising livestock. She has been working with livestock for more than ten years. She mainly fattens small-horned livestock.

For the last 3 years she has lived in her in-laws' house with her husband Manuel and their 3 children who she looks after. Her life revolves around working constantly and her children's education. \r\n\r\nShe says her husband works in a mine so they have economic stability. But since he only comes back from work after 20 days away, Fidela has occasional expenses which crop up, so she came up with the idea of opening a business.

Her husband has been making and selling furniture for four years, and besides this job, he also makes Mongolian traditional gers. The house they live in is made with balks, and over the years, the house quality has deteriorated due to snow and rain. So she is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cements, planks, fiberglass and foam. Using those materials, they want to encase balk walls with bricks and insulate them with fiberglass. As a result, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, release less pollutants and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

is a Kubo Financiero client, this is her story.\n\n\"My name is Jennifer, and I am 30 years old.  I completed my studies at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) and became a dentist in 2012.  After finishing school, I opened a dental clinic in my neighborhood.  I will use this loan to buy x ray equipment.  The equipment costs about $2,050 US, but I will complement the loan with some savings that I have.  With the new equipment, I will be able to generate additional income because I currently have to send my clients to other places to make their radiographies.\n\nI would like to share with you that I am married to Jesus, who works as a baker.

As the head of the family, Ashurali aims to increase the family's income by starting a new business. He has chosen to go into beekeeping. His home and plot of land are located in a distant area, where there are no industrial enterprises, farmland or apiaries, which makes it a very good place to raise bees.
