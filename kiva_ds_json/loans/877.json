Her husband is a merchant.\r\n<p>\r\nMiriam is an excellent homemaker who earns her own income so that she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She sells Avon and Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women's accessories).  Miriam also sells clothing through catalogs.  Her sales are conducted by going door-to-door.  She takes advantage of her free time and moments when she is not busy in order to make a sale.  Miriam extends credit and collects payments on a weekly basis.  She says that she enjoys selling and has done very well in the four years she has been in business.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy perfumes, trinkets, cosmetics, cr\u00e8mes, and all types of clothing.

always liked antiques, but never considered turning his hobby of collecting and trading antiques into a career. He started out selling items from his home \u2013 in between shift work at his day job. But about a year ago, he opened his San Juan, Texas business, C. Trading Post, where he sells and trades almost anything, but tries to stick with antiques. Since then, his business has expanded and necessitated this loan.\n\nWhen Apolinar decided to move his business from home to a store, he was informed by the San Juan Economic Development Corporation about Accion Texas Inc., which eventually led to his visiting an Accion office to apply for a business loan. There are no other trading posts in his hometown, which helps Apolinar gain customers and leaves him with a hand up on future competition. The main idea of opening this business was to ensure he had a job, but now he has a career he loves. \n\nApolinar said he wants to create an enjoyable shopping experience. The loan will therefore fund start-up costs including interior and exterior d\u00e9cor, lining the building with insulation, and repairing the floor. Currently, he works alone, but as his business expands, Apolinar plans to employ another person.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2789.89,"image":{"id":1104038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is twenty-nine-year-old very kind and friendly young man. He is single and lives with his parents. He has raised livestock for the last five years. He sells them for meat, which is very popular among local people. Many popular dishes like dolma and pilov are made of meat. People consider it very healthy and digestible.\r\n\r\nHicran usually buys calves, raises and fattens them and sells them for profitable price. His monthly income is 100 AZN and this is the only financial income in his family. Keeping a family and covering any children's needs will be a very hard job.

is Adoracion. She is 60 years old and a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a mother of 2 children, one working, the other staying at home. Together with her children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nAdoracion operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, Php5 worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. Adoracion earns income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She also does direct selling business -- she sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customers order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. She earns a minimum of PHP17,500 in net sales a week.\n\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP50,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory and will also use it to buy products for the direct-selling business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\n\nAdoracion hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1114742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

It currently has 16 members.  Each one has developed a business activity with the intention of having better living conditions.  This group is from the community of Cerro Mojarra La Capilla, which is located on the shore of a large lake.  Most of the people are fishermen or fishmongers who sell \"mojarra\" (a fish similar to tilapia).  \n\nMargarita is 52 years old and married to Navor, a vendor.  They have four children who are students.  Three years ago, Margarita opened a small grocery store along the main street in her community in hopes of generating income to provide her children with an education and a better life.  She opens her business very early and says she likes having it well-stocked because her customers can always find what they are looking for and return to buy more.  In addition, it should be noted that Margarita's store is located on the edge of the road, so she is able to sell to a few more people who are also coming to buy fish in her community.  Margarita has plans to invest her loan in the purchase of cooking oil, canned foods, candy, detergent, soap, juices, soft drinks, beans, rice, sugar, cheese, cream, milk, chili peppers, and other products to sell.

De acuerdo con sus propias palabras, las caracter\u00edsticas que debe tener una persona para hacer el tipo de trabajo que desempe\u00f1a es ser amable con los clientes, ser responsable para no dejar trabajo pendiente y honesto para reconocer cuando se equivoca y cuando el trabajo no es de la mejor calidad en lugar de decir que la refacci\u00f3n no tiene la suficiente calidad.

They are all named Manuel, and so this is why they decided to name their group \"The 3 Manuel.\"  \r\n\r\nJuan Manuel, better known by the nickname \"Negro,\" has a business selling auto parts, and he also has a mechanic's workshop in his house.  However, he will soon move the workshop to another location, because there is not a lot of space in his house.  He started his business thanks to his uncle Luis, who set up his mechanic's workshop and initially bought the tools.  Later, he invited Juan Manuel to work with him.  Back then, Juan Manuel  didn't know anything about mechanics, but with the support of his uncle he learned everything he needed to know, and now he enjoys this activity very much.  One challenge for him is that he wants to improve his business.  What \"Negro\" likes most is to repair motors, while what he finds most difficult is to deal with the competition.  Juan Manuel knows that the other mechanics charge less to repair cars, and this makes him lose customers.  According to his own words, the characteristics that a person must have to do this type of work are: they must be friendly with the customers, they must be responsible to not leave unfinished work, and they must be honest and recognize when they make a mistake and when the work is not of the best quality, instead of saying that the part is not of sufficient quality.   Juan Manuel is considered to be a special person because of his desire to excel in his work so that he can accomplish his dreams.  One of these is to have a bigger mechanic's workshop that is equipped with all of the tools and auto parts needed to provide better service.  \"Negro\" is requesting a loan to buy more automotive parts. \r\n\r\n The other members of the group are: Juan Manuel: who provides mechanic's services, and Jose Manuel, who also provide mechanic's services. \r\n\r\n They thank the Vision Fund for helping all of the hardworking men who want to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1110469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

the age of 29, Owen is the proud owner of a small mobile money transfer business in the fishing and rice-growing town of Senanga. He is the first born in his family and has four siblings who all go to school.\n\nOwen is a person who has grown in business. Before he had his own mobile money transfer shop, Owen worked for his father. He says working for his father taught him how to give customers the best possible service and how to develop friendships, both of which he says are important to making his business work. When Owen is not at his shop he is often found at church where he is a part-time pastor.\n\nOwen\u2019s business is located very close to the harbor. He says most of his customers are fishermen and rice growers who normally use his service to send and receive money for business purposes and for their children\u2019s school fees among other things.  He is convinced that his customers love his business because it is convenient to use and cheaper than other money transfer services.\n\nWhen asked what challenges he faces in his business, he cites low working capital as the major one. This, he says, is particularly a challenge when he has a lot of people who want to transact with him. However he is hopeful that once he gets a Kiva loan, he will be able to have more money in his business and be able to do more transactions. This will bring him a lot of joy because it will mean never having to ask another customer to wait to be served.\n\nBeing the first born in his family, Owen wants to lead as a role model for his younger siblings by succeeding at his business, and earn profits which he can use to send them to school.\n\nIn the video, a representative from Mobile Transactions is interviewing Owen.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4975,"image":{"id":1106879,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2601,"youtubeId":"t9EOmvKBymo","title":"Kiva Borrower Owen

He has a service transporting passengers via motorbike. Omar tells us that before he had the motorbike he had a car, with which he worked as a taxi driver, but he was in an accident. Thanks to God, he was not seriously injured. He tells us that he went a period of time without working until he bought the new vehicle. It has been a year since he started working in this way, and up to now it is going very well for him. Omar tells us that he started to work when he was very young, since he has always liked to contribute support to his household. He starts his route at 8 in the morning until 8 at night, charging a fare of $0.50 on his route. He tells us that drivers can't charge more, since they compete with the bus service and it costs $0.25. The majority of his customers are people who are going far out where the buses don't go, and also those who are carrying purchases, and he makes the transport easier for them. In his work his biggest problems are the streets on his route, since they are not paved and are thus in poor condition, causing damage to his motorbike. With the loan, Omar will perform maintenance on his motor taxi, since it needs it, and he will fix up his grandparents' house.

This will be her fifth time to receive a loan.  She has been quite successful in the past with her farming activities due to high demand for the products. \r\n \r\nMary plans to use her loan to buy and sell fried fish and plantains and pepper soup meat.  She will also use part of her loan to carry out crop cultivation. Part of her profits from this loan will be used to take care of her children, buy necessities for the family, give them good medication whenever they are sick, and part will plough back into the farm. This activity will ease the problem of food shortages in the

She's 58 years old and runs a grocery store in her house. She's married to Panfilo, who's a fisherman. Her children are adults and lead independent lives. She started the grocery store nine years ago, with help from her husband, who provided her working capital. After that, she requested her first loan, which she used to stock up. Currently, her store is well-stocked, and she gets occasional help from her youngest daughter. In her grocery store she sells rice, sugar, olive oil, salt, provisions, tuna, cleaning producs, etc. She earns a profit margin of 15 to 20%, depending on the merchandise. She opens Monday through Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Luisa tells us that her biggest concern is illness, since because of her age she's prone to suffer from them, but apart from that she doesn't have major problems. With the loan she hopes to purchase goods for selling in the store, in the hopes of getting enough capital to buy a fishing

She decided to situate her business here as trucks, buses and vehicles pass by daily. It is easy to sell the drivers food, flavored water and soda. Mrs. Rosa rises daily and buys supplies, such as fresh beans, in the supply center of the community. She buys the drinks from a supplier that comes twice a week. At eight in the morning she begins to cook her stews in order to sell them for lunches or mealtime. She says that she likes her work a lot as she gets to know people from all parts of the country that pass by here on their travels.

She is 56 years old and is a school teacher. Seeking an additional source of income for her family back in 2000, Bubaim set up her business of producing national handmade felt carpets (shyrdak) with 5,000 som (KGS). Having created their own group and set up the production by means of joint efforts in material purchasing and work from home, the Group's monthly income from the sale of their products amounts to 20,000 som (KGS).\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Bubaim turned to the organization Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase necessary carpet fibers and materials. Bubaim and the Group are planning on investing the earnings from the loan into further business expansion and purchase a sewing machine to make Kyrgyz national hats

When she has free time, Beatriz likes to read and make one of her favorite dishes \"Wheat and Steak\".

Some time ago, they purchased land on which they built the wooden house where they presently live.\r\n\r\nVicenta makes a living selling food items (rice, sugar, vegetables, drinks, preserves, candy, meat, etc). She has operated a small grocery store out of her house for the past 9 years, and her children (and sometimes her husband) help her attend to clients at the store. She likes the fact that this job gives her the flexibility to spend time with her kids and clients at the same time. What she doesn't like, however, is when her merchandise and stock are low and she cannot meet the needs of her customers. For this reason, she is requesting a loan which she plans to invest in stocking her business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support she has received, and promises to make all payments on time. She is also happy to be a member of her local community bank, as her fellow members are kind and responsible people. She hopes this loan will help her to stock her business well so that she can meet her clients' needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1115488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase products to stock her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":194.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":210.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":218.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":227.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":231.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.03,"local_amount":338.74,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":340.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401882,"comment":null},{"amount":68.38,"local_amount":182.35,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451815,"comment":null},{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":190.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":191.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446997,"comment":null},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":194.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":195.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052905,"comment":null},{"amount":77.13,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":206.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187918,"comment":null},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":210.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":211.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571964,"comment":null},{"amount":81.85,"local_amount":218.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":219.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121736,"comment":null},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":227.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867681,"comment":null},{"amount":86.74,"local_amount":231.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":232.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576647,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T21:44:45Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":436361,"name":"Immaculate","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Immaculate is married with six children.

En otras ocasiones labora como jornalera en las parcelas de sus vecinos, es as\u00ed como llega a ganar lo suficiente para el sustento de sus hijos.  \nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su actividad es conversar con sus vecinos mientras realizan las cosechas o cuando sacan la maleza. Sin embargo, lo que le preocupa es que tiene que dejar a sus hijos solos mientras trabaja. Su objetivo a futuro es abrir una tienda de abarrotes para estar en casa con sus hijos. Por tal motivo, se esmera en seguir ejerciendo su labor para que las ganancias crezcan y logre su anhelo. \n\nVictoria se siente muy contenta por la oportunidad de cr\u00e9dito y el apoyo de esta microfinanciera. Por lo que promete ser puntual en sus cuotas de pago. Asimismo, agradece a su banco comunal por permitirles participar en el grupo.\nCon los 1,500 nuevos soles de este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 comprar lo que necesita para realizar el mantenimiento de sus plantas (abono y fertilizantes). ","en":"Victoria is a very hard working woman who is responsible for taking care of all five of her children after she and her husband separated two years ago. She and her children live in her father's house, which she inherited when she was single.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she gets up very early to make breakfast for her kids, and then she goes out to tend her coffee plants and lands. She sometimes works as a day laborer on her neighbors' lands in order to make a living and provide for her children.\r\n\r\nHer favorite aspect of her job is chatting with her neighbors while they are harvesting or tending crops, or when they are pulling weeds on their land. What worries her, however, is that she has to leave her children alone while she works hard all day to provide for them. Her goal for the future is to open a general store out of her home so that she can be with her children and work at the same time.

They live in a house built with rustic materials, which they bought twenty years ago. \r\n\r\nVilma has worked selling groceries for ten years, and purchases her products in the city of San Francisco, located one hour away from her community.

Her greatest hope is for her children to become professionals, which is why she and her husband put a lot of effort into their work.

In spite of this, Vilma needs a loan in order to improve what she has achieved so far, by further stocking her store. \r\n\r\nThat is why she is very happy to receive support from this microfinancing institution, because she feels confident that her business will move forward. She also enjoys being a part of her communal bank because she works with committed people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2,000 nuevos soles from this loan to stock up on merchandise to fill her store with rice, sugar, drinks, vegetables, etc. "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1115501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase products to stock her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":190.78},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":194.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":210.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":218.26},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":227.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":231.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.05,"local_amount":162.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":163.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401884,"comment":null},{"amount":65.98,"local_amount":175.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":176.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456158,"comment":null},{"amount":68.38,"local_amount":182.35,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451817,"comment":null},{"amount":71.54,"local_amount":190.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":191.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446999,"comment":null},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":194.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":195.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052907,"comment":null},{"amount":77.13,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":206.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187920,"comment":null},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":210.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":211.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571965,"comment":null},{"amount":81.85,"local_amount":218.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":219.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121738,"comment":null},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":227.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867683,"comment":null},{"amount":86.74,"local_amount":231.32,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":232.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576649,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-12T16:43:50Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":436667,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is a 28 year old gentleman married with 2 children living in Kagadi, Uganda.

Cutuglagua is one of the parishes with the highest population growth in Pichincha province. It is still developing in order to offer a better quality of life to all its inhabitants, who arrive from provinces all over Ecuador. Many areas in the parish don't have basic services such as water, electricity, sewer, and garbage collection. \r\n\r\nFor three years now, Yolanda has been working very hard under these living conditions in order to provide for her young daughter, because being a single mother, she doesn't get support from her child's father. She sells mangoes on the street, with sugar, cinnamon, or salt. Yolanda decided to set up her business on the street because there is a lot of demand for her product in the city, especially among school children.\r\n\r\nOne of the obstacles Yolanda has had to overcome was a lack of support when she was starting her business, as well as the permits required in order to move around freely and offer her product. Her days are hard and long, but every one of them has its reward, when after eight long hours of work she is able to come home to her daughter Katerine and share beautiful moments of mother-daughter quality time.\r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to be able to increase her amount of raw materials, so that she can expand her business to the surrounding areas of Machachi. Her dream is to be able to save up and buy a house where she can live with all the comforts she needs to give her daughter a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1115851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase mangoes and fruit for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-12T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":98.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.66,"local_amount":79.08,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092752,"comment":null},{"amount":82.49,"local_amount":81.89,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":82.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334556,"comment":null},{"amount":83.46,"local_amount":82.86,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390480,"comment":null},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":84.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":85.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149470,"comment":null},{"amount":87.2,"local_amount":86.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382595,"comment":null},{"amount":88.42,"local_amount":87.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":88.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989682,"comment":null},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":89.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":90.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126094,"comment":null},{"amount":91.89,"local_amount":91.22,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516695,"comment":null},{"amount":93.67,"local_amount":92.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":93.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068560,"comment":null},{"amount":292.63,"local_amount":290.51,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T00:56:28Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:26:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":436860,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Huanca De Cusco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece  al banco comunal SE\u00d1OR DE HUANCA DE CUSCO;

After the separation from her husband she had to get ahead in life alone, and her biggest desire was to have her own business and to be able to be together with her children.  Then she decided to make a living by selling fuel.  She began working as a day-laborer on the farms, and with those earnings she managed to implement her business three years ago.  It is doing very well since it is the only one that sells fuel in her community.  Nevertheless, the problems she sometimes has occur when she raises the price of gasoline or oil.  Her main desire is to build a house with solid material (brick and cement) and to establish her gas station in it.  \r\n\r\nRegina is grateful for the opportunity she has with this loan to continue with her goals.
