She is married and has adult children. Her husband works as a salesman at a dealership. In order to provide the family with all the necessities, 17 years ago she started a business buying and selling fabric. She sells her goods at the local market. Nafisa tries to obtain and sell high-quality goods. She worries about the health of women who buy fabric and sew dresses themselves, so she advises her clients to buy fabric made of cotton. Nafisa manages the business herself. She has already been credited 16 times by our organization and has a good credit record. She is asking for a loan of 10,000 TJS to buy fabric for the new season.

She is married and raising two children.  She has not had a source of income for many years.  Because her husband has a small salary, they are not able to provide their children with all of the necessities.  The children demand more comforts year-after-year because they develop together with the developing world.  Gulchehra decided to organize a business of buying and selling dried fruits because dried fruits are in high demand at a local market.  She searched for help for a long time and finally learned about the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women.

He lives with his parents. His mother is 60 years old and works at the local hospital as a nurse. Badri requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nFamily runs an agricultural business. In, particular they own a plot of agricultural land and have two milk cows. Badri and his father are cultivating the land seasonally. They saw on the land different kinds of vegetables. Badri\u2019s mother milks the cows every day and produces fresh dairy products. As the family has been in this business for a long time, they have loyal customers who always prefer their products since they are high quality and sold at affordable prices. Besides Badri has a cafeteria in the center of Zestaponi district. \r\nBadri requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. Badri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Badri will purchase a coffee pouring machine, which will be located inside his cafeteria. Badri is very hardworking man.

is 29 years old. He lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with his wife, two sons and parents, who are provided with a retirement pension. George requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.7 hectare plot of land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. Besides they have 6 milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. They sell the harvested products with dairy products at local markets at a good price. It is hardly enough on food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested loan from Credo to start-up family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit George will begin trade with livestock. He plans to purchase the livestock at wholesale prices and then resell at higher price. This will increase the income of his family. With increased income, he will be able to expand the business in future. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":680.5,"image":{"id":1356882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to begin trade with the livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Korbouli","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-23T23:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-22T23:10:15Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":142.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":163.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":168.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":172.37},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":177.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":186.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":191.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.23,"local_amount":142.77,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":145.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749748,"comment":null},{"amount":92.68,"local_amount":148.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":151.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613655,"comment":null},{"amount":94.17,"local_amount":150.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":153.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857369,"comment":null},{"amount":96.74,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":157.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134017,"comment":null},{"amount":100.14,"local_amount":160.22,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":163.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107606,"comment":null},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":163.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":166.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255150,"comment":null},{"amount":105.46,"local_amount":168.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":171.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019289,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T20:00:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":563134,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy is 53 years old, married, and a mother of three children.

Her husband is employed at the Ministry of Education who earns small salary, which is barely enough to cover the family's needs.\r\nBoshra wants to improve her house's kitchen condition, so she is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing and installing marble stone shelves to the kitchen.\r\nThis will make Boshra's movement in the kitchen more easier and fullfill her needs , which will improve her family's living condition positively.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Taking this loan will offer to Yehia comfortable furniture so he can enjoy living in his house with his coming wife.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Taking this loan will offer to Mohammad new mobile phone, so he will be in contact with his family and his clients, which will improve his living condition.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He makes the thread himself and sells it in the market.\r\n\r\nShakeela is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband. He will use the loan to increase his supply of threads so he can respond quickly to his customer's needs. He plans to expand his business with the additional income he earns. Shakeela hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business. She is thankful to Kiva and BRAC
