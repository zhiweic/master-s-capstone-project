He is married to Josephine, a housewife and they have children. Together, they manage their household while operating a business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFreddie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops, then, stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, like factories and others of the like. \r\n\r\nFreddie's regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 (Philippine Pesos) in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Freddie is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan on his current revolving fund, used to buy trash from collectors. \r\n\r\nFreddie dreams of expanding his business and having another branch.

At present she would like to expand her business and buy new goods for her store, such as soap, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies and other household goods, because such items are in demand and sell out quickly. She could have easily restocked her merchandise but lacks sufficient funds. Mavjigul is requesting a loan to stock up on merchandise. She would really like to keep her existing customers happy as well as attract new ones.

His oldest daughter is married.  His youngest son is still very small.  His other children (three sons and three daughters) go to school and help their parents around the house.  Huseyn has been raising poultry for six years, and this activity is the only source of income for his family.\n\nHuseyn, age 46, raises turkeys and chickens.  He has been fascinated with big birds from an early age.  You can see two of his birds in the photo, next to him. \n\nHuseyn does an excellent job and seems to be able to understand his birds, which is not the case of all experienced poultry farmers.

He has a grown-up son, who lives in the city of Tarma to study. He has his own home, which is located in a rural area. More than 15 years ago, Eler began in the blacksmith\u2019s trade. In an environment he set up in his home, he has various machines that allow him to build doors, windows, tables, and other things from metal.

Thanks to this work, he managed to give his son an education. On the busiest days he contracts day labourers, whom he pays for their services; otherwise he would not be able to finish his work. He likes his work, so he needs your help to acquire more material.

This will be their sixth group loan.\r\n\r\nNiagale is the president of the group and is well-known and much appreciated in Tiele, for the delicious, high-quality food that she prepares.   She intends to use this loan to buy ingredients (onions, cabbage), meat and rice for her catering business.  She buys her supplies in Bamako and locally, from wholesalers, and sells her meals in Tiele through retail, cash and credit sales to both men and women.

In order to improve his family's budget, he is planning to start a new parallel business in feeding and selling cattle.  He will keep animals at home, on a livestock yard.

She has a secondary education and has been involved in sewing for 15 years.  She makes and sells national goods, clothing and dowry for brides.  She has a lot of work experience in this business.  Nazilkan gained sufficient experience and clients in this business.  Nazilkan had her own small, national-dress sewing factory at the central market, which provided 15 jobs for people.  The business was running well, but a fire happened inside the factory on January 28, 2013.  It was impossible to put the fire out in time, and the business burned down completely, including the factory itself, equipment, materials, fabrics and accessories.  Luckily, none of the people were hurt.  Nazilkan did not give up in this difficult situation.  She strongly got through this and then, putting all of her efforts together, started to work hard to restore her business.  The multi-year experience, strong character and relatives helped Nazilkan to get back on her feet.  Eight months have passed since the fire, and Nazilkan was able to install a new a container, where 4 seamstresses work.  The business is gradually improving, and Nazilkan dreams to further develop and strengthen her business.  Nazilkan needs money to purchase fabrics for sewing national clothing and increase her goods turnover.

He has been working in construction, specializing in painting work, since nineteen years ago. He was only fifteen years old when he started this kind of work. Because he had to help his family in covering their expenses, he had to quit school during his intermediate studies.\r\n\r\nAli is working hard to improve his family\u2019s living, and his painting business isn\u2019t good enough to cover the unexpected needs that have arisen. So he thought of starting a new, extra business, which he believes will provide him with a good income throughout the whole year.

As his existing income is not enough for such a big family, Enver decided to start a new business. \r\n\r\nThe Start Up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables Enver to get a loan of $5000 for starting his business.   With the loan, he will rent a commercial space and purchase stocks of groceries to open a grocery store. He will have a chance to be involved in his own business and increase the income for his family.

He works hard on family-owned agricultural land. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only seasonal income, Lasha decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful, because of his poor living conditions. A start-up program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get loans for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 5,000 USD to sell cars. He will purchase and sell cars to generate income.

","en":"Nazira is a conscientious 39-year-old who is married and has 5 children.  For more than 10 years, she has raised livestock and grown crops, while her husband is a builder by profession.  Neither she nor her husband have a university education, and have thus always hoped that their children would go to college and earn degrees in their stead.  \r\n\r\nNazira's daughter finished secondary school this year, and has enrolled in a university.

Her parents hoped that she would continue her education and go to college; however, her family's economic situation does not allow it at this time.  Undaunted, she has set another goal for herself: to open her own sewing shop.  This line of work suits her, as she learned how to make women's clothing from her mother when she was a child.  She is a clever girl, and is confident that she has what it takes to manage her own business.  She has taken a course titled \"Attain Success\"; it was organized by an association for businesswomen, and Zulola received a certificate upon completing the course.  To help set up her business, she is requesting a loan to buy a sewing machine and various kinds of fabric.

As the family has only seasonal income, Iason decided to start selling clothes and sought credit among local financial institutions. However, his attempts were unsuccessful, because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get loans for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 900 USD. He will purchase clothes to sell with the loan.

Ernestine. She is a 29-year-old from Jui, the eastern area of Freetown. She is single with one child aged ten. For the past seven years, Ernestine has run a bar and restaurant business she established within the Jui community. She began this business because she wants to generate a permanent source of income to support her child and parent; she works at the business from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm, 7 days per week.
