","en":"Maria, 56 years old, has a business in the center of the city of Barranquilla in a predominantly commercial area.  In her store she sells sport and casual lines of shoes for women, men and children.  The business was born 35 years ago when, over a period of 22 years, she traveled to Maicao, a city on the border of the country, to buy varied merchandise that she distributed among the merchants in market stalls.  When she acquired good experience with her own effort, she bought a market stall and set up to sell in a fixed location, which is where she is currently located.  The main items that she offers are sandals, flip-flops and sports shoes that she sells for cash, from 8:30 in the morning until 6:00 in the afternoon.  Her customers are passersby and informal merchants of the area that buy from her on credit and with cash.  \r\n\r\nThe high peaks of sales in her business occur during the second half of the year, especially in the final quarter.  It is precisely in this period that her working capital becomes insufficient to respond to the high demand that her products have in her business.

There she sells packaged foods and snacks, and she also sells cosmetics, women's accessories, and perfumes, which she publicizes through special guides or catalogs, which she distributes among her customers, to whom she offers credit, so that they can easily pay for the products they want from Angela's offerings. She also sells soft drinks and beverages such as beers and carbonated beverages, which she offers principally on weekends and for cash. Her principal satisfaction is selling merchandise with special discounts to her customers. Because there are many offers that arrive in her magazine, and even though she places her orders, the working capital that she has is not sufficient to manage to invest in everything that this demand requires of her, in addition to investing in the other products that sell for cash, such as soft drinks, beverages, and snacks. This is the reason why she is turning to a Kiva loan, with which she will buy cosmetics, perfumes, women's accessories, snacks, soft drinks, and beverages, articles that have an important turnover in this second period of the year and with which she will impact her customers. For her business, she has a dream of making it prosper, with the goal of offering a quality education to her children. While she works with conscientiousness so that this can happen, she manages a 15-day turnover on accounts receivable and an average profitability on sales of 15%, indicators from which we project her business growth and we predict much success in her management."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1220867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cosmetics, perfumes, women's accessories, snacks, soft drinks, and beverages to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71955},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":73634},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75352},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":77111},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":78910},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80751},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82635},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84563},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":86537},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.39,"local_amount":144700,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":146302.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994443,"comment":null},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":74521,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75346.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130789,"comment":null},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":76244,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":77088.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519645,"comment":null},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":78016,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":78879.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071488,"comment":null},{"amount":46.89,"local_amount":83364,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84287.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497702,"comment":null},{"amount":46.98,"local_amount":83503,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84427.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527516,"comment":null},{"amount":146.05,"local_amount":259652,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":262526.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928278,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-04T15:45:54Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":487100,"name":"Inti Raymi Colca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de Emprendimiento INTI RAYMI COLCA est\u00e1 compuesta por once integrantes de los cuales nueve son mujeres y dos varones que se dedican a distintas actividades, la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

She lives with her husband, with whom she has two children who are 17 and 9 years old. They all live together on part of her mother's property, where they built the house where they currently live. She and her husband work a lot since they want to get ahead and provide their children with a good education and diet. \r\n\r\nAsunci\u00f3n's work consists of the sale of clothing and linens. She sells various garments and various styles, colors, and models of bedding to the public. Her customers are basically her friends, family, and neighbors, along with new customers who always come on referrals. Sometimes, they order things from her in advance, which she distributes the same day that she receives her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe has already been working in this field for three years. She works alone because her husband is also doing his part to earn money for their household. What Asunci\u00f3n likes about her work is that she has time to do other things as well, which gives her financial independence and frees up her time to go to other areas and places where she can win more customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Asunci\u00f3n's sixth loan with MFP.

is 41-year-old Fudia. She is single and has one child aged 15 years. She has no additional dependents, but does have two sales assistants who are paid by month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Fudia established her food and drinks business. She began her business as her own means of getting revenue. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 Le (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 6,000,000.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is 41 years old. She is a widow who takes care of five children. All of the children go to school. She has been a maize farmer for 15 years. She would like a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs. She is dedicated to supporting her children in schooling with the profits that will be obtained from the business.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is 32-year-old Kadiatu.  She is married and has two children, ages 13 and 9. In 1999, Kadiatu established her plastic wares, flasks and basket business. She began her business because she didn't want to be dependent on her husband anymore; instead, she wanted to be self-sufficient. Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,700,000 a month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

is Hawa, 39 years old.  She is married and has 4 children, aged 19, 16, 14 and 12. She has four additional dependents who live with her as younger sisters.  In 2000, Hawa established her ladies' handbags business. She began her business because her husband did not care for her and the children. Since she wants her children to be brought up well, she decided to go into business to gain her own source of revenue. Working 6 days a week and 8 hours a day, she earns about Le 800,000 a month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

They work every day to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nKatiuska's job is decorating children's parties.  She buys various dolls, decorative signs, fabric, and other accessories to create her work.  Sometimes she buys the materials herself to make everything, depending on what the customer wants, the reason for the party, and the age of the person being celebrated.\r\n\r\nShe works with the help of her sister or cousin.  Her customers come to her as referrals or because they're familiar with her work.  She has good taste for putting together attractive figures, and this is reflected in the entire environment she creates for the events she does.  She has been doing this work for a year and it's going very well for her.\r\n\r\nPreviously she sold clothing on credit, but the irresponsibility of her customers when it came time to pay put an end to her business.  It's going very well for her now.  What she likes about her job is the satisfaction she feels when she sees her customers happy about everything she can create, even in small spaces.  Also, it's a flexible job that allows her to take care of her young son.\r\n\r\nNow she wants to supply her business with fabric and chairs for the parties to offer better service and generate additional income by renting them.

district in Odisha, India. Kalahandi district is known for drought and backwardness. K.Sarojini is one of the members of this group, standing in the middle with raised hand. She is a very energetic lady with advanced thinking. She is 35 years old and lives with her husband, one son of 18 years and one daughter of 20 years who are continuing their studies. Presently, K.Sarojini is residing in a small house with her family. \r\n\r\nK.Sarojini is running a 'Tiffin' business in two places of Bhawanipatna town with the help of two push carts, together with her husband for last 20 years. She prepares Tiffin items like 'dosa' and 'idli' which are very popular in the town. To help her in the business she has engaged two workers (one male and one female). She also takes contracts for supply of Tiffin at social functions. K.Sarojini earns a monthly income of 6000 INR. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan from Mahashakti Foundation and K.Sarojini wants to purchase a freezer and a grinding machine out of this loan. This will help her to store the residue of raw materials after the end of the day to be used in the next day and prepare fresh raw materials, thereby it will save the food product losses due to lack of a good preservation facility.\r\n\r\nK.Sarojini hopes to open a quality Tiffin hotel in the heart of the town and construct a 'pucca' house for her family. The other five members of the group are Sabitri, Banita, Bisakha, Kshiti and Urmila who are running a photocopy center, an electricals shop, a cloth store, a Tiffin hotel and a fast food centre.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1218053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to

Instead of being discouraged, he saw this as an opportunity to better use his skills and follow his dream of starting his own business.\r\n\r\nRamsky Machinery is a specialty shop that purchases, reconditions and sells metal working machinery. As the sole owner of the business, Richard strives to introduce his customers to the most innovative machinery, and his biggest reward is when a customer uses new technologies and machinery to increase productivity and save money.\r\n\r\nRichard is actively working to secure more customers and is currently working a night job to supplement his income. He recently acquired a new, large client contract and hopes that this opportunity will allow him to grow his business to the point where he will be able to quit his night job and focus 100 percent of his energy on his company.\r\n\r\nRichard will use his $3,000 Kiva loan to purchase a company truck that will allow him fulfill the new contract and attract additional business. He ultimately hopes that the increased business opportunities from the truck will stabilize his income and prepare him and his wife for retirement in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1610.65,"image":{"id":1218301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machine

is 41-year-old Foday.  He is married and has two children aged 9 and 12 years old. In 2007, Foday established his Provisions and Soft Drinks business.

She has lived for some time with the man she loves. They live in her parents' home but she has her own lot in the same neighborhood where she will build her own home. She is constantly helping out with the household finances and that is why every day she works hard to have a better quality of life. Liz's work now is renting out rooms. She has set up four rooms on her lot and she rents them out daily, weekly or monthly at comfortable prices. To build these rooms she had her father's and her husband's help. They support her unconditionally. She just started this activity a month ago. Previously she sold chickens, but the demand for the product went down and that is why she decided to switch to a different type of work. Now she is in the middle of outfitting some of the rooms and is painting them so they will look better. Despite this she already has potential renters who are waiting to use the rooms. She also has alittle bit of money saved up that she wants to invest in buying a motorcycle taxi that she will also rent out and thus have daily income to pay for household expenses. Both activities attracted her because she can receive good, daily income. She is happy because she can help to support her family. She hopes that her work goes well for her so she just can keep working. This is loan number 8 with MFP. She is grateful to the people who made access to this loan possible, since she will feel safer going ahead with her work.

"This is Arnel, 30, a resident of Intramuros, Philippines. His wife is Richelle, a vendor. Arnel, together with his wife, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArnel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. He earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nArnel hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams that his children will finish their studies.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nErlinda dreams to have a shop in the mall and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She has a showcase in her house, where her customers arrive in search of perfumes, powders, creams, deodorants, any useful accessory. She has done this for 5 years, working alone and earning well. She eventually will alternate this work with the sale of sodas, depending on the season. For now, she continues to work in the sale of cosmetics and likes what she does. She says that the profits with customers have managed to consolidate over the years. She is very happy with the independence that she has because she is able to earn her own profits to afford necessary household expenses. She wants to continue working and to expand her business to continue progressing, since she wants to offer to her children the opportunity to obtain a quality education through professional studies.\r\nThis is her 8th loan with MFP.

With the requested amount of 2000 soles, she will mainly purchase cosmetics such as powders, creams, perfumes, and other items. Additionally, she will purchase 5 cases of sodas to sell, due to the intense heat in the area that she lives.

She has her place in the fishing port of the city. She gets up very early to purchase the products wholesale from the fisherman who arrive with all that they have collected on their fishing trips. She chooses the species that have highest demand among her customers such as \"harvest fish\", \"catfish\", and \"sardines\". Additionally, she selects some species that aren't as requested but that have a really good market price, such as \"doncella\" and dry salted fish, always respecting closed seasons. She buys wholesale by the basket and sells by kilos. She has done this work for approximately 41 years, and says that with this work she was able to feed and provide education for her son. Now she works alone and continues doing so because it is the only means to generate income for her household. What she likes about her work is that she has time in the afternoons to be in her house and rest, since she considers working at her age unequal to when she was young. Additionally, she always was independent and is used to fending for herself. She hopes to be able to maintain this same rate of employment, and to continue working for much more time.\r\nThis is the 5th loan with MFP. She is very grateful for the loan opportunity that they offer, and for the financial backing that she needs to continue getting ahead.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGracia dreams to improve her way of living and hopes to give good and quality educations to her children through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAnilyn operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, and sell them with a little profit. Her products are men and women\u2019s clothes and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnilynl hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education.

She has five years' experience in this trade. She was inspired to start her business when she started studying fashion design at university. She makes mainly dresses for women and girls. She designs the clothes herself, then cuts the cloth, sews the garment together and applies the finishing touches. Her customers buy directly from her workshop. She is very attentive to the needs of her customers, who come to her referred by previous ones. The time of the year where she sells the most clothes is during the last quarter, particularly the first two months of it. Her customers can pay outright or buy on credit. Leicy starts working at 8 in the morning and stops at 6 in the evening. If there are many orders, she might work until later. Her goal is to expand her workshop, which is why she asks for this loan, her first one through field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy supplies and raw materials such as cloth, thread, buttons, zippers, and other accessories. Her customers will be dressed to the nines for Christmas and New Year's Eve!

He lives with his parents and his two brothers. They all live together in a rustic house of their own, built in an agricultural district. Hammer is an enthusiastic and hard-working young man. He has been helping his parents with the farm since he was fifteen. Now that his parents have gifted him with two parcels, he can grow whatever produce he considers to be most profitable, such as potatoes, peas, and sweetcorn. He also grows produce in other fields, which he rents. \"I usually sow around 40 sacks of potato seeds and 4 sacks of pea seeds a year', he tells us. His harvest is always plentiful and he manages to sell his produce at a good price at the wholesale market of Tarma. The buyers then sell the merchandise in various cities of the country, such as Lima, Arequipa, Ica, and other cities of the coast. Two months ago, Hammer sowed twenty sacks of potato seeds and is hoping from some help from Kiva lenders in order to buy fertiliser and keep tending to his crops. This is his third loan with field partner MFP, and he promises to be punctual in his monthly repayments. He belongs to communal bank 'Siempre Juntos' ('Always Together'), with which he is very happy because of the support and solidarity shown by the members. He will use this loan to buy guano from poultry pens to use as organic fertiliser for his potato plants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1221027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of guano to use as organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-21T19:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-20T19:00:32Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hammer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":159.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":173.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":169.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":186.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":193.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":194.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":214.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.84,"local_amount":167.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":172.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053708,"comment":null},{"amount":64.26,"local_amount":160.65,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":165.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188645,"comment":null},{"amount":71.72,"local_amount":179.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":185.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572556,"comment":null},{"amount":74.4,"local_amount":185.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":191.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122216,"comment":null},{"amount":77.17,"local_amount":192.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":199.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868042,"comment":null},{"amount":77.72,"local_amount":194.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":200.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576881,"comment":null},{"amount":82.94,"local_amount":207.36,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":213.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529219,"comment":null},{"amount":84.95,"local_amount":212.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":219.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T14:29:43Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":485511,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a general store business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 24,000 through NWTF to buy additional stock to sell through her general store.\r\n\r\nEvelyn has been in this business for 10 years.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

is 42 years old. His wife works as a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs during maize production. The profits from the business will be used to buy a tractor.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With this new cow, he will be able to save the money that he would normally need to spend on milk and milk products for his family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to expand this into a farm and to buy a calf as well to sell dairy products.

Janet has applied for a loan of Shs. 300,000 from MCDT SACCO to buy beans, peas, ground nuts, salt, sugar, maize flour, rice, books, pens, pencils, and cooking oil for the shop. \r\n\r\nThe main business challenges for her business are transport and defaulters.  \r\n\r\nJanet\u2019s goals and aspirations include building a house on her plot, and owning a wholesale shop.  She says she decided to work with MCDT SACCO because of trust.  She is renting the house she lives in; the family has no access to electricity or piped water.

photographed here in his grocery store, is a 22-year-old single young man. \r\nFor the past two years, Rami has sold different types of groceries in his store. It has been a profitable project and his only source of income, but not enough to cover the costs.\r\nRami is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him purchase a needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request and buy such as rice, sugar, dairy products and canned food. The loan also would help him make improvements in the store's condition such as installing additional shelves. Taking this loan will increase sales and increase Rami's income, which will ensure him better living conditions.\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
