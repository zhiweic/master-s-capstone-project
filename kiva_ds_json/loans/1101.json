The group was established last year. This is their second loan cycle from Friendship Bridge. These ladies primarily work in the production and sale of textiles and fabrics.\r\n\r\nCrisanta is a 55-year-old mother of four boys. She is preliterate because when she was young, her parents were unable to provide her with the opportunity to attend school. Her husband works in the masonry business. Crisanta works in fabric and textile production, which has been her business for quite some time. In addition, she purchases and sells textiles. Crisanta travels by bus to a market three hours from her home to sell not only her own products but those of her ten providers as well.\r\n\r\nCrisanta is excited about the loan she is about to receive from Friendship Bridge. It will allow her to buy yarn and fabric to make more products. She is happy because two of her boys are enrolled in school this year, and one of them is about to start high school. Crisanta hopes to continue to support him so that he can graduate in two years.\r\n\r\nBoth Crisanta and the other ladies of the Trust Bank, Los Girasoles Xenacoj, enjoy the training that they receive during the monthly meeting with Friendship Bridge. They especially like the icebreaker, which they find is a real stress reliever.

She is most aware of the need for medical personnel in her community, both in small clinics and health centers. As she speaks both Spanish and her local Mayan dialect, she feels that she will be an asset to the people whom she will serve. She looks forward to serving her patients with understanding and compassion. Mayra will work at her business during the week and has scheduled her nursing classes over the weekends.\r\n\r\nMayra and the rest of the ladies of Las Azucenas de Xenacoj, are so pleased and excited to receive a microloan. With this special opportunity, they will be able to improve their own lives and the lives of their family members. The community will progress, as well. Mayra will play a significant role in the future of the town.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3220.78,"image":{"id":1333673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To

Most of the ladies work on backstrap looms creating beautiful textiles, while a few are the owners of small storefronts. Their businesses really make a positive impact on the economies of their families.\r\n\r\nDominga is a 40-year-old member of the Trust Bank.

She was pleased to invest her first loan from Friendship Bridge in her business. She mentioned that before making a final choice about her current business, she explored other options. However, she decided that having a storefront business was a good fit for her and her family. It is located in a small room of her house, so she can attend to it from home. This business has helped Dominga to support her children, and they help her with small jobs or assisting her in the business.\r\n\r\nThis is Dominga's second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge, and her first with Kiva. She feels very grateful to have this monetary support that allows her to grow financially. She plans to buy more inventory for her business and will purchase useful items like rice, sugar, vegetables, canned goods and other products that are in great demand. In this way, she can continue serving her current clients and attract new ones.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank, San Miguel Xenacoj, would like to thank Kiva investors for this valuable opportunity to secure a loan.

His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Luz is a merchant who has owned a CD shop for more than seven years.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe started in the retail trade using money she received from her severance pay as capital.  At that point, she decided to establish her own business of selling CDs.  Upon evaluating her business, she determined that she needed more investment.  Therefore, Luz figured that she needed to request loans from financial institutions so that she could gradually strengthen her business.  She receives additional income from a disability pension.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz is requesting a loan so that she can buy music CDs and DVD movies.  She believes that the loan will help her buy all the CDs that she is lacking in her inventory and that are most requested by her customers.  One of her future plans is to improve the infrastructure of her shop so that it will have a better appearance.  Her next goal is to establish another business, such as a bookstore.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1335220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy music CDs and DVD movies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-04-20T07:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-20T07:20:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":410.1,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.87,"local_amount":52.95,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":54.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166144,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":45.56,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":47.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971960,"comment":null},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":45.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837324,"comment":null},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":38.21,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":39.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860611,"comment":null},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":45.57,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":47.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349318,"comment":null},{"amount":188.87,"local_amount":182.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":188.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901440,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T23:09:29Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":550424,"name":"Diana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Diana, de 44 a\u00f1os de edad,esta casada , vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su pareja y de su hijo de 14 a\u00f1os de edad, habitando su casa propia.El negocio que tiene Diana es la venta de suplementos nutricionales elaborados a base de productos naturales como caf\u00e9 ,cacao , entre otros.

She is married and has 2 small children who live with her in their own home. Katiuska decorates children\u2019s parties for a living. To do this she buys different dolls, decorative signs, fabric and other accessories to decorate. On occasion she will buy custom decorations depending on what the customer wants, the theme of the party, and the age of the person. Her sister and her cousin help her. Her customers know her work or they have heard about her through word of mouth.  She has an eye for decorating and this is reflected in the atmosphere she creates for her events. She has been doing this for 2 years and things are going well. She previously sold clothing on credit, but she had too many customers who failed to pay her so she had to quit this activity. Things are going well for her now and the thing she likes most about her job is the satisfaction she gets when she sees the look on her customers\u2019 faces when they see what she has created in small spaces. She also likes that this job is very flexible and allows her to take care of her youngest child. She now wants to buy fabric and chairs that she needs for her business in order to give her customers better service and generate more income by renting these items. She is requesting a loan of S\/ 500. She is grateful to those who will make this loan possible and for giving her the opportunity to continue working to achieve her goals.

She's asking for a loan of $1050 to buy more goods like thread, needles, mirrors, etc., to achieve these goals.

She lives in Marneuli District with her parents. Aiten requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays, the family is out of a source of income. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAiten requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

His mother works at the local grocery shop as a seller. They both get small monthly salaries which are barely enough to cover family monthly expenses. \r\nGaga requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Gaga will start trading with wood materials himself. As he is already experienced in this field, Gaga will purchase wood materials at the wholesale price from Turkey at a low cost and sell them with a price markup to the resellers among his district.  He will use part of the profit for reinvesting in the same field and purchase more materials in order to develop the business.

Est\u00e1 casado con Bella quien tiene 59 a\u00f1os y se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo, juntos han compartido la dicha de ver crecer a su hijo que ahora ya es un adulto independiente que form\u00f3 su familia. Ram\u00f3n vive con su esposa en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde en Santo Domingo, una ciudad del Ecuador que se ha convertido en uno de los puertos terrestres m\u00e1s importantes a nivel comercial, pues es en donde se unen las Regiones Costa y Sierra del pa\u00eds y por lo tanto en donde se intercambian productos de distinta \u00edndole y variedad; desde frutas tropicales hasta mariscos frescos tra\u00eddos del mar. Por esta oportunidad que tiene la ciudad, muchas familias han salido y producido su sustento a trav\u00e9s de la microempresa en diferentes industrias como la pesquera, bananera, manufactura, agricultura y ganader\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s el paso de turistas nacionales internacionales es aprovechado para explotar la actividad tur\u00edstica con deportes extremos y caminatas a paisajes que tienen una belleza natural incomparable. \nRam\u00f3n forma parte de estas familias emprendedoras, pues hered\u00f3 el esp\u00edritu trabajador de su familia y adem\u00e1s un amigo le ense\u00f1\u00f3 la actividad de comercializar pescado en la cual ya lleva 24 a\u00f1os, pues desde ni\u00f1o tuvo que trabajar para apoyar en el gasto de su hogar. Este hombre con alma a\u00fan joven, invierte 8 horas en su diario vivir para sacar a la venta su producto, el madruga a los puertos a retirar el pescado fresco para enseguida y con los debidos cuidados higi\u00e9nicos, llevarlo a vender a un puesto que est\u00e1 ubicado en su residencia. Como es de suponerse el pescado es vendido en su totalidad cada d\u00eda, de lo contrario tiene que ser congelado en temperatura baj\u00edsima para que no se eche a perder. Ahora Ram\u00f3n requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a adquirir herramientas de trabajo y equipo para mantener en buen estado los activos que posee. As\u00ed podr\u00e1 abastecerse de mayor producto y comprar variedad con mayor descuento para ofrecer a sus clientes un precio m\u00e1s competitivo que le generar\u00e1 mayor utilidad para poder disponer de un ahorro que responda a sus necesidades de salud y sustento en los a\u00f1os de su vejez con su esposa. Ram\u00f3n agradece por cada granito de arena que se ponga desde cualquier parte del mundo a trav\u00e9s de Kiva para que \u00e9l crezca en su negocio ya que a pesar de su edad, nada lo ha detenido para seguir luchando cada d\u00eda por su trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa de quienes ha recibido el apoyo, la confianza y agilidad que en varias instituciones financieras le hizo falta para incrementar su capital de trabajo. ","en":"Ram\u00f3n is a man of advanced age; he is 63 years old and nostalgically remembers his childhood with his family, when he was able to complete primary school. He is married to Bella, who is 59 years old and works selling cosmetics from catalogs. Together, they have shared the joy of watching their son\u2014now an independent adult with his own family\u2014grow up. Ram\u00f3n lives with his wife in the R\u00edo Verde parish of Santo Domingo, a city in Ecuador that has become one of the most important inland commercial hubs, as it is where the coastal and mountain regions of the country meet. As such, it is where a wide variety of different kinds of products are exchanged, from tropical fruits to fresh seafood brought from the ocean. Because of this opportunity that the city has, many families have gone out and earned a living  through small businesses within different industries such as fishing, banana farming, manufacturing, agriculture, and livestock production. In addition, they take advantage of the flow of national and international tourists to develop the tourism industry with extreme sports and treks to landscapes of incomparable natural beauty.\r\n\r\nRam\u00f3n is is part of this group of enterprising families, as he inherited his family's hardworking spirit. In addition, a friend taught him the business of selling fish, which he has done for 24 years; he had to work starting from childhood to contribute to household expenses. This young-at-heart man invests eight hours of his daily life to selling his product. At dawn he goes to the ports to get the fresh fish to take it immediately and with the necessary hygienic measures to his sales stall, located in his house. As one might expect, he sells all the fish each day; otherwise, it must be frozen at extremely low-temperature so that nothing spoils. Now Ram\u00f3n needs a loan that will help him to acquire work tools and equipment to keep his assets in good conditions. Then he will be able to store more product and buy a variety of fish at a greater discount in order to offer his customers a more competitive price. That will generate greater profits, which he can put into savings to provide for the health and living expenses of his golden years with his wife. \r\n\r\nRam\u00f3n is grateful for every grain of sand that is contributed from any part of the world through Kiva so that he can grow his business, because despite his age, nothing has stopped him from striving every day in his work. He is also grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, from whom he has received support, trust, and flexibility\u2014which are lacking in many financial institutions\u2014to increase his working capital.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1020.15,"image":{"id":1335171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase tools and work equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-21T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-21T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon  Bartolome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1584.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":126.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":128.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":131.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.02},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":139.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":142.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":145.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":147.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":107.27,"local_amount":106.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":107.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133255,"comment":null},{"amount":122.62,"local_amount":121.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":122.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313794,"comment":null},{"amount":125.91,"local_amount":124.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":125.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565399,"comment":null},{"amount":127.52,"local_amount":126.29,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":127.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814438,"comment":null},{"amount":130.03,"local_amount":128.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":130.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320610,"comment":null},{"amount":133.23,"local_amount":131.94,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856300,"comment":null},{"amount":135.22,"local_amount":133.92,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":135.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059875,"comment":null},{"amount":138.35,"local_amount":137.02,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":138.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995218,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T23:46:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551160,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gracias por apoyar a Yolanda pues con su credikiva logr\u00f3 comprar tela y elabor\u00f3 ropa para damas e infantil, aumentando con ello su capital de trabajo; tambien agreg\u00f3 mas clientes y aument\u00f3 sus utiliades.

They have one tricycle that can carry up to four passengers to their destination within the community. The tricycle driver then remits a boundary (daily quota) each day to her. In her business the regular customers are the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan.

She has been engaged in the current business for 10 years. With VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner, she is the nine-cycled client. After the last loan which she has repaid back completely, she feels so empowered that she can sustain her living status in proper condition. Now, she is in need of working capital, so she formed a group of four to apply for a new loan. She is seeking for 1,400,000 KHR while her co-borrowers are seeking for 1,000,000 KHR. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to buy construction materials to support her husband\u2019s occupation. She hopes that she and her husband can make more profit and keep her children in school until tertiary level."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":843.6,"image":{"id":1334596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy construction materials to support her husband\u2019s occupation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Sangke district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-04-21T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-21T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreymao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Savun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":366600},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":367400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364842251,"comment":null},{"amount":93.74,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373047563,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838669,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696802,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399943005,"comment":null},{"amount":93.74,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410226114,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420333057,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429642197,"comment":null},{"amount":93.74,"local_amount":366600,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":373704.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092333,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-21T21:13:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549974,"name":"Rosemarie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rosemarie, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines.
