He operates a business, making and selling fast foods like empanadas, corn flatbreads, fried dough balls, hot dogs, and rice drinks. He sells his food to neighbors and pedestrians, who pay in cash. His business is open every day from 6 AM until 9 PM. His mother helps prepare the food. He pays cash for his supplies to local farmers and merchants in the city's central market. His father gave him the business a year ago when he went to work for a company.\r\n\r\nThis is his first Kiva loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

Damira worked at a sewing factory after finishing a secondary school.  She has been involved in an agricultural business - animal husbandry and farming - since 1991, having started this business with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS).  The monthly income from the business amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Damira's hard work, today she has a good farm, containing two dairy cows, thirty sheep and four horses.  She also has 1.24 hectares of irrigated land.  The profit allowed Damira to increase livestock on her farm and, thus, improve the family welfare.  In order to further develop her business, Damira requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy livestock for fattening up and resale and also to buy mineral fertilizers for treating the land.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing livestock quantities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":721.88,"image":{"id":1382526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock for fattening up and resale and also to buy mineral fertilizers for treating the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Yintymak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":721.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1031.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":721.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":721.88,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35211.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-03T21:13:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":580780,"name":"Loh Martou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loh Martou is married with five children and lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the Bamenda, North West Province, of Cameroon.

In addition to that, the waste from pigs is used on the farm to get a high yield. With this business activity, the community will benefit from pig waste (manure) which will be used for farming, cassava from the farm as food, and her akra consumed mostly by school children. \r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will cater to her family's needs, ensure her children's education, expand her business and also save some money to undertake a bigger business investment.

is a farmer in Gwelekoro Village.  He is 44 years old and married with 6 children.  He is a 2nd year farmer with myAgro.  Broulaye would like a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the right distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Broulaye will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.\n\nBroulaye would like a semoir loan because it would facilitate planting and make it less expensive.  Before, Broulaye planted manually which was time-consuming and made it difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.

is a farmer in Tadianabougou Village.  He is 65 years old and married.  He is a 1st year farmer with myAgro.  Fasseli would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the right distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Fasseli will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income.  \n\nFasseli would like a semoir loan because he can work quickly with it and plant one hectare of land in one day.  Before, Fasseli planted manually which was time-consuming and made it difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.

He is 47 years old and married with 10 children.  He is a 1st year farmer with myAgro and plants maize.  Bakary would like to take a loan for a semoir, which is a local seeding machine that has 2 boxes: one for seed and one for fertilizer.  The semoir is attached to a cow that will pull the semoir along the field, and there are diggers and a pipe behind each box that will place the correct amount of seed and fertilizer the right distance apart.  This enables farmers to plant using the micro-dosing method of planting \u2013 using a small amount of fertilizer per plant instead of the traditional method of broadcasting fertilizer.  This is less expensive since it uses less fertilizer and is much better for land sustainability as well.  myAgro hopes that by providing the semoir on loan, Bakary will be able to increase the amount of land he plants using the micro-dosing method and significantly increase his farm income. \n   \nBakary would like a semoir because, compared to manual planting, the semoir is much quicker and can help increase his harvest size.  Before, Bakary planted manually which was time-consuming and made it difficult to grow enough food to meet the needs of his family.  Bakary goals are to have a good harvest and for his family to be happy.  Bakary says myAgro helps him reach his goals by continuing to enable farmers to pay little by little for the fertilizer and seed packages.  Bakary will also be able to rent his semoir to others to earn extra income.  All semoirs are covered by a 2-year guarantee that covers most repairs within a 1-week time period. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1381798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougoula","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":302,"posted_date":"2013-07-09T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-08T21:30:06Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-12T22:57:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":580897,"name":"Lilibeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Lilibeth works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a general store business in the Philippines and earns additional income from rice-retailing.

(NORIA), an association of organic rice farmers located on the island of Negros, Philippines. It is an SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) registered association with over 300 organic rice farmers from various parts of the island on its membership roster.\n\nThe majority of members have small landholdings \u2013 all below 4 hectares in size. Many have about a hectare, which they acquired from the government as Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries. \n\nWith no economies of scale, it would have been practical for them to follow conventional methods using chemical fertilizers paired with a good dose of pesticides to boost their production. But in spite of the obvious hurdles organic farming entails, these small farmers made a conscious choice to convert their land into organic rice farms because they believe that going back to nature will ensure a healthier lifestyle for themselves, their families and communities.\n\nMany of these organic practitioners also believe that this is the way to ensure food security of the island. They also believe that moving away from chemical fertilizers and pesticides protects the environment and encourages the biodiversity of the island. \n\nTo ensure that the members benefit from the premium going organic provides, NORIA, led by its President, Ahmon, and Leo, head of the association\u2019s Business Management Committee, is borrowing PHP 1,000,000.00 from NWTF. The group intends to use the money as a revolving credit line to purchase the organic rice harvest of its members. This ensures a fair price at the farm gate. \n\nBy consolidating the harvest and milling the rice themselves, NORIA is protecting the integrity and provenance of the organic rice, and this will enable it to market the certified organic rice at a premium. At the moment this certified organic rice is sold at the Negros Occidental Organic Market, but will soon be available in supermarkets in Negros and the neighboring islands.\n\nAt present, the association has about 300 hectares of certified organic rice farms, but with the boost in their buying capacity, they are hoping to be able to encourage more farmers to go organic and increase their land area up to 1,000 hectares by the end of the year. \n\nNORIA has 3 main objectives: first, to strengthen the organic rice farming industry in Negros by providing training in the best organic farming practices, second \u2013 to strengthen economic development and sustainability of organic rice farmers through private-public partnerships; and third, to ensure that the price of organic rice is stable and fair at the farm gate.\n\nNORIA is working hard to achieve Negros Island's vision of becoming the Organic Food Bowl of the Philippines.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":23100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1382158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase the organic rice harvest of the association's members at a fair price ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":23100,"lender_count":409,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Negros Organic Rice Industry Association, Inc.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":23100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T19:36:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576788,"name":"Yong's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yong is 51 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in a rural village of the Sa Ang district.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union she lost her job and to find a steady income to support her family she began farming and raising animials. She began her business with 10,000 somoni. Thankfully through her back-breaking labor and tireless work Kalbubu achieved a little progress and began to make a profit of 10,000 somoni a month. Nowadays on the farm Kalbubu has two cows and twenty sheep. She also had allotted land for planting and processing beans. In order to further develop her business, Kalbubu is appealing to \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan of 40,000 somoni to buy fertilizer and fuel.

Apart from being a person with high morals and a very responsible personality toward commitment, Cornelio maintains his employment at the cheese company in the community, where he earns a good income and is very well known.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in the city which is 35 kilometers away and travels on community transportation to get there.  The service is supposed to pass through the community four times a day but many times the buses do not run, making it hard to reach the city.  He makes his purchases at a place that gives him a good price because he is a frequent customer.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to pay for rental and cleaning of the land he farms and to buy supplies to plant 14,000 m2 of corn and 7,000 m2 of sorghum.\r\n\r\nOne of his main priorities is to earn an income for the family and insure he can have a monthly income from the sale of both crops.  The household is practically totally dependent on this activity.\r\n\r\nHe wants to set up a better home environment although the two live alone for now.

All of them are neighbors from the same community. It is a very beautiful community characterized by its enormous lake. The group members say that they can take advantage of the lake to fish for free. The community is also distinguished by its giant trees. The town's biggest holiday is celebrated on August 2, the day of Our Lady of the Angels. \n\nDo\u00f1a Yola, as she is affectionately known, is 38, and has been married to Raul for 20 years. He works as a construction worker. Together, they have made a family with five children. Yola is asking for the loan to buy notions like marbles, clothespins, ribbons, brooches, hairpins, nail clippers, files, and hooks, etc. This is her first time doing this activity. She has never had a business like this one. Previously she worked raising, fattening, and selling chicken, but she doesn't want to stay in this line of work because coyotes eat the chickens. Yola is planning on selling her goods by the door of the church. On Sundays, her daughters will attend to her business while she works as a domestic employee. \n\nShe is very glad she will start her business. She didn't have money to purchase her products, but thanks to the loan, she will have her new business. Thanks to this, she will be able to earn more income for her family. Yola wants to have her own, larger business in her home, with the ultimate goal of being able to help out with household expenses and the education that her children want. \"Two of my children did not want to continue studying, but I want the other three children, who are still studying, to study a professional degree.\"\n\nJust as Yola wants to better herself, the other group members are asking for a loan to invest in their economic activites: Marybel sells aprons and flowers, Trinidad has a beauty salon, Elena sells aprons, and Maria and Rosa Maria raise yearling sheep. Aurea and Filiberto will invest in their bull calves  and feed and Teresa will invess in her sweet sales. They are very glad and grateful to Kiva and VisionFund for the chance to get their loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":7325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":7325,"image":{"id":1379216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy notions

He belongs to a group of people who take out loans to improve their businesses to be able to give their families a better quality of life. His group is called Aves de Para\u00edso and he says that the other members of the group told him they gave it that name because where they used to meet there were some very pretty flowers with that name. He is married and has 5 children, 3 of whom are in school, since the oldest didn't want to go to school anymore and decided to start working. In the morning, Florencio sells popsicles and ice cream in the streets of his community. He says that he doesn't make them, he just buys them and sells them, mainly outside of schools, since most of his customers are children. In the afternoon, he fixes televisions in his home, since he doesn't have a locale. Sometimes people go to his house wanting him to fix an appliance. He says that he learned to fix appliances because a friend invited him to work and learn how to fix appliances and over time Florencio decided to start his own business. Now he is asking VisionFund for help so that he can get a loan to improve his businesses. He wants to stock up on ice cream and popsicles and also buy barquillos and plastic cups to sell the ice cream in. He also wants to buy different replacement parts and materials that he uses to give better service. Florencio's goal is to keep selling his ice cream and popsicles and also set up a workshop in his house to fix the appliances.

The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1182.25,"image":{"id":1385065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase an electric car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2013-07-10T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-09T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":54.74,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Byambasuren ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":311000},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287077.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":283386.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296754.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301054.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":309143.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":317448.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":325202.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":336193.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232738.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215.11,"local_amount":311000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":311476.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390553464,"comment":null},{"amount":185.82,"local_amount":287077.4,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":287517.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":12.74,"payment_id":399802483,"comment":null},{"amount":188.7,"local_amount":283386.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":283821.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.31,"payment_id":410078513,"comment":null},{"amount":190.34,"local_amount":296754.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":297209.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.91,"payment_id":419844951,"comment":null},{"amount":198.6,"local_amount":301054.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":301516.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":9.63,"payment_id":429493863,"comment":null},{"amount":203.68,"local_amount":309143.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":309617.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.15,"payment_id":439717998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T19:12:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581068,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Evelyn.

She is married to Ronelo, a construction worker. She is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nYvonne maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. She also has an RTW business and she also sells pork and chicken. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 60,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products, such as shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nYvonne hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1385078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn and modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, which is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1208786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

All five live in traditional and nuclear families in Kolondieba (a town and prefecture in the third administrative region of Mali). They got to know each other through bonds of kinship, community and marriage.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are retailers: they sell \"canaris\" (clay pots). In order to bolster their working capital, they decided to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are seeking their third solidarity loan (group loan).\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatoumata (first woman on the left in the photograph) is one of the pots sellers of the group. She intends to use her loan to manufacture clay pots (transporting clay, buying firewood bundles, and covering labor expenses).\r\n\r\nShe gets her supplies on the riverside and retails for cash and on credit, at her home and at the market, to a clientele comprising both men and women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, she intends to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 7'500 (ca US$ 15) to be in part reinvested in her business, and in part used to help her husband cover some family

14. She has vocational secondary education, and is an accountant by profession. Currently she works as a librarian at the local school. In 1998 she decided to work with livestock breeding. Thanks to her decisive character and persistence, she developed her farm and currently it has two cows, two steers and four sheep. She started this business with 3,000 som (KGS) and has increased monthly the income to 17,000 som (KGS). Her husband helps her with the business.

She is married and lives with her husband and three children in the J.Rumy region. \r\n\r\nIn the latest years Mavludakhon has worked as a cook at a cafe. Currently she would like to open her own family business. She is interested in sheep breeding. In her own words, sheep are unpretentious and breeding them is not laborious. And because sheep are grazing animals she won't have any problems with fodder. Besides, this wonderful animal gives more types of products than other types of livestock. In particular: Meat, fat, milk, wool, fur products, astrakhan fur and leather.

Now he and his sons are farmers. Before, in Soviet times, he worked on a farm, so he has lots of experience in this field. In addition to working with livestock, Karshiboy has a plot of land where he grows onions, carrots, and tomatoes. His wife and daughter help him. While Karshiboy and his sons are busy farming his wife and daughter look after the cattle; they milk the cows and produce dairy products from the milk such as yogurt, cottage cheese, and butter. Karshiboy is very busy in the summer and therefore goes to the market early in the morning to deliver the harvest of vegetables and trade with wholesale merchants. At this time Karshiboy wants to grow his herd and for this purpose he applied to Arvand. He is very glad and thankful for the loan that will let him grow his herd."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1383817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity; however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Filipino.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1385126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

lives in Malindi, Kenya. The 28-year-old father of one runs a cyber cafe, and a tour and travel agency in Malindi. His business mostly targets tourists who visit the north coastal town. The cyber cafe deals with photocopying, internet and booking reservations for the tourists visiting the country. He met Milango through an employee, and he found this to be an opportunity to access credit to fund his business.

Arsena has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

The main source of income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have a vineyard and a plot of agricultural land, where 85 peach trees are grown. Nika and his brothers do all the agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. As well as these activities, Nika works as an artisan and repairs damaged cars and motorbikes. He is a very hardworking young man and does his best to increase the income of his family. Nika requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nika has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Nika will purchase piglets. After purchasing the piglets he will be able to start an animal husbandry business. As the piglets grow, he will sell some of them at a higher price. Other pigs will be used to start a new generation and expand the business for the future.
