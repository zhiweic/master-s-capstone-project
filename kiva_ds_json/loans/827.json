She has 3 children, but she lives with only one of them, Lisbeth, in her own house, located in the town of Paccha. She mainly grows potatoes, corn and also alfalfa to feed her animals. She has cows, calves and sheep, which with the help of her daughter she takes to graze in the countryside when her alfalfa production is low. This happens generally in the summer season, when it is not produced in sufficient quantities, and what she is able to harvest she sells at the provincial market in her town. She also sells her animals from time to time, such as sheep, cows and bulls, when an opportunity for a sale presents itself. Generally, the buyers come to her home. She thinks it is good to work in these two parallel activities to maintain stability in her income and gradually expand her business. However, since she is very hard-working, she also works packaging chicken meat in a company. She reports that she does this 2 or 3 times a week, since she has to take care of her animals and crops. Now she has set concrete goals to continue to expand her business, and she is sure that she will achieve them. She found out about MFP through a neighbor in her community who invited her to join the communal bank, where she is now a member for the second cycle. Throughout this time she has demonstrated responsibility with her payments, and she has won confidence for being a person who can be vouched for, so she can continue having access to loans, which are her opportunity for growth. \r\n\r\nUpon receiving her support, Olga will invest the funds she is requesting in buying medicines in bulk to prepare by type and dosage for her animals, and if she still has sufficient funds, she will also be able to buy alfalfa for them. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1053211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy medicines for her animals and alfalfa.

She sells her harvest wholesale and also, depending on the situation, sells the use of a plot so that the harvest is done by others. While waiting for the harvest she works as an educator for adults whom she teaches to read and write, an activity from which she derives a stable income. She also owns 6 small sheep that graze on the family farm. Since she is a hardworking woman, she also sells beauty products from catalogues, an activity which generates a nice income because she is the only one in this type of business in the area. She enjoys every single one of her activities because she likes them and her knowledge helps her carry them out in the best way. She sees the future with great enthusiasm and wishes to increase her income in order to prepare her daughter's future, because she wants to give her the best. She belongs to the communal bank \"productores agr\u00edcolas\" (agriculture producers) and this is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She was invited by a member of her family to become part of the communal bank, of which she is an active member; she is always punctual with her payments and is thus very happy now to work in order to consolidate her working capital.

She has lived with her husband Ra\u00fal for 26 years. They have 4 children, only 2 of whom live with them: Anderson and Jefferson, whom they raise in the home they own in the village of Paccha. Emerita's whole life is tied to agriculture and animal husbandry, her sources of income. When she founded a family with her husband, they decided to intensify their activity by planting mainly potatoes and broad beans in large quantities. They also have grazing grounds for their cattle in various plots of arable land that Emerita and her husband inherited. Agriculture is an activity she very much enjoys and likes doing because she is always in contact with earth and nature, which she finds very calming. But since she is a hardworking woman, every morning she takes her bulls, cows and sheep out to graze. She tells us that she wants to churn cheese but does not yet own enough dairy cows. What she does use her bulls for is to till her own land: as she says, \"this way I do not have to pay someone to prepare the soil\". Very soon, she will buy more sheep, with the help of her husband who works in a mine. She belongs to the communal bank \"productores agr\u00edcolas\" (agriculture producers) and this is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is one of the oldest members of her bank, and feels very proud of the fact, because she has had the chance to make her business grow consistently thanks to the loans she received.

The route that he works runs from the central plaza to the office of public records.  His wife monitors the arrival of the cars that they have in their fleet, and in this way they make a good team for their business.  However, since he has a license to drive trucks, he works as a driver transporting heavy cargo throughout the country.  He says that soon he will travel to Moya to transport wheat, where they pay him very well, as the transportation of food products requires a lot of responsibility.  This is his 19th loan with MFP, and he feels happy, because he has the capital he needs to improve his business, and therefore his quality of life.

He has lived with his wife, Bertha, for the past twenty-seven years. They both have two children that they take care of in their own home, which is located in the town of San Carlos. At his age, he is an entrepreneur who is saving money to be able to start two musical groups together with other people who are well-known in the area, so as to earn more income. He is constantly advertising his group\u2019s appearances. At the same time, he rents musical and audio equipment, such as amplifiers, percussion instruments, guitars, and sound mixers, among others. He has been working this way for thirty years. He is also a real estate agent who sells houses for third parties, who pay him a commission for each sale, along with land for the construction of houses for third parties. His work involves purchasing a lot for a low price and then re-selling it for a higher price. Thanks to these efforts, he has been able to save a considerable amount of money. \u201cI can\u2019t mix my capital. I have capital for my equipment rental shop, another for my real estate business, and another for my musical group,\u201d he says. As a result, he always works with established budgets, which help him to manage his business. This is his fourth loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma]. He is happy because he has the capital he needs to improve his business and, as a result, his quality of life. Additionally, he likes belonging to his group because the members are hard-working and caring. After receiving his loan, Ecederio will invest the money he is requesting by paying for posters, newspaper advertisements, and musical production for his musical groups.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1054579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to pay for advertising space in the newspaper and musical production for his band.

Adelina began to work for a living, selling tortillas and sweets, when she was very young, which she has done to help her family get ahead. She\u2019s been working this way for quite some time. She\u2019s been working together with one of her granddaughters for the past twenty-four years, getting up at 4:00 AM to make her tortillas.

She is also grateful because she is managing to offer her children a better quality of living and an adequate education.

Moreover, due to these drawbacks, she has plans to open a small grocery store in a stall in the city market. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP institution. She is very happy to know that she will have a loan, as this way she will sure of supporting herself through her business.

In addition, she is very decisive and cheerful.  She lives with Hidelbrando who is employed, but they have no children since that is not part of their plans.  Most of all, they want to succeed personally.  Both of them live in a house owned by her sister.  Gleydys has an agricultural business, primarily growing cassava since this area is suitable for this product.  She has a plot of land containing 17 hectares owned by her father, who leased the property to her without cost so that she could farm.  Gleydys is looking for new and better opportunities in life.  She currently has two hectares that are producing cassava that she will take to the markets in the city to sell.  Gleydys also sells in other cities since there is suitable demand.  She  started farming more than five years ago.  In order to maintain the land and harvest the crops, she has the help of two other workers who are hired as needed and paid a salary of 20 PEN each day.  \r\n<p>\r\nGleydys considers her business to be profitable since there is demand and her earnings have been good.  The price of her product has increased due to shortages.  She enjoys this business because she has more income compared to the lower salary earned from her previous job.  Gleydys also lives comfortably.  She learned how to work in the fields from her parents.  Since she has achieved good results, she has plans to continue her business and maintain it.  This will be her third loan with the MFP organization and she is pleased to have access to credit.  In order to continue her business, Gleydys wants to keep receiving this support.  She promises to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  The amount of 1000 PEN that she requested will be invested in planting cassava on the additional tracts of land (less the existing two hectares that have already been planted).  In order to this, she plans to hire workers.  Her goal is to increase production since there is demand for this product.  Since the prices tend to stay high, Gleydys will be able to earn more income.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1049288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gleydys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":162.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":184.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.51},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119.75,"local_amount":319.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":319.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714158,"comment":null},{"amount":62.19,"local_amount":165.83,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203057,"comment":null},{"amount":131.57,"local_amount":350.84,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":351.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401580,"comment":null},{"amount":61.49,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":164.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455877,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-11T00:40:26Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409893,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a 44-year-old married woman with children, living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

She is also cheerful and kind.  She is separated from the father of her two children, 26 year old Richard and 22 year old Melina.  It is for them that she has worked hard to get ahead.  She lives comfortably with her children in her own house.\r\n\r\nYsabel\u2019s business is selling food like \u201cjuanes\u201d, (similar to tamales, except made with rice and stuffed with fish, chicken, or yucca), grilled fish, tamales, and others.  She does this Monday through Friday at night.  She tends to her customers in a kind way.  She has managed to have her business be well-received and in demand.  She sets up in the front of her house with a table and some chairs.\r\n\r\nShe has had this business for ten years, and she counts on her sister\u2019s help.  She started with money from a loan that a relative gave her.  She considers her business to be profitable because of the good income it gives her.  She manages to sell everything she prepares daily.  This is thanks to how well-received her business is with her customers.\r\n\r\nShe likes to cook, and she learned the secrets of good seasoning from her mother.  Her income allows her to pay her bills and her household expenses.  She does now like being physically tired.  She has to get up very early in the morning to make the daily preparations.  However, this does not discourage her, and she continues with her business.  She wishes to expand her business and to improve her roof, where she will be able to tend to her customers more comfortably.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your collaboration in order to be able to firm up her plans.  Also, she says that she is comfortable with her communal bank, and she considers the members to be responsible people.  She will use the requested 4,000 soles to fix her floor.  She will also buy tables, chairs, and kitchen utensils in order to renovate her equipment.  This way she hopes to be more popular with her customers.  She will also buy the ingredients she needs to prepare the food.  She will buy things like rice, oil, noodles, and others, and she will be looking for low prices.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1050586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to fix the floor; to buy tables, chairs and utensils, and to buy rice, oil, and noodles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-08T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-08T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":315.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":350.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":355.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":382.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":390.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":406.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":425.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":442.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":461.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":471.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.39,"local_amount":315.7,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":316.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203062,"comment":null},{"amount":131.28,"local_amount":350.07,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":350.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098734,"comment":null},{"amount":133.14,"local_amount":355.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":355.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401585,"comment":null},{"amount":143.37,"local_amount":382.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":382.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451530,"comment":null},{"amount":973.82,"local_amount":2596.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2600.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187780,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

His income goes to their daily expenses, allowance for his child, the basic needs of his infant, and rent for the restaurant. So his income is no longer enough to buy ingredients, raw pork, vegetables, and fish. For this reason, he is asking for a loan amounting to 20,000 Philippine pesos.

She is one of those ladies who started working as soon as she had completed her education. As a matter of fact, she had been working while studying on order to contribute to her family\u2019s budget. Since she had devoted all her life to working, she had postponed the idea of marriage and only recently became engaged. As an eagerly devoted business woman following her graduation, she started working in the printing shop of her uncle without knowing anything about the business. Due to her eagerness and perseverance within a short time, she mastered the printing business. In time, when her uncle started a new business, he turned over the management and ownership of the printing house to Serap. Naturally she had some financial difficulties in the beginning and she still has, but she overcomes these difficulties with the support of Maya. She developed her business of the printing shop into the organization business, started entering into areas such as wedding invitations, and wedding candies.  Currently she has very good customer connections. She will use the current loan from Maya via Kiva to buy paper and edge cutting machines, and stamps. These machines will help her to decrease her costs by keeping certain jobs in house which she had been previously outsourcing, thus increasing her profit.  She always expresses her gratitude to Maya for their support.\r\n \r\nThe two other members of the group are marketing the products of a cleaning company both from home and from the store (with the support of Serap). They are thankful for the Maya loans, which provide them with working capital that enables them to buy products in bigger wholesale lots. \r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya

She lives with Elmer, who works in transportation, and they have two beautiful children, Deysi, 13 and Flor, 5, whom they love very much. They live comfortably in their own house.\r\n\r\nRosa has a business selling fruit ices from a refrigerator. Once they are ready, she takes them to school where she has a small stand in the cafeteria. From there she cordially serves her customers, who are students and teachers. She started this business over four years ago and during that time she has worked alone.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business very profitable because of the demand for her products due to the hot climate in the area. She likes her business since it enables her to have an income with which she can pay for household expenses and the needs of her small children who motivate her to continue moving forward. She does not like it when it rains very frequently, thereby lowing sales and reducing profits but even then the business still manages to be profitable. Therefore she plans to continue it by increasing her available inventory. This will be her first loan with MFP. She is grateful for the financial help to continue with her business and to move forward with her plans.\r\n\r\nShe is also pleased with her communal bank since she considers its members to be good and committed people.

is 34 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has 2 children, one of whom is currently in school. For the past 3 years, Calvin has been working hard to manage her small business, selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Calvin has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and it will help Calvin to generate greater profits and increase her capital. Calvin hopes that in the future she will be able to earn more money to expand her business.\r\n\r\nCalvin is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

He is currently in his second loan cycle, after having correctly repaid his first loan. With the loan that he received, he paid the workers who cultivated his fields and bought inputs, 300 kg of potatoes, as well as 21 kg of chemical fertilizer. The difficulty that he foresees in terms of repaying his loan is climate change.\r\n\r\nJean Pierre's strategy is to expand his farming by buying another field and planting more. Doing so will be possible with other loans in the future. His strategy will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming a major potato farmer in the region. With respect to his family, he plans to pay the school fees for his children once they start going to school.

She is also cheerful and kind.  She lives with Enrique, who is retired and the father of their three children.  It is for the children that they have made such efforts to get ahead.  She lives with her life partner and their children in their own house.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s business is selling food, mostly breakfasts and a set menu.  She has a place set up at her own house where she opened her restaurant.  It is set up with tables, chairs, and the utensils needed to tend to her customers very well.  Seeing that her area is busy, she feels that she has demand.  Due to her life partner\u2019s illness, she saw the financial needs that her household had.  She decided to start in this business over 12 years ago.  In the beginning she worked alone, but now she counts on help from her children.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be very profitable.  She says this is because the profit margins are very good, and the regular clientele that she has are to her benefit.  She really likes to cook.  She learned from her mother, who taught her the secrets of good seasoning.  With this she hopes to be able to continue with customer acceptance and being their preference.\r\n\r\nAlso, she has plans to grow, and in the future she plans to expand her restaurant by opening a branch in a commercial zone in the city of Pucallpa.  This way she will manage to get greater income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her tenth loan with MFP.  She hopes for your collaboration in order to continue on with her objectives.

He lives with his mother, Guida, his father, Gregorio, and his two siblings, Melvin and Talia, whom he cares for in his own home, located in the town of Ancalayo.  As the oldest son, he works to help his parents and siblings.  \"My parents are older, and they need my support,\" he states.  To do this, he has for some time now, with the help of Angel, his partner, rented a brick-making workshop where he makes 30,000 bricks a month, selling these on the basis of monthly orders to his regular customers.  He is always offering his customers the best products that he knows how to make.  In addition to this, thanks to his efforts, he has 2 bulls that he feeds with a lot of dedication.  He says that he also cultivates alfalfa, which he uses to feed them.  Thus, he must bear long days of work plowing the land.  Now he wants to start up a business raising cows, because there is a demand for fresh milk.  To do this, he will take the first step by purchasing a quality cow.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he feels happy, because he found the help that he needed so much to realize his plans.  In addition, he is responsible in all of his work, and so he promises to be on time with his payments.  Once Blidmer receives your support, he will invest the money requested in the purchase of a cow, which costs an average of 2,000 Peruvian soles.  He has already saved up a little money, and so with this loan he will gather together enough money to make this purchase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1056902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Jhon is a very kind-hearted man who works as a taxi driver.  His work routine is to get up very early, because he is affiliated with a transportation line where each worker must wait his turn to go out and provide taxi services.  Jhon has been doing this work successfully for 7 years, although he has had to change vehicles twice.  He started out with a second-hand car, and with it he managed to save money and eventually buy a new car.

He tells us that everything is going very well in his work. The only difficulty he has is not having his own transportation, which makes the cost of shipping his products very high. During production seasons he mainly works at gathering up products, while his beloved wife is in charge of working their agricultural land with workers that they hire for the season so that they can have a better harvest. Eusebio is happy with the job he does because it gives him good earnings. At the same time, he is not content with it because he is planning to open a restaurant because he has a house near the place where he wants to open it. This is the fourth loan he has had with Microfinanzas Prisma. He pledges, once more, to make his repayments punctually. He is happy with his communal bank because they [the other members] are good people. With the 2,500 PEN he will do maintenance on his agricultural land.

Filomena has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\n\nIn 2012, Filomena re-joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Filomena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD in 'Upolu, the main island.  This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  Filomena is now requesting a new loan for 1,000 WST, which she will use to purchase a box of chicken, sausage, plastic plates, and foil.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD's branch office in Savai'i, where she now lives.

They requested a loan of 250,000 YER from AMB.\r\n\r\nAwtar is 28 years old, a married woman with two children. She is the leader of this group. (In the photo she is on the left, with pink fabric on her shoulder.) She lives in Aden, Yemen. She is a merchant; specifically she sells new clothes for adults and children, according to the season. \r\n\r\nAwtar has been doing this for three years. She sells her products from her house. She buys her merchandise from distributors and stores where the prices are cheaper. She began this activity as a result of the lack of a clothes market in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to her neighbors who supported her over all these years. With the income from her business she was able to upgrade her home and enjoy more comfort. At the present time, her business doesn't get her as much profit due to the bad situation in Yemen.\r\n\r\n So she applied for a youth loan of 50,000 YER from AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, etc. She will sell them to her customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve her income from her business. One of her personal dreams is to send her children to  private  high schools.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1056564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
