His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. They own a plot of land where eggplant, tomatoes and greens are grown. They also have a milk cow and 4 calves. The cows are milked every day to produce dairy products. All the products are sold at the local markets and among the villagers.\r\n\r\nAlekbar requested loan from Credo to start a family business. Alekbar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Alekbar will purchase stocks of groceries and open a grocery shop. He has a commercial space in a populous area, which will help his business to be successful. Family work in the shop themselves in order to decrease the expenses and increase the income.

37-year-old Josen. He is married and has two children, ages 15 and 16, who are both in high school. He runs a mobile money transfer shop in his hometown of Chingola.  When Josen is not at his shop, he can be found at one of the local schools where he serves as a teacher.\r\n\r\nJosen describes his business as the safest way for people to send and receive money from one place to the other. He is requesting a Kiva loan so that he can improve the business by adding more working capital. He explains that the business of money transfers is highly dependent on how much cash and electronic funds one has in the business, and currently he does not have enough money. The lack of money in his business makes him lose out on business as he cannot serve some of his customers, especially the ones that want to transfer large amounts of money.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Josen started, he has employed one person to help him with the day-to-day transactions at his shop. He is hopeful that, once he gets the Kiva loan, his business will improve and he will make more profit. The profit will help Josen to provide for his family and save for his children's college education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":752.9,"image":{"id":1360929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To

With more seeds and fertilizer, borrowers are able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":230.19,"image":{"id":1360909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buys seeds and fertilizers for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalpana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-29T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020269,"comment":null},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-27T08:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381808100,"comment":null},{"amount":29.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":390668163,"comment":null},{"amount":28.24,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.93,"payment_id":400621679,"comment":null},{"amount":28.71,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":410196562,"comment":null},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.08,"payment_id":419960011,"comment":null},{"amount":28.72,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.45,"payment_id":429613904,"comment":null},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.15,"payment_id":439840366,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-28T22:16:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565854,"name":"Ramila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramila is 35 years old.

Many farmers in the area have expressed excitement at the prospect of owning their own hives, and having a second source of income from their honey to help care for their families.  \r\n\r\nFlorence is married and has five children. She and her husband have been farming for 26 years, and are currently tending to an orange grove on their land. Florence is looking forward to working with Honey Care because they provide beekeeping training to all of their farmers. She has also heard that bees can have a positive impact on her crops through pollination, and this makes her even more eager to start beekeeping. \r\n\r\nThis is Florence\u2019s first loan, and she plans to use the income generated from her beehives to pay her children\u2019s school fees. In the future, she hopes to continue to educate her children, so they can provide for themselves and have a comfortable life. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12,"image":{"id":1360958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kwale","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589366,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-28T22:56:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565940,"name":"Dorca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorca is a member of the group called Fe y Esperanza, located in the city of Hato Mayor.

After her last loan, which she invested in her business, she realized the need to improve her home.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a housing loan to improve her home by changing her old roof.

She is running a business of selling groceries the school in her community.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nShe thanks God, Esperanza International and all of you for this opportunity.

Her latest loan was invested in the business, in which she sells cosmetics and beauty products. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown faithfulness in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their businesses and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nAdargisa wants to start building her house with this loan. Her house was built out of deteriorated wood, and she will rebuild it with concrete blocks. Adargisa is requesting this loan to buy cement, concrete blocks, and other building materials. She wishes to have a safe and nice home, as well as to have an improved business. \r\n\r\nRoselia, the other member in this loan will also start building her house with a concrete block structure. She will buy the same building materials but in larger quantities. \r\n\r\nAdargisa and Roselia thank God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity.

He graduated from State Armenian Engineering University but has never worked in that field. After serving in the military, Tigran had the chance to join to his parents in Russia, but as a very patriotic young person, he preferred to stay in his motherland and start his own business in his lovely city, Kapan. Last year Tigran rented a place in Kapan to run an internet and computer service business. His parents initially helped him buy some computers and furniture for his internet caf\u00e9. Now Tigran is very happy and appreciated by his business. Not every person has internet in his or her house in Kapan city, so Tigran has gathered a large number of customers in a short period of time. His main clients are students from Kapan. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan for Tigran with a financial company and he preferred to work with Nor Horizon and Kiva. He decided to expand the services in his internet caf\u00e9 and asks from Kiva a loan of 2,900 USD to buy a new computer, new desks and a printer for his internet caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\nTigran hopes for

Previously, she rented a house with her mother for somewhere to live, as her father abandoned them when they were very young. \r\n\r\nThis is how, alongside her mother, she began growing corn, beans and millet. She also made sleeping mats and, because of their poverty she learned to make chicken, pork and bread tamales to sell in their community. Aged 15 she started a relationship and had 8 children, but her partner left her and the children. She has had to work hard to feed them. Her children support her a lot and with hard work they have bought some land to build a house near to town. She owns pigs that are ready to be slaughtered and 15 years ago she set up a small shop, which gives them lots of income and she always grows corn and beans. She gets the merchandise for her shop, such as agricultural supplies in the city, which is half an hour drive from her home in a private car as there is no public transport where she lives.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting, is to buy manure, fertilisers and to pay for the rent on the land where she grows corn and beans. With this investment she will buy seasonal supplies in the right quantities to acquire a good harvest so that she can be sure of feeding her family. With the income she wants to save in orders to make some repairs to their home and in future to buy a vehicle so she can sell to remote neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":234.12,"image":{"id":1361040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilisers and to pay rent on the land where she grows corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-05-28T20:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-27T20:50:09Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":230.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":269.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":234.12,"local_amount":234.12,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":234.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505020,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-30T05:18:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565951,"name":"Wendy Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wendy tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada y tiene 4 hijos.

","en":"Zoir is a young and good-natured 32 year old man. He is married and has three children. Zoir married early and didn't attend college to receive a professional degree. Instead he is making a living with the trade he learned from his father. Since childhood Zoir has helped his father in the fields. Now Zoir has a small farm where he grows cotton for sale. The cotton sales provide him and his family with a good income. Zoir owns a field of 1.5 hectares where he grows not only cotton but also onions and other crops. Zoir's wife also continue the trade she learned from her mother as a child. She raises livestock, and sells them, their meat and their milk at the market. Livestock business provides the family with additional income. Currently Zoir's family owns one cow, but he wants his wife to expand the herd so that the family will have a more stable source of income.

Both of her children are studying in government schools. \r\n\r\nAfshan is an efficient beautician, by profession. Since 2004, she has been operating her own beauty salon. Currently, the beauty stock of the salon is almost finished, therefore Afshan wants to purchase cosmetic products to continue her business. \r\n\r\nFor that purpose, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to purchase beauty products, like facial creams, lipsticks, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors, and some other varieties of products. She would also buy some new chairs for her salon. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she will pay the installments of the loan and school fees for her children. She dreams to live a happy, healthy, and peaceful life with her family. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

She is using her tailoring skills to generate an alternative source of income for her family. She is very experienced in stitching clothes and dresses. She has been doing this work for twenty years. Her clients are very happy and well satisfied with her work. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan, to expand her business. She wants to open a tailoring centre in her house. She would purchase two new sewing machines so that her production would be increased. She would also purchase some thread and cloth for stitching purposes. \r\n\r\nNoorjana would pay her installments with the profit amount and also pay some household expenses.

resides in Nkubu, the Meru region of Eastern Kenya.  This is a very fertile area situated at the slopes of Mt. Kenya.  She is a single mother of two children who has been practicing farming for five years.

Marina requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two pigs and walnut trees. They sell the harvested walnuts locally at a good price but it is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Marina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With this credit, Marina will purchase two milking cows. After purchasing milking cows, she will be able to produce dairy products to sell. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":276.26,"image":{"id":1361357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two milking cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kachaeti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T03:10:04Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.85},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.53},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.05},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.42},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.4},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.31},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.14,"local_amount":58.38,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":59.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613683,"comment":null},{"amount":45.1,"local_amount":72.85,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":73.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857396,"comment":null},{"amount":46.32,"local_amount":74.83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134044,"comment":null},{"amount":48.61,"local_amount":78.53,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":79.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107634,"comment":null},{"amount":48.91,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":80.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255175,"comment":null},{"amount":51.18,"local_amount":82.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-07T21:01:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566122,"name":"Adi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adi, 38, is a builder who does home construction and makes home facilities.

They have a vineyard. They pick the grapes and Manana produces \u2018Churchkhela,\u2019 a Georgian delicacy prepared from grapes strung on a thread in the nut flour thickened grape juice, to sell. It is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Manana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Manana will open a bakery. After the bakery is opened, they will bake Georgian bread. This will increase the income of their family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":407.49,"image":{"id":1361368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to open a bakery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Manavi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T03:30:03Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":124.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":126.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":130.74},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":139.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149.47},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":155.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":165.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176.41},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.58},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.37},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":79.97,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":81.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613685,"comment":null},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":107.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":108.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857398,"comment":null},{"amount":68.62,"local_amount":110.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":112.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134046,"comment":null},{"amount":72.4,"local_amount":116.78,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:21Z","rounded_local_amount":118.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107636,"comment":null},{"amount":73.36,"local_amount":118.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":120.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255177,"comment":null},{"amount":77.15,"local_amount":124.43,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019315,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-30T10:11:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566131,"name":"Rafia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rafia is 42 years old and lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her family.

For that purpose Razia has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. She is hopeful that the loan will be productive for her business. With the profit, she wants to construct her own house.

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband and four sons. Her husband is a security guard. His income is not enough to meet the household expenses. \r\n\r\nFor eight years, Rani has been running a beauty salon. She wants to purchase more cosmetic products, such as makeup kits, facial scrubs, and nail polish, and chairs for her beauty salon. For that reason, Rani has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner, BRAC Pakistan.

Actualmente vive en Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta peque\u00f1a ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nMarco es un hombre emprendedor siempre se ha desempe\u00f1ado muy bien en el campo comercial, hace 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 invertir en la compra de un juego inflable a motor que entretiene a los ni\u00f1os y lo alquila por tiempos determinados  en las plazas y parques donde se ubica con la esperanza de conseguir el sustento diario. Invierte 10 horas cada d\u00eda en la preparaci\u00f3n, limpieza, mantenimiento y recorrido de parques infantiles en donde encuentra demanda del juego. Esta actividad se la ense\u00f1\u00f3 un cu\u00f1ado quien lo gui\u00f3 para la compra y administraci\u00f3n del negocio. \nMarco ha estudiado la posibilidad de ofrecer otros productos mientras transcurren los periodos en los cuales los ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n jugando, entre estos productos ha visto la factibilidad de vender dulces, manzanas, caramelos, chicles, chocolates, etc., con lo cual sus ingresos aumentar\u00e1n y de este modo \u00e9l podr\u00e1 mejorar su calidad. Para poder hacer realidad este paso de emprendimiento, Marco solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 exclusivamente en su negocio, mantenimiento y ampliaci\u00f3n, por lo cual motiva a todas aquellas personas alrededor del mundo que quieran ser parte de este sue\u00f1o a aportar con su emprendimiento y agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes en busca de mejorar la calidad de vida de sus clientes, han abierto las puertas a la microempresa para desarrollarse y crecer. ","en":"Marco is 25 years old and was born in the Amazon rain forest in Ecuador.  Here, there are very few opportunities to study and Marco barely finished primary school, though there he did learn the basic skills that help him in his life as a businessman.  Marco currently lives in Pastaza, one of the cantons of the Pastaza province.  This is part of the Amazon Region in the Republic of Ecuador.  The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, in the west of the Pastaza province and at 924 metres above sea level.  The area is not hugely populated but there are a number of sites that are enjoyed by both domestic and international tourists, particularly in ecological and extreme sports tourism.  This is a city whose economy is growing every day in various business sectors, including cattle raising, agriculture and tourism.  Financial and commercial businesses have set up branch offices here in order to take advantage of the lively economy that the city has.  In every business, you can find people who do not give up even in face of a lack of jobs.  Instead of giving up, people create their own businesses in order to have a decent life and make their dreams a reality.\r\nMarco is enterprising and has always worked well in business.  Five years ago he decided to invest in a children\u2019s bouncy castle and he rents it out for specific time periods in the main squares and parks.  He sets-up there hoping to earn a living.  Marco spends ten hours each day preparing, cleaning, maintaining and travelling to and from children\u2019s parks where there is demand for the bouncy castle.  Marco was taught how to set up and run this business by one of his brothers-in-law.\r\nMarco has looked at the possibility of offering other products to sell while children are playing.  Among these products he has found he could sell sweets, apples, chewing gum, chocolates and such like.  By doing this his income would increase and he would be able to improve his quality of life.  In order to turn this idea into a reality, Marco is applying for a loan to invest exclusively in his business \u2013 to look after and expand it.  So, he encourages all those around the world who would like to be a part of his dream to participate and he thanks \u201cFundaci\u00f3n Alternativa\u201d who are working to improve their borrowers quality of life.  They have opened doors for microfinance projects to develop and grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":741.29,"image":{"id":1361094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to

For the past five years she has been operating a table market where she sells rice, bitter-ball, pepper, okra, etc in the local market. She started this business with money given to her by her fiancee and enjoys her business because it gives her more money.  \r\n\r\nShe sells six days a week, from 7am to 5pm, and most of the time she uses the bus to get her goods to her spot. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rice, bitter-ball, pepper, okra, etc for her business, and her plan is to build a house and educate her children.

is a 30-year-old married lady who has been running a small general store in her community for many years. She offers a variety of grocery items at reasonable prices and has retained many customers who regularly shop at her store.

Good roads, access to clean water, affordable rents and plentiful transportation options make Paynesville South one of the most popular places to live. Fatu is married and has six children, between the ages of 1 and 18. Five of her children are attending school, and they all live with her in her home. She runs a business selling items such as rice, oil, pepper, Vita juice and onions from a market table. She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business two years ago, using money given to her by her husband. Typically, she works at her business from 7 AM to 4 PM, Monday to Saturday. She transports her goods to her business by bus. She cites her greatest challenge as a shortage of capital. She is proud of her business because it supports her household.

lives in the Kisii area of Kenya, which is a primary banana and sugar cane-growing region. She has two children and has been doing farming for 12 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"Digging.\" Her biggest challenges are: \"Climate change and disease.\" Animals on the farm have been given the names of: \"Nyota.\"\r\n\r\nAlice was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"Assisted her to buy a cow.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi Kilimo's required microfinance training session: \"Benefits of microfinances.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit her family?,\" Alice replied: \"Will increase milk production.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi Kilimo's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

Currently he produces butternut squash, green peppers, and cucumbers. He has even found a buyer at a major market in the capital city who wants to purchase large quantities of watermelons. Unfortunately, without his own pump, Trust is unable to meet this demand.\n \nEquipment such as a water pump can be a major boost for many vegetable farmers such as Trust, as it allows for increased production and more predictable yields due to irrigation. Unfortunately, the upfront cost of productive equipment such as water pumps can be prohibitive, forcing many to do the labor-intensive task of watering by hand, or through occasionally hiring a pump. Once Trust secures a loan, he will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nWith a pump Trust will be able to increase his production and even expand into growing different crops. The use of a pump will also mean that he can irrigate a larger portion of land in less time and not be restricted by the labor-intensive task of carrying water by hand to his field. Trust is eager to expand his production so that he can effectively supply the larger markets in Lusaka, the capital city.\n \nIt is for this reason Trust is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a water pump as soon as possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1361631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for a water pump kit that will be used for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Trust","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410397980,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962076,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616064,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T20:03:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566332,"name":"Leily Lizeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leily, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en uni\u00f3n libre con su conyugue con quien tiene una hija, reside en el municipio de Puerto Cortes.

The use of a pump will also mean that he can irrigate a larger portion of land in less time and even be able to experiment with new crops.\n \nRoy added that after he obtains a water pump he would like to start growing melons, which require more water but are very popular in the region.\n \nIt is for this reason Roy is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1361801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for a water pump kit for irrigation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":2610,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410397981,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962077,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":870,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616065,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T22:05:59Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:57:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566575,"name":"Tiessiri  Iv Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les dix  membres du groupe TIESSIRI  IV sont des femmes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 44 ans et ont en moyenne 5 enfants.

Silvia is the President of the group. She is 46 years-old and has eight children. Three years ago, Sylvia started a small business which is a convenience store.

She happily informed us that the business is doing quite well!\r\n\r\nSilvia has requested a new loan (which would be her third loan cycle) of $410 in order to purchase a refrigerator. Her clients have requested cold products such as dairy products (yogurt, cheese, cream) and she plans on making ice cream! She will also sell meat. Sylvia has had no difficulty in making her payments on previous loans. She has a well-thought out business plan and has learned a great deal about business administration as it is one of the educational themes covered in the monthly meetings of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank. A few of the other themes include self-esteem, health, diet and women\u2019s issues.\r\n\r\nSylvia and her fellow Trust Bank members appreciate having access to small loans and education.

Nancy sells undergarments, such as boxers and knickers, which she either makes herself or sometimes buys from wholesalers to sell to her customers. She also sells cosmetics and personal hygiene products through a catalogue. At her house, there is a small space dedicated to her business, where she shows her customers the products she has for sale, such as perfume, talcum powder, moisturiser, or accessories. Nancy has been in business for nearly a year now, works alone and earns a decent living at it. She plans to keep in this line of business, since she likes it, not in the least because she has a solid customer base already, which enables her to have a somewhat steady income.

business owner, Herbert has owned and operated Boyce Suprette Grocery Store in Boyce, Louisiana for more than 25 years.  His retail grocery store offers the community fresh and high-quality items at a low everyday price.  At his grocery, you can find just about anything, whether you are in the mood for a quick snack or preparing a meal for your family.  \r\n\r\nHerbert came across Accion Texas Inc. while at the Small Business Development Center in Louisiana.  He was referred to Accion and approved to receive a loan, which allowed him to continue to pay his four full-time and two part-time employees, maintain a cash reserve for emergencies, purchase food for stock, and pay for the delivery services of the items.  \r\n\r\nHerbert thanks his church for spreading the good word about his business and his friends from the community for promoting his store daily by word of mouth.  Herbert creates flyers to post around the community to help with advertising, too.  These many tactics, along with his Accion loan, have given the store a boost. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Herbert plans to hire one additional full and part-time employee to assist with the business and continue to be the best local grocer in his community.  \u201cHaving money available for emergencies and staff without sacrificing is a big help,\u201d said Herbert.   \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1361626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to continue to pay his four full-time and two part-time employees, maintain a cash reserve for emergencies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Boyce, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.99},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.47},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.54},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.81},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":223.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566338,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Please meet 45-year-old Victoria from Paynesville North in Liberia.

When she turned 17, her father wanted Vivian to have a better education than could be provided in their country, so he paid for her to attend college in the United States.  After graduation, she became a writer and self-publisher.\r\n\r\n\u201cLooking at how successful he was, I wanted to do the same,\u201d she says about her father.  She received her degree from a Florida university, moved to Texas in 2007 where she published books while working remotely as a merchandise consultant in Chicago, and now resides in Houston where she decided to take on her newest challenge.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to design and manufacture African textile fabric in the U.S. and then sell it online.  This type of fabric, known as Ankara, is a wax fabric used mostly for African dresses. Today, it\u2019s also used for handbags, shoes, and even men\u2019s clothing. Vivian creates the designs and her business partner works with wholesale distributors.\r\n\r\nInspired by coral reef fish she saw on TV, Vivian says she spent a year trying to find Ankara fabric with the same vibrant colors and designs, but could not find anything similar.  Vivian says her interest this fabric started at a very young age, based on what she learned from her mother, who tie-dyed Ankaras,\r\n\r\nSince going into business for herself, she has developed two collections totaling 800 designs: one artistic line with designs inspired by music, African lands and the coral reef; the other a premium line filled with colors and symbols made with more fabric.\r\n\r\nWith her plan in mind, Vivian needed funds to get her business moving. She says she doesn\u2019t remember exactly how she found out about Accion Texas Inc. but she does remember filling out the application. She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d call me back \u2013 I just filled it out.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer dream is to re-open a textile mill in Houston to work in.  For now, Vivian is using her funds to manufacture one of her designs and use those profits to grow the company. The loan will help market the first design, Vivian says. She believes that her textile Ankaras will become one of the most produced fabrics in the U.S.--and thanked Accion for its help.\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you for taking a chance on us,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout the loan, I would not have enough money to get the first design completed.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1224.29,"image":{"id":1361805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to

was a drug addict for nearly half a century.  He lost his family, home, car and job and was left wandering the streets of San Antonio, homeless, with only a backpack of clothes to his name.  \r\n\r\nBefore changing his life around, his daily routine consisted of doing drugs, going to work without drugs, and then returning home to do more drugs.  \r\n\r\nNow 59, Michael is at last sober.  And he owns a business.  And he\u2019s even creating jobs for others.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s God\u2019s will. I\u2019m lucky to be alive,\u201d he proclaims.\r\n\r\nHe started his business, MKH Construction, in June 2012.  Within two months he had contracted 10 projects simply by word of mouth.  And the business has continued to grow.  He repairs homes to make them presentable for leasing. As Michael tells it, some tenants are not gentle on their properties, so landlords contract with him to fix, repair, or replace balconies, air and light fixtures and flooring.\r\n\r\nMichael normally works on homes in Cibolo, Schertz and Converse, Texas. His business employs four to five residents of Haven for Hope, a transitional living campus for the homeless in San Antonio \u2013 where he also spent time getting his life back together.\r\n\r\nMichael has been in the construction industry since he was 17 when he took his first roofing job in California. From there, he worked for a general contractor, who only hired workers who knew how to do everything to fix a house.  While living at Haven for Hope, Michael contemplated working for the national do-it-yourself chain Home Depot--until he attended a day class on construction. \u201cI was bored and had nothing to do, so I volunteered to work with the instructor, and he saw I knew a little more than him,\u201d Michael said.\r\n\r\nThat instructor introduced Michael to Accion Texas, Inc., allowing him to become the first Haven for Hope resident to receive a loan.  Michael returned to Accion nine months later to purchase equipment. \u201cI\u2019m running an honest job. What\u2019s different about me is that I buy all materials and I don\u2019t collect until the project is complete,\u201d he says proudly.  \u201cThe loan enabled me to buy tools that will help me do an even better job for my clients.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1199,"image":{"id":1361886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to

Tuvshinmandakh, 35 years old, lives with her family in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional 'ger' (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. She has been working as a miner at a mining company for two years. He husband has the position of marketing manager at a restaurant.\r\n\r\n Even though they have a house on their land, they live in a Mongolian traditional ger since the house has vulnerable windows, walls and roofs. But recently they decided to move into their house because as winter comes, the ger couldn't afford comfortable and warm accommodation due to its long-time usage. So Mrs. Tuvshinmandakh is requesting a loan of 7,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, vacuum-insulated windows, hardwood floors, shingles, fiberglass, cotton and gypsum.\r\n\r\n Using those materials, she and her husband will repair and insulate their house.

She also sells clothes on the side. What she likes about her work is that it still leaves her with some spare time to have another business. Fortunately, her business is going very well, and she never lacks customers, thanks to the wide variety of products on offer and to being the only store selling alcohol in her neighbourhood. Kerly hopes to continue growing and to improve her business. She asks for a loan of 1,500 soles and is very happy for the opportunity, since it will help her reach her goals. She will use the money to buy rice, sugar, bread, eggs, milk, and cooking oil."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1361732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy groceries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kerly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":229.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":238.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":256.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":265.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":272.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":179.45,"local_amount":468.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":480.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975744,"comment":null},{"amount":91.02,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":243.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997012,"comment":null},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":256.09,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":263.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864482,"comment":null},{"amount":101.83,"local_amount":265.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":272.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352850,"comment":null},{"amount":104.53,"local_amount":272.69,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":280.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904620,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-31T15:19:02Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566458,"name":"Joana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joana is 53 years old and she is now applying for a loan of $1.200 to improve her business.

Together they are a family alongside their four children.  Thanks to various years working with her husband, Catalina now has a home built of bricks and cement.  Catalina has now been working in the fields for seventeen years, growing organic cacao.  She has a plot of land that she inherited from her grandparents when she was young and it has helped her to earn an income to support her family.  In order to obtain a good quality product, Catalina uses organic fertiliser that she buys from one of the area's biggest distributors.  Catalina is dedicated to her work and so is different from other producers in the area.  She only takes on labourers from the area for harvest.  After the harvest she dries the fruit and sells it to buyers in area, the price varying according to the quality of the product.  This sale allows her to earn back the money she has invested.  Catalina's main goal is to work with motivation so as to provide financial support to her younger children and send them to study in the city.  This is Catalina's third loan from Kiva and she is grateful for the opportunity she is receiving that will help her to prosper.  Catalina is applying for a loan of 1000 Nuevo Soles to buy organic fertiliser and to improve the quality of her plants."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.56,"image":{"id":1361773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-29T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-28T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.36,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975746,"comment":null},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":91.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997014,"comment":null},{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":94.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864484,"comment":null},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352852,"comment":null},{"amount":37.66,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904622,"comment":null},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":103.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090639,"comment":null},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":103.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777343,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-29T22:41:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566464,"name":"Pichmeamveasna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pichmeamveasna (pictured here), age 20, is single and lives with his parents and sister in Phnom Penh.
