is 23 years old and lives with his sister and brother-in-law in a rented one-room apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Since 2010, he has been working as a petroleum tank truck driver for a fuel company. His sister is a student and will finish her university studies in the coming spring. His brother-in-law works as an assistant worker in a chain store. Oyunbaatar and his family have been renting their apartment for the last three years. In August of this year, they decided to buy a plot of land in a boundary area of the city and to build a 64-square-meter house with less energy consumption compared to usual wooden houses. The house-building process is going as well as planned. Now, they have laid the foundation and bricked up the two-side wall of the house with block. Adding the roof, completing the walls, and decorating the interior still need to be done. Oyunbaatar is asking for a 5,000,000 MNT loan to complete his house and install an electric floor heater in order to reduce coal usage. By doing this he and his family will live in their own house and contribute their efforts to save the environment.

For the past year, Jenniffer has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells general household goods like rice and baking flour. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jenniffer has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more stock like sugar, cooking oil and soap for resale. It will help her to generate greater profits, cover her basic needs like food, and add more unique items to her stock. Jenniffer hopes that in the future, she will be able to own a salon. \r\n\r\nJenniffer is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills

This was called the tragedy of Ontranto. Their dead bodies were never found. For a long time, Mark grieved yet he had to raise all the children on his own, including very young children and a little a baby. According to him, he found all the strength from prayers.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to feed his children and cover their expenses, Mark started running a business of livestock, buying and raising goats and cows and selling dairy products. \r\n\r\nMark is now requesting a loan to build a stable for the animals before winter, and he stresses on the urgency of it.

To help expand her business, Lydia has requested a loan for 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to buy more medicines and a scanning machine that she can use in the pharmacy. This loan will help Lydia generate greater profits and pay her sister's school fees. Her goal for the future is to continue to expand her business. She is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and offers a forum for life-skills

lives in Changamwe, Kenya. He is a married father of two school going children. He runs a bureau which has been in operation for five years.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

originally from Brazil, works full time as a cook in a Brazilian restaurant but has always been passionate about journalism. Mario noticed that the Brazilian community had limited access to information and news in their own language, so he decided to create Manchete USA, an online newspaper available in Brazilian Portuguese. \r\n\r\nThe website features news from Brazil, the world, U.S. politics, immigration issues and updates, sports and news about the Brazilian Community in the U.S. Mario loves his work, but he really enjoys watching his community engage with his articles. \r\n\r\nFor Mario, the biggest challenge for Manchete USA is getting the world out about a young newspaper. This is why he is currently working on branding his business to attract more readers, more advertising and more website traffic. One of his tactics has been to gather local restaurants and businesses as sponsors to  support the newspaper by offering coupons on his website. \r\n\r\nMario is asking for a loan to purchase a new computer, a professional camera and a new printer.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nFatima runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Fatima\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special items are displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day.\n \nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy additional used quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nFatima hopes to give her children a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and it is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nNaima runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Naima\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Yolanda\u2019s stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \n\nTo help her expand the business, Naima is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nNaima hopes to give her children a good future and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is part of the group, El Esfuerzo (The Effort), and she says that they gave the group this name because with much effort they are raising their families. She relates that more than 20 years ago she and her husband created their own business to raise their children and also to provide employment. She makes various articles of wood, such as balusters, wooden boxes for fruit, railings, handrails, etc. Guillermina says that she is applying for a loan to purchase brushes for different types of finishes, varnish and sandpaper to polish the wood, nails, and glue, and that she will buy her supplies in the city of Toluca in stores that specialize in wood. She also says that they take the wood to their house, where they make all their creations, and that now what their customers have been asking for most is boxes for avocados, and that since there are already a  number of producers of this fruit, they have placed orders, and this is why they are asking for the loan, to stock a little more wood and begin to make them, because the customers are anxious to get them, and she hopes that with the loan that they are asking for they will have enough. Guillermina says \"I hope that this request goes well for us to continue making more boxes in bulk. I hope to advance because now I have very substantial expenses with one of my 'kids' who is now in high school, and this is why I am working really hard to help my husband with the expenses, and this is why I am committed to the loan.\r\n\r\nThe other 14 people in the group are Yolanda, Consuelo, Maria Clara, Carolina, Maria Isabel, Rosalinda, Guadalupe, Flor de Maria, Maria Isaura, Manuela, Aurelia, Carolina, Juan Carlos, and Angelina. They will invest their loans in repairs for a taxi, to purchase basic ingredients to make churros, to buy fabric, thread, and needles to make clothing, to purchase ingredients to make Mexican snacks, to purchase cosmetics and sell them on installment plans, and to stock a grocery

And three years later, they will get the cars.  Before these, they got two cars from a taxi service company and sold them. \r\n\r\nWith the money, they bought a plot of land in the remote area of the city and built their house on it.  In winter, her house loses its heat through the door and gets colder, so she needs to use a coal stove to stay warm. Coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia. So Narantuya is requesting MNT 2,000,000 loan to build a small barn where the house door meets the outside. \r\n\r\nBy doing this, her house can reduce the heat loss, and she will burn less coal, and her family will live in a comfortable condition.

For the past two years, Mosaab has been operating a workshop repairing electrical generators, and selling spare parts. It has been a profitable project, and the only source of income to him, but also needs more support to cover the cost.\n\nMosaab is looking to provide his customers with better quality, so he is requesting a USD loan from FATEN in order to help him cover the cost of purchasing new repair kit. This will enable Mosaab to improve the quality of his work, and take less time in repairing the electrical generators, which will lead to customer satisfaction and improve his income. Mosaab's photo is in his workshop.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

his dad transform his carpentry hobby into a contracting business helped inspire 10-year-old Greg\u2019s dream to one day own a business. When he grew up \u2013 turning 29 this past summer \u2013 Greg realized his dream by merging his love for cycling with the transportation industry to create a taxi service called Little Rock Pedicab in Little Rock, Arkansas.\r\n\r\nGreg took four months to put his thoughts together, order bikes, purchase insurance, and become licensed; he\u2019s currently waiting on inspections to approve the bikes before he can completely operate. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m trying to process is making sure it\u2019s a safe and enjoyable ride,\u201d Greg says. \u201cI just want people to enjoy themselves and not be concerned about the ride.\u201d \r\n\r\nHe also carefully researched the pedicab industry to be certain he made the safest cabs possible.  For example, when he discovered many bicycle wrecks were reported because trolley tracks are wide enough for bicycle tires to get stuck between, Greg outfitted his pedicabs with wider motorcycle tires that can\u2019t get stuck.  He also learned that Arkansas come in last among the United States when it comes to bicycle participation \u2013 so he is now on a mission to improve that rating.\r\n\r\nGreg\u2019s pedicabs carry up to 700 pounds and have a top speed of about 20 miles per hour.  However, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be going that fast. \u201cWhen you take your time getting somewhere, you actually get to see the world around you and really enjoy it,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Greg employs himself and rents to a handful of subcontractors who serve as drivers.  He hopes to grow a demand for pedicabs in Little Rock and then expand, but he says he would not be at this point in his business had he not received a loan from Accion Texas Inc.  While looking into lenders, Greg found the majority of them required a business owner to already be in business before they were considered for a loan. Accion was one of the only lenders he found that assisted start-up businesses. \r\n\r\nThe majority of his loan went to purchase the pedicabs, the rest went to insurance and other start-up costs.  \u201cThe Accion Texas loan really started the process of owning my own business. Without it, I wouldn\u2019t have started my business now.  I would have had to wait for years, because most lenders wouldn\u2019t lend to beginners.\u201d\r\n\r\nGreg says, \u201cThanks to Accion for helping me accomplish the dream I had since I was a kid. Traditional banks didn\u2019t believe in me, but talking to people at Accion made me feel that they believed in me, the person behind the business. Thanks for believing.\u201d \r\n\r\nFind out more about Greg\u2019s business at his Website: http:\/\/lrpedicab.com\/; Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LittleRockPedicab; and Twitter page:

March 2012, Aida and Tom have been the proud owners of Cafe Manhattan, a small coffee shop in San Diego\u2019s North County. \r\n\r\nLocated next to the town's car wash, the coffee shop and caf\u00e9 has a steady stream of hungry clientele who praise Cafe Manhattan for their fresh coffee and delicious crepes. These delicacies are stuffed with fresh ingredients such as baby spinach, applewood smoked bacon and Swiss cheese, while desert crepes are made with melted chocolate ganache or fresh lemon juice. They also serve fine paninis and fresh fruit smoothies. \r\n\r\nCafe Manhattan is a family-run business. Their daughter often helps out in the business, and Aida and Tom enjoy the flexibility they now have to spend time as a family.  They also love interacting with their loyal customer base.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling with their revenue during the recession, Tom and Aida are looking to secure a stable income stream for their shop. Tom also works as a real estate agent to supplement the family's income, which is also why he was not present when the picture was taken.\r\n\r\nThey will use their $8,100 Kiva loan to purchase new equipment such as an oven hood, increase menu options and better serve their clients. As their business grows, they hope to someday open a second location.\r\n\r\nFind Cafe Manhattan on Facebook: www.facebook.com\/CafeManhattanEncinitas

For the past 2 years, Sarah has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and paying her house rent and buying food for her famiy. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to own another salon. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She is wearing a purple sweatshirt and black sweat pants with white stripes. Her hair is dark brown and wears it tied up. \r\n\r\nShe is engaged in fast food for one month. She says she works Monday through Saturday in an establishment near her home. She works alone and her schedule is distributed according to her availability. She sells steaks, hot dogs and French fries.

Respecto a las capacitaciones impartidas en las reuniones, ha aprendido administrar su negocio de mejor manera.\nTalca pertenece a la regi\u00f3n del Maule, ubicada en la zona centro del pa\u00eds. Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n","en":"The Uni\u00f3n y Esperanza community bank is made up of 17 entrepreneurs who work in different areas including: street vendor, sales at a market stall, sales at a bazaar, department store, vegetable sales, bread sales, household goods sales, services, and others.  They all live in the city of Talca.  \r\n\r\nMarjorie is a member of the group.  In the photo, she is standing in the back row in the first spot from right to left.  Her dark brown hair is worn down.  She has worked as a street vendor for ten years.  She works from Monday to Saturday and sometimes works during festivals and other times at high schools and gardens offering her merchandise to adults and children.  She purchases her merchandise in the city of Santiago where there she can purchase items at wholesale and find a large variety of products at low cost, which is convenient economically.  She will use the loan to purchase bazaar items such as earrings, rings, headbands, and clothing such as hosiery and underwear.  One of Marjorie's goals is to have a bazaar in her home so that she can attend to her customers more calmly and show all of her merchandise and generate more income so that she can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMarjorie lives with her husband and their four children who are 3, 5, 10, and 12 years old.  Her dream for her business is to have her bazaar, and her dreams for her family are that her children do well and have a good future so that they can get a good job after their studies.  She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has provided since it has allowed her to invest in her business.  She feels very comfortable with the company of the other entrepreneurs in her community bank since they share different activities and interests which have served as a moment of distraction.  She has learned how to administer her business better in the trainings provided at meetings.  \r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region, which is located in the central part of the country.  It is the administrative, economic, and culture center of the region and the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  In Chile there is a curious reference to Talca in the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London\". Some say this is a derivation of the original phrase spoken by an Englishman, \"Talca seems like London\" because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3625,"image":{"id":1227478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

For that she has faced many obstacles, such as having to take her children to class with her because she didn't have anyone to watch them. Thankfully, she's in the final stages of her career.

group and is the group\u2019s leader. Turgungubu is 44 years old; her husband died prematurely in 2008. Turgungubu has brought up four children. Now she has two school-age children in her care. Her eldest son is married and works in Russia. Turgungbubu has received secondary education. After finishing high school, she got married.  When the collective farm system was dissolved and she received a land plot, she started growing produce. At present the family continues to grow produce and raise livestock; they work 1,85 ha [about 4,5 acres] of land. Turgunbubu is a very active and hard-working person by nature. Having to face many challenges on her own after her husband\u2019s death, Turgunbubu  persevered thanks to remaining goal-oriented and calm. Turgunbubu has turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS intended to buy livestock. In the future, Turgunbubu plans to expand her livestock and improve her family\u2019s live conditions. Her goal in life is to raise children and grandchildren, making sure her children receive a good secondary education and later on have an opportunity for university studies.

She comments that they named their group thus because they feel bees are very intelligent, hardworking little animals and that\u2019s why they chose that name for their group.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s married to Edgar who is a carpenter and they have three children who she says are her joy and the reason to move forward.  She relates that she has a business manufacturing furniture like bedroom sets, tables, chairs, dining room sets, chests of drawers, armoires and many other things she makes and sells.  She relates that her husband taught her how to cut, sand and paint the wood and to sell them in a locale they have alongside a highway.  She says that she\u2019s had the business about 8 years and thanks to it she and her family have been able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe says that the wood she uses to make the furniture is delivered to her workshop and the wood she uses the most is pine and conglomerate (pressed sawdust).  She says that she and her husband sell the furniture in a locale and sometimes she goes out to sell it in communities adjacent to her town on credit so that customers can afford to make the payments.\r\n\r\nShe says that she\u2019s asking Vision Fund for a loan to buy varnish they apply to the furniture which is what they most need right now because she currently has several pieces of furniture still unvarnished for lack of capital because sometimes her customers don\u2019t follow through with their payments and she does not have the wherewithal to buy supplies.\r\n\r\nCristina\u2019s goal is to make her business grow.  She says that she\u2019d like her business to grow so that when she\u2019s no longer here she can leave her children a stable business.  \r\n\r\nThe other eleven group members are called Elizabeth, Rosa, Mariana, Jorge, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana de Jes\u00fas, Teresa, Georgina, Nubia, Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Jaime.

\n","en":"This group is called \u201cLas Conchitas\u201d.  They identify themselves with this name because the members are from the Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood, which they celebrate during the month of June.\r\n\r\nBlanca Luz is the one who was interviewed.  She was born in Cop\u00ednala in the month of August in 1951.  She attended school until the third year of high school.  She got married when she was 17, and she has four children, who are all now married.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to her food business.  She has been working in the business for nine years and two months.  She says that it is going well for her because she, herself, goes out and takes orders to sell and deliver to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe started this business activity because she also likes to contribute income to her household.  This way she helps with some of the expenses that are generated daily.  She is a single woman, and she depends solely upon her business.\r\n\r\nHer motive for this business activity is to have her own money.  Her husband was in bad health, and he could no longer work.  That is why she decided to devote her time to something that left her with income.  What she wishes is to manage to get ahead in her business as long as God gives her life.  She wants to use the income that she is getting to improve the place where she sells.\r\n\r\nThe people who comprise the group are:  \r\n\r\nLorena del Carmen:  Will invest in buying and selling soft drinks\r\nSandra:  Will invest in buying materials for her beauty salon\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":1226230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies for making food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-29T00:30:20Z","loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena  Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":497.56,"local_amount":6426.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6474.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120080,"comment":null},{"amount":720.05,"local_amount":9300.63,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":9370.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068126,"comment":null},{"amount":480.34,"local_amount":6204.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":6250.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284864,"comment":null},{"amount":480.5,"local_amount":6206.42,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6252.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199157,"comment":null},{"amount":221.55,"local_amount":2861.71,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T10:48:54Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489778,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 34 years old, married and supports a family of six dependents.

this microfinance organization and is made up of three women who speak the Zoque language and live in a community called San Isidro. Ms. Paulina, who completed the interview, is 36 years-old and was born in the village of Ocotepec. She only completed elementary school and got married to Alberto when she was 15 years-old. They have four children, who are still dependent on them. Paulina invested her last loan in raising poultry, but that didn't earn her a good enough return. That's why she's now planning to invest this loan in a snack food enterprise, and thus be able to put the investment to better use. She was inspired to go into this line of business by her mother, who has been urging her to commit to a trade that can earn her a better income and has offered her a small spot from where she can start selling her foods. Paulina's dream is to be able to go on working and save up to buy materials for putting a roof on her family's house. The other members of the group are Ms. Marcelina, who will invest in some plastic goods, and Mr. Florida who will invest in buying and selling clothing. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1226231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for preparing food items.

Besides producing sugar, Jesman also buys it from another distributor and then resells it on another island.  Unfortunately, Jesman could not continue the business as he had very limited capital to support its operation. Therefore he has requested a loan from TLM for IDR 6,500,000 to buy liquid palm sugar and to expand his business by buying young cattle to be fattened.  He is optimistic that the business would have a favorable effect on his

She is married to Federico, who is a day laborer, and they have 2 children.  One of their children is in high school and the other attends middle school.  Amulfa belongs to the communal bank named \"Un Nuevo Resplandor\" (A New Radiance).  She says that they gave the group this name because the loans have really helped them out a lot.  She says \"thanks to the Vision Fund, my business and the businesses of my fellow group members have improved because we have capital to invest and put to work.  This way we can pay off the loan and also improve conditions for our families.  I thank the lender in the name of my companions and myself for helping us.\"  \r\n\r\nAmulfa says that she has been making embroidered garments for 12 years.  She started out making napkins, but later the people in her town were seeing the pretty things she was making, and how well-embroidered they were, and they started making orders with her.  She decided to start to sell in her town, and then later she was selling in the markets in the communities surrounding her town.  In addition, she raises turkeys and sheep.  \r\n\r\nAmulfa says that she is requesting a loan from Vision Fund to  buy material such as marquesa fabric, embroidery hoops, needles, ribbons, yarn, thread, hooks and thick yarn to make scarves, hats, and other knitted items for the winter season.  This is when she sells the most of these types of garments.  She says that a year ago, she made winter garments and the sales were very good, especially the sets of scarves, hats and gloves.  She says that she buys her raw materials in different stores in a nearby town.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are named Feliciana, Maria Marcela, and Pascacia.

Every day, Yamrid hauls passengers and also agricultural products to be sold in the city. Recently, Yamrid had an idea to buy all these products from his passengers and resell them in the market. It can help the passengers to reduce their transportation cost while helping him earn more income. To get the loan assistance, Yamrid went to TLM and requested a loan of IDR. 5,000,000.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Baktygul received her share of her collective farm and began working primarily in raising livestock and farming.  She started this business with 30,000 Som.  Thanks to her hard work, Baktygul now has one dairy cow with a calf and one heifer on her farm.  The monthly income from her business is about 5,000 Som.  In order to develop her business further, Baktygul has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 Som (KGS) to purchase livestock she can raise and sell.  She plans to use the proceeds from her loan to increase her head of livestock so she can save for the education of her younger son, who is now 16 years old.  In the future, Baktygul plans to buy a house in the village for her son, so that in her old age she can easily take care her grandchildren."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1225313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Mamlekat is 55 years old, widowed and the mother of two children.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, she received her share of a collective farm.  As her main source of income, Mamlekat has begun to raise livestock and grow crops, a business she started with 30,000 Som.  She is a very interesting, good-natured and responsible person.  Thanks to her hard work, Mamlekat's farm is now in very good condition.  Her son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren help her with the farm, which generates a monthly income of 10,000-15,000 Som.  To develop her business further, Mamlekat has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 Som (KGS) to buy a cow and a bull to feed and resell.  She plans to use the proceeds from the loan to further increase her head of livestock so she can begin saving money to improve her living conditions by making repairs on her farm.  In the future, she dreams of buying an apartment in the city of Kara-Balta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1225444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
