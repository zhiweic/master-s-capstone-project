He hopes that once the loan is granted by CEPRODEL he'll be able to fulfill his dream for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":633.33,"image":{"id":1336535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy sand, cement, rebar, bricks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115711,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675375,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539652,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788884,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065197,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829074,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384853,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978586,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T04:45:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554146,"name":"Francis Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francis, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 2 hijos de 3 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, con quienes vive en una aldea de Santa Cruz de Yojoa.

In order to further develop her business, Aigul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing the quantities of domesticated livestock in order to pay for her children's

Umedjon's father is a doctor and works at a village hospital, and mother and wife have been involved in fattening up livestock at home for 4 years, specifically they buy, fatten up and sell livestock.  Umedjon plans to use this loan to repair his house because it is in a bad condition, and to expand the space for keeping livestock.

","en":"Safargul is a 48-year-old resident of Kulob and a married mother of six. She has three daughters and three sons. Her husband works abroad. Safargul's oldest daughter helps her mother with work and is learning to embroider. Two of Safargul's sons sell DVDs and SIM cards. Her other three children are in high school. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years Safargul has sewn and sold national dresses (chakan) and skullcaps. This craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Safargul learned to embroider from her mother. Now this craft is her profession and she is teaching her own daughter. \r\n\r\nSafargul is requesting a loan to purchase an electric sewing machine in order to make her sewing easier and to save time. This will give her more free time to embroider skullcaps, which are sewn by hand.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":213.9,"image":{"id":1342268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to

","en":"Norida is a kind, cheerful, and helpful 42-year-old woman. She is married and has three wonderful children. Financial difficulties in her family prevented Norida from attending university after finishing high school. However, she completed a trade school for sewing. Since then she has worked as a seamstress from her home. She also teaches her daughters. \r\n\r\nAlthough this job brings her a steady income, Norida also works on a dekhan farm. Her husband also used to work with her on a dekhan farm, but the income was not enough to provide for their family comfortably. Hence, he decided to go to work in Russia just as many men from their village do. In Russia, he receives a regular salary that he sends to his wife. Norida's oldest son also works for the family. He is a carpenter, but his work is seasonal and therefore he does not always have an income. \r\n\r\nNorida and her family live in an old house that was passed down to her by her parents. Every year the condition of the house worsens. The weather, especially frequent rain and snow, effects the condition of the house. The roof is in need of a major renovation. All of the members of Norida's family tried to save money for a home renovation, but they simply could not manage to gather the necessary funds.

The family's additional income is Irina\u2019s mother in-law's monthly pension.\r\n  \r\nIrina requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Irina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irina will purchase car-painting equipment. She already has built a small commercial space where she plans to open a new business and paint the cars. Irina and her husband will work on this business themselves. They will not have to pay a salary to somebody else. This will decrease the expenses and increase the family profit.

is 53 years old. He lives in the village of Gora, Vani District, with his retired brother and sister and nephew. Pridon has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for this family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, a vineyard and a plot of land where nut trees and vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to make dairy products. Harvested vegetables and grapes are sold with the dairy products locally at the markets and the family earns a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nPridon requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Pridon has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Pridon will purchase all the needed materials to build a greenhouse. With the greenhouse, he will be able to sell vegetables not only in summer but wintertime too. This will significantly increase the family income. With the increased income, Pridon will be able to expand his agricultural business and improve the family's living

is 42 years old. He lives in a small village of Gori District with his wife and three children. Ioseb requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell harvested produce locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIoseb requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ioseb has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

is 22 years old. He lives in Anaga village, Sighnagi district with his retired grandparents. Vano requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nVano is a professional car painter. He is working on private orders and earns a small salary. The family receives additional income from Vano\u2019s grandparent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\nVano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Vano has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vano will purchase four piglets.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuram\u2019s wife is working abroad and she sends transfers to the family. His daughter Ekaterine is an administrator in a food production company in the capital city. Guram\u2019s son Ivane is an invalid and he gets monthly pension from the government. As Ivane needs special care, family monthly income is rarely enough to cover their food expenses.\r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to re-start up the family business. Guram has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will purchase liquid gas.

is 28 years old. She lives in a small village of Mtskheta District with husband Kakhaber and two children who go to school. Ia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. They have a plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown for selling. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIa requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her loan Ia will pay for installation of electricity cables in their car workshop.

She learnt this trade from her mother and has been doing it for several years. \r\n \r\nThe loan that she is taking out is to increase her capital (buy wool) which she will purchase from the markets in the city of El Alto. After making them she will sell them in her community's market. This work allows her to generate resources to be able to maintain her home as she is married with seven children.  \r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes that payments take place within her town. \r\n\r\nThere is one woman missing in the photograph who had to go check her herd."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2317.73,"image":{"id":1343355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Secundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermina Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Porfirio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nelly\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":17725.48,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1795.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1770.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.11},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":260.8,"local_amount":1795.23,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1802,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021446,"comment":null},{"amount":257.11,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809254,"comment":null},{"amount":514.24,"local_amount":3539.82,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3553.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669324,"comment":null},{"amount":257.11,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915083,"comment":null},{"amount":257.12,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197714,"comment":null},{"amount":257.12,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153466,"comment":null},{"amount":257.11,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615062,"comment":null},{"amount":257.12,"local_amount":1769.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-07T01:22:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555208,"name":"Wilfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilfredo, de 53 a\u00f1os,esta casado con Gisela y tiene 2 hijos.

This way of working allows her to generate resources to maintain her household as much as possible as she lives in a partnership and she has a daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she says that she likes the training in health and credit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":1344264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy notebooks, geometry sets, pens, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nehidi\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhoselin Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27777.76,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3611.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4027.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4027.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":523.26,"local_amount":3611.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021449,"comment":null},{"amount":583.62,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809257,"comment":null},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669327,"comment":null},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915086,"comment":null},{"amount":583.63,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197717,"comment":null},{"amount":583.62,"local_amount":4027.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153468,"comment":null},{"amount":583.61,"local_amount":4027.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4032.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615064,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-09T14:24:08Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T21:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555430,"name":"Samith's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samith is 54 years old and married.

He is happily married and lives in a home of his own along with his wife and children.\r\n\r\nThis man has more than 20 years working in the farming trade and his main activity is raising basic grains such as corn and beans, which he sells to buyers who arrive in the city during the summer months.  This client works daily on his land and produces basic grains during the winter months, which is his main source of income.  He also raises cattle which also generates sustenance for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth time that this client has approached the Ceprodel offices to request a loan so he can buy the supplies he needs, such as compost and fertilizers, and also to prepare the land so he can plant the different crops that he harvests.  The winter is approaching and he needs to be prepared.\r\n\r\nHe has shown gratitude for the previous loans.  They have positively helped him because he has been able to tend to his crops, since his income is annual and the household needs money until he is able to sell his crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1338707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5296.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788894,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5296.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978596,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T23:21:53Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555445,"name":"Pov's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pov lives in a rural village of the Sangke district of Battambang province, Cambodia.

She hopes this loan will enable her to get a high yield from her rice paddy so as to better her family\u2019s living condition.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1343983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pesticides for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreyya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-05T18:27:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554758,"name":"Sara Yaneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara de cuarenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su madre y hermanos, ella posee una tienda desde hace 3 a\u00f1os donde vende productos de primera necesidad como frijol, ma\u00edz, embutidos, panes, bebidas , golosinas, entre otros, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia por los a\u00f1os que tiene de ternerla se ha hecho de mucha experiencia en las ventas que le permite alcanzar muy buenas ganancias, tiene mucha clientela pues la prefieren porque todo lo que vende es de primera calidad, a precios accesibles y sobre todo con un excelente servicio; Sara quiere realizar una nueva inversi\u00f3n pero no posee de suficiente capital por eso le solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar granos b\u00e1sicos, pan, embutidos, producto instant\u00e1neo, golosinas, bebidas, etc. es muy responsable, asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez tiene fe que le dar\u00e1 a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Sara is 43 years old and lives with her mother and siblings.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has a shoe business with a workshop in their house.

Additional family income is from his grandmother\u2019s monthly pension. \r\n\r\nNugzar requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Nugzar will install gas equipment in his car.

The cell phone companies sell their cards and credit to individuals who then sell them to the public. Olivia's business strategy is to sell individual items as well as to sell credit in bulk. Her stand is located on a busy avenue on which many people travel. \r\n\r\nThis is Olivia's first loan from HOPE Congo.

Her husband has been running a taxi service for local people for four consecutive years and accumulated a vast amount of experience in picking up customers and driving them quickly to their destinations. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years due to harsh winters, especially the bombardments of strong storms and freezing frosts. Therefore, Bolormaa is requesting a loan of 6950000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as planks, cement, fiberglass, and foam. Using these materials, they can repair and insulate their house, thus providing comfortable and warm accommodations for the family. More importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1074.29,"image":{"id":1344065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

has four children. As a source of income for her family, Bais works with livestock breeding. She started this business in 1990 with an amount of 1,000 som (KGS), which she used to purchase a calf. Thanks to Bais' persistent work, her farm currently has two cows and 30 sheep, and her monthly income is around 20,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Bais turned to the micro finance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cattle for fattening and reselling. Bais plans to invest the income from the loan in further expanding her business.

She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it for a day. She mixes the dough with water to get a porridge-like consistency and cooks it by stirring continuously to prevent it from forming lumps. The porridge only has to cook for a couple of minutes and then it is ready to be served. Corn porridge goes with bread of any kind and fried doughnuts.

","en":"Egam is an elderly but active man of the age of 50 years. He is married and has six children. In his youth he received education in carpentry and for a long time he worked as a carpenter. But when he got a family and children, this type of work became very difficult for him, as the work was a physical exertion for him. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, Egam and his wife started their own business, which does not require hard physical work and brings a good and stable income. To this day Egam works with fattening cattle. He has a small plot of land next to his home. Currently Egam has four sheep and goats. He not only raises and sells livestock, but also sells milk from it. Every morning his wife and children sell 10 liters of milk to the neighbors and other customers. \r\n\r\nEgam's eldest son is in Russia as a migrant worker and every month, when possible, he sends financial support to his parents. Egam wants his children to have a good income and not be in need of anything. He would like to expand his business, in order to receive a larger income. Therefore he would like to get a loan from Arvand, to increase the number of livestock and the size of his income. After that he would like to expand his business and increase the quality of life for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":478.44,"image":{"id":1339415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal
