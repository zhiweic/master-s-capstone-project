is 24 years old. He lives in Khoni District with his mother and brother. The family runs a small dairy business of a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. They sell their dairy products locally. Mamuka has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan programs extend business start-up and re-start up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor. These families do not have access to credit products, because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

Also, part of the loan will be used to invest in all the spices that will be used in cooking the food. She believes that her restaurant business will succeed, because she has being cooking and selling food for a long time. Her existing, regular customers provide an available market for her food. Also, the increasing number of schools in the town of Bamenda greatly act as a market for prepared food, which is another reason to expect the business to succeed. From this restaurant business, the community will be able to consume good-quality, always-ready cooked food. They also will not need to go long distances to buy cooked food.\r\n \r\nWith the profit from the loan, she will educate her children, pay rent for their home, and provide all the basic needs for her children, like medical care.

She\u2019s a very kind, hardworking woman who very much wants to get ahead.  Unfortunately, Angelina was unable to study nursing because she had to go to work very young but she would have loved to have done so.  In her free time she enjoys spending pleasant time with her family and sometimes cooks a delicious Chicken with Rice to pamper them with.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Angelina works in her small business selling beverages.  She starts work every day very early in the morning and can work up to 12 hours daily.  She thinks she does well because of the good prices she offers her customers.\r\n\r\nAngelina is grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided she will be able to buy merchandise like soft-drinks, mineral water and beer, among others for her business.  In this way, Angelina will have the business well-stocked and will be able to increase sales and income this way that will help her to gradually expand the business and become a distributorship.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1230956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMary Jane oversees the operation of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one jeepney with a capacity of 14 - 16 persons, which generates a boundary payment (a daily rental fee paid by the driver) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in her local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and to maintain the jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams of giving her family a good life and hopes to give her child a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is married and her husband is a driver. They have three children between the ages of 14 and 26, who live at home and are currently in school.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years she has been selling fashion clothes in the local market. She started this business by selling on a table in front of her house with 1,000 LRD that she received from her fiancee. Her profits are used on food and school fees.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\nJacklen is a 54-year-old woman. She is a housewife and a mother to one son. Her husband earns a pension which is low and not enough to cover the family's need.\r\nJacklen wants to offer better house living conditions to her family, so she is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a refrigerator which the family will use for preserving food at their house. Taking this loan will create healthy and suitable living conditions for Jacklen and her family. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

She has been managing a bar in one of the capital's districts for the past ten years and she sells healthy drinks and food there. Over time she has acquired experience in this field and this has enabled her to build up a significant customer base. Unfortunately her limited stock does not allow her sufficiently to meet customer demand; this has led to a significant decrease in customer demand and in turn to a decrease in her sales and profits. She is thus requesting this loan so that she can buy more crates of drinks.

She is a housewife and her husband is employed. However, he gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the costs.\r\n\r\nMaysa needs to change her old bedroom furniture, so she is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture. This will enable Maysa and her husband to enjoy healthy and comfortable sleep and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It is located in the historical city of Cartagena de Indias. The customers are from her own neighborhood and from the nearby areas. She pays for her purchasing up front and in small volumes and that's why she has to go to the market several times a week. Maria's customers are mainly her own neighbors, housewives who acquire the basic family basket items in small quantities to consume daily. This business was her late husband's idea. With it, she has been able to continue generating income for her household's wellbeing. At first she only sold small quantities of fried food, but when she saw what people needed she expanded adding groceries little by little and later snacks, beverages and now she also sells varied merchandise, mainly cosmetics and cosmetics. Right now, she needs to take advantage of the end of year holidays when her sales increase and her working capital is insufficient for responding to the customers.

The group is made up of six members, all of whom have a business:  Artemio and Martha invest in sheep, Teresa in pigs, Jacinto in blender goblets and Abel in chickens.  It was these same members who chose the name of the group, because the representative in whose house they meet grew cempazuchitl flowers, which are used to decorate offerings on the Day of the Dead or are placed on tombs.  One of the group's members, Alfredo, is a 39-year-old man who is obviously very responsible and always cheerful, whatever the circumstances.  He is married to Mar\u00eda del Carmen, with whom he has had 7 children, only 3 of whom are currently still dependent on him.  Alfredo is applying for this loan as he is in the plastics trade; in fact, he has six years' experience of selling blender goblets.  Every 8 or 15 days, when he needs stock, he goes to a nearby village called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec when he stocks up with what he needs.  He goes from door to door trying to sell his goods and, occasionally, sells them at the street market.  He decided to set up his business as a means of supporting his family after his job in Mexico City finished and he was left unemployed.  \"The only problem is almost always lack of money\" says Alfredo, who says that he also grows vegetables, mainly coriander, radishes, cauliflowers and broccoli.  Alfredo is a very hardworking and responsible person who needs a financial boost.  A loan from Kiva would undoubtedly help him tremendously as his previous loan enabled him to set up a small shop where he sells essentials.  He is very happy with his achievement since it is a way of improving the quality of life of his children and wife who still depend on him.

This photo was taken inside his barber shop.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years Mohammad has had a barber shop, which is the only shop of this kind in the place where he is. He has a good reputation among customers, which has been profitable for his business. He has a lot of loyal customers, but the shop needs some support to cover the costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new barber kit, which has tools such as different types of hair scissors, a collection of hair brushes, and hair and face creams. This will improve his work and satisfy the desires of his customers, which will lead to increased demand from his customers and an increase in income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

","en":"Anvar is 50 years old, married, and has one son. Unfortunately, he was unable to afford to pay for an education for his son, so his son currently works in the Russian Federation and tries to send money to his parents whenever possible. Anvar's wife works from home sewing traditional national pillows and mattresses. Anvar is a stomatologist and treats his clients at home where he has all the necessary equipment. However, all his earnings go towards supporting his family. Now that the rainy weather of autumn has arrived, Anvar wants to repair the roof of his house because it has been leaking for the past 2 years. He will use the loan money to buy construction materials to fix his roof before winter. Anvar thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

She began with 5 head of livestock. Her husband works in construction as an assistant foreman, and in his free time, he helps his wife. Madina is now trying to develop her business, as this is the main source of income for the family. She will use the loan money to buy more livestock to increase her herd.

She is married and has 3 children. For over 12 years, Mahbuba and her husband have been keeping livestock, and presently have around 7 sheep and goats. Mahbuba keeps the animals at her home. She is an expert in the intricacies of her business and knows well when to purchase and when to sell livestock. In addition, the family has a garden where they grow fruit and vegetables. In spring and summer, Mahbuba's husband sells their harvest at the market. Their eldest son is presently working in Russia and, if possible, sends money to his parents every month.

I hope you can continue helping all the microentrepreneurs with their projects.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1229824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fish and two new washing machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-09T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-09T15:30:04Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernanado Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77412},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84492},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86463},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88481},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90545},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92658},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94820},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97032},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99296},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101613},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103984},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113204}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.82,"local_amount":77412,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":78201.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130838,"comment":null},{"amount":46.73,"local_amount":84492,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":85353.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497751,"comment":null},{"amount":46.68,"local_amount":84399,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":85259.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967769,"comment":null},{"amount":214.18,"local_amount":387238,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":391186.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816972,"comment":null},{"amount":274.59,"local_amount":496459,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":501521.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323257,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T05:02:40Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:52:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493076,"name":"Abigail","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abigail is 31 years old, married, and has two children who attend school.

is 37 years old and lives with her husband and three children, who range in age from 11 to 16, in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Her family lives in a small house in the outer districts of the city, and her children attend public school while her husband works as a sergeant at a local group of soldiers. Mendsuren supports her family by selling clothing at two retail stalls in the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She began her business in 2002, and it has grown so that today she has 2,100,000 Mongollian Tugriks (MNT) in working capital.

En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el cual comprar\u00e1 ropa, y jugueter\u00eda, que son los art\u00edculos que mas vende  en el mes de Diciembre, experiencia que ha consolidado en sus 4 a\u00f1os de tener el negocio, apoyado por su suegra, quien como habita en Los Estados Unidos, le env\u00eda todo lo que necesita y  que los almacenes ofrecen con  descuentos,  porque han pasado las temporadas en las cuales son compradas por los norteamericanos y estos dejan de adquirirlas. Sus ventas las realiza a cr\u00e9dito y tambi\u00e9n de contado a sus principales clientes, que son los vecinos de su sector,  quienes  diariamente pasan por su miscel\u00e1nea de Vanessa para conocer que tiene de nuevo y comprarle.  ","en":"Vanessa, 25, lives in Cartagena de Indias, a beautiful, historic, coastal city on the shores of the Colombian Caribbean.  She has a variety store there where she sells a little bit of everything, especially clothes from the United States of America her mother-in-law sends her from there.  Vanessa lives with her spouse and little six-year-old son who she dreams with seeing become a very successful person.  This is why she works persistently to reach her goal.  Vanessa takes advantage of all seasons of the year to invest in her business and this final one of the year that\u2019s filled with family gatherings is no exception because there is cash circulating in the streets and everyone is ready to spend.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy clothes and toys which is what she sells most in December, something she\u2019s learned from her four years\u2019 experience in business.   She gets support from her mother-in-law who lives in the United States; she sends her everything she needs that's on sale in stores because it's off-season and North Americans aren\u2019t buying any longer.  She sells on credit and also for cash to her main customers who are her local neighbors who come by Vanessa\u2019s variety store daily to see what new things she has available for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1231463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothes

and has three children. Her husband works as a construction worker. Looking for an additional source of income for her family, she began an animal raising business in 1991 from a starting capital of 5,000 soms (KGS). She successfully ran her business and was able to start growing various grain crops that she sells for profit and uses as fodder for her cattle. She also grows potatoes. Ainur also earns money by working as a cook in a local school.

is a 44-year-old married woman, the mother of four children. Her family is her only concern in life, and she always aims to provide them with a better living, especially since they are Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and don't have the same minimum decent living standard as others do. For this reason, Zeinat helps her husband by operating her small clothing shop, which she opened in 2009, after seven years of prior experience in this field. To increase her family's income, and to make sure she can work at a good level, she applied for  a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua, in order to increase her collection of new clothes for the winter season to satisfy her clients' needs, and to renew her shop's decoration. Zeinat has a  good reputation and is well known for her excellent customer service. She is always looking for ways to expand her shop and introduce her customers to new clothing-related items, such as accessories, shoes, perfumes etc. Zeinat is very proud of herself and the level her business has reached."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1231721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to increase her collection of new clothes for the winter season and satisfy her customers' needs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Ain Al Helwi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2012-11-09T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-09T21:50:06Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zeinat ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918523,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339440517,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346993210,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735817,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441204,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846439,"comment":null},{"amount":419,"local_amount":419,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":419,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614667,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T17:01:11Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T08:58:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493285,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda is 42 years old, married, and has seven children.\r\n\r\nImelda works hard to provide for her family.

","en":"Numa is 40 years old and lives in the south of the city.  He has been manufacturing ladies' handbags for 20 years.  He learned his trade while working in a handbag factory and gradually began adapting his technical equipment; first of all, he bought a table top sewing machine and then a trimmer, and gradually started to build up his clientele.  This led him to go it alone in his own business venture.  He currently forms part of an outsourcing chain which supplies different stores, who, in turn, supply basic materials, such as leather and handicrafts purchased from the Wayuu tribe, in Guajira department, in the North of Colombia.  At the same time, he also works freelance, designing, cutting, sewing and finishing items.  He sells his goods on credit, while he pays in cash in the specialized stores where he goes to buy leather and other supplies necessary for the production of his goods.\n\nHis aim is to expand his business and add to it by employing more technology in his processes.  But his greatest challenge is to build up sufficient working capital to carry out his expansion plans.  He is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first funding, from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to enable him to buy a butt-seaming machine and materials such as thread and buckles.  This, he hopes, will allow him to improve the quality of his products and increase their sales potential in other local markets.

This group consists of eight members and is led by a Board of Directors headed by Sra. Rosmery as its president.  The members of this Communal Bank engage in different businesses such as selling juices, selling vegetables, selling blankets, managing a neighborhood store, selling clothes, selling dried foods, selling potatoes, and operating an upholstery shop.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will benefit small micro-entrpreneurs, such as Sra. Rosmery who is a member.  She says that she joined Pro Mujer six months ago after receiving an invitation from some friends who are also members of the organization.  At the moment, Rosmery has a business selling woven petticoats that are worn by indigenous women.  She learned how to make these items years ago after she started her own workshop.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital to buy wool.  She acquires her supplies at wholesale shops and then proceeds with making her products at her retail space.  Working in this manner enables her to generate income to financially support her family.

For the past 3 years, Felista has been working hard to manage her retail shop, in which sells sugar,rice, and salt. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Felista has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Fanik is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nFanik has two years of experience with her small home-based sewing and tailoring activity, making custom order dresses and household items made of fabric, such as curtains and drapes, sheets and towels. She would like to improve her work and take more orders. As the city has frequent and random power outages, Fanik finds it difficult to plan her work time. To be able to plan better and work more hours on the sewing machine, she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine to work with, as well as a table and a chair to make her work area a little more comfortable. To be able to pay for these purchases, Fanik took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.  \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients who are unable to provide a guarantor and who are therefore unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

His wife has started to work as an assistant doctor at a local company. His son attends a secondary school. Bayarsaikhan has been working as a freestyle wrestling coach since he graduated from the professional university in 1992. From 2006-2012 he worked as the state coach for the Olympic participants of Mongolia. Once his mission was completed, he returned to his hometown. He rented out his apartment while he was working in Ulaanbaatar. Now his apartment is in disrepair due to several other people who had rented his apartment. Therefore, Bayarsaikhan is planning to make some improvements to his apartment, such as changing all electricity cables to prevent fires, installing double-glazed windows and an electric radiant floor heating system, and thickening the house walls to stop heat loss. Bayarsaikhan said that the government gave him this apartment in 2002 in gratitude for his contribution to the development of freestyle wrestling in Mongolia.

Salam is a 24-year-old young woman, who is married and a mother to one son and one daughter, who are below 4 years of age. Salam and her family live in a small village. Her husband has owned the barber shop for eight years, and it has been the only one of its type in the village.  Salam and her husband consider the shop a profitable project. It has many loyal customers, but also it needs more support from time to time, to cover the costs. \r\n\r\nSalam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the cost of purchasing a new barber kit, installing mirrors, and obtaining some necessary cosmetics, such as hair and face creams. These purchases will improve the shop's work and satisfy customers, which in turn will increase the family's income. They will then have better living conditions.

Now it needs more support to cover the costs. Suliman wants to meet the increasing demand from customers in less time, so he is requesting a 1,500 USD loan from FATEN. He will use the loan to cover the cost of purchasing another sewing machine. This will improve his work and satisfy his customers. It will also increase the amount of work he can do each day, which will improve his income. As a result, he will be able to create better living conditions for the family.

In this business, she sells greens, fruits, vegetables, cereals, etc. The family also earns some rent income from their rental houses.\r\n\r\nMariamu learned about Milango through a friend and joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. The challenges she faces include the seasonal business climate and lack of enough capital to expand the business. The latter issue she feels will be partly sorted by this new loan.  \r\n\r\nMariamu is applying for a loan of 21,050 Kenyan shillings (KES) to buy vegetables in wholesale as well as retail stock such as soap and sugar, for example.

is a resident of Kongowea of Coast province, Kenya. She is a married mother of one child who has not begun schooling. She runs a clothes shop, a business that she has been operating for two years.\r\n \r\nShe learnt about Milango through an employee and joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve the operations of her business. Her main challenges are competition and bad debts.

from Sierra Leone!

Three of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nIsata runs a palm oil business; she sells palm oil at her house. She has been running this business for 10 years. She works at the business every day, 11 hours per day. Her husband is a businessman,  and she also receives income from him.  Isata says that the main challenge to her business is that the road network to the place she usually purchases her goods is very poor \r\n\r\nIsata has requested a loan in order to  buy more local foodstuff such as gari (cassava flakes), pepper and palm oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her installment quickly and to increase her business. In the future, she plans to build a nice house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1231982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

from Sierra Leone! This is 40-year-old Sallu from Kulanda town, in  Bo, a southern area of Sierra Leone. He is married with 4 children between the ages of 2 years and 18 years. His children attend school. He is seeking this loan because he wants to develop himself and his family. \r\n\r\nSallu runs a clothing business.  He sells shirts, jeans, blouses, bags, and shoes.  He has been running this business for 10 years. He works at the business 8 hours a day and 6 days per week, and has two relatives that working for him. He also has a bike that he uses for transportation and to bring another income into the home. Sallu says that the major problems for his business are the high cost of transportation and, sometimes, low purchasing power of customers.  \r\n\r\nSallu has requested a loan to purchase more clothing such as shirts, jeans, blouses, bags and shoes. The extra income from this loan will allow him to educate his children and increase his business. In the future, he hopes to open a clothing factory.

Agriculture is still the main occupation in this part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe woman with raised hand is called Mathiuboniu. She is 25 years old and is a mother to a son, 6, and a daughter, 4. Both her children go to a private school which is 3 km from her village. In her new home she lives with her husband and one brother-in-law (21 years old). Her husband is a lorry truck driver by profession and the brother in-law is a trained carpenter.\r\n \r\nIn 2009, with her first loan of INR 5,000, she invested in ginger farming, employing her brother-in-law. With the good harvest she profited INR 15,000. Without spending a penny and with her husband's help, she invested in buying equipment and tools to open a carpentry workshop for her brother-in-law. Eventually, the carpentry workshop became a good investment for her. Today she can employ two more carpenters to assist her brother in-law. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan of INR 10,000, she continued her ginger farming on a bigger scale. Unfortunately she was unable to reap a good harvest due to rodents and she suffered a great loss. However she was able to repay her loan from the carpentry investment.\r\n \r\nShe needs another loan and this time she wishes to venture into selling of ready-made garments. She plans to go to a border town of Myanmar and Manipur, a trading centre with all kinds of foreign goods. With the winter season approaching, she plans to invest and use her loan for warm clothes and blankets to sell in her shop.\r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the rest of the group members have made steady improvement with their respective businesses and will use their loans to expand. The business of the members, apart from the agricultural sector, includes weaving, paan shop, laundry service, clothes, merchandise and selling of consumption commodities door to door.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1231677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy garments, especially warm clothes and blankets to sell in her village.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-10T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-10T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wisemliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathiuboniu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aningtu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Athon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilamsiliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aliuhongliu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aliuboniu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pouchun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T18:33:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":493274,"name":"Kiuliang Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Initiated by Geeta, with raised hand, Kiuliang is a 12-member group.
