When Tahira suggested the idea of a self-owned business to her husband, he rejected it by saying that she lacks the knowledge and ability to do anything independently. Adamant on proving him wrong, Tahira borrowed money from her brother and injected it into a newly-formed grocery store. Today she is famous in her community for running a store that provides perishables to many households. She has five children, and three are currently attending school. Her current business cash flows do not allow her to enroll her remaining two children in school. Tahira now wishes to increase the amount of inventory in her store by purchasing more packs of beverages, oil, and milk. She has requested a loan worth PKR 30,000. This will enable her to cater to her customers efficiently without delay, which will ultimately help in generating more cash at home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1260602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to

After accomplishing her Bachelors Degree, she decided to engage in business to generate income. With a small amount of capital, she buys some dry goods and footwear that she sells in the local community. She has been in this business for almost three years and usually earns a profit of only PHP 6,000 a month, that she utilizes for their daily necessities. Due to the hardships of living, she aims to improve the business to supplement her husband's income and to save for the future of their children. To improve the business, she is asking for additional capital of PHP 35,000 to buy more dry goods like jackets, pants, T-shirts, shorts, underwear, shoes and slippers to sell. Through patience and hard work, she believes that she will improve the business and make it more viable and profitable in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1264463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more dry goods like jackets, pants, T-shirts, shorts, underwear, shoes and slippers to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

The donkeys help customers carry material from one place to another. He makes enough to meet the family's needs.\r\n \r\nIn order to purchase larger wooden cart for the donkey, Shehnaz contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of Rs. 20,000. This way her husband will be able to take more things on his cart at once, like fruits and vegetables. This ultimately saves his time and hopefully will increase his net income.

is a 42-year-old married woman who has been selling milk for many years. She has 3 cows and 1 buffalo to milk. When she first started working with livestock, she used to purchase goats and sheep and sell them at the festival of Eid-ul-Azha. Gradually Rasheedan purchased cows and buffaloes so she could move from livestock sales into milk production. She sells the milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter, cheese and ghee that she makes from the milk, and she is proud to maintain a good client list. Her business is good enough for her to lead a decent life.\r\n\r\nRasheedan is a mother of four: two daughter and two sons. Her husband also helps in her business. She has already been a borrower previously and has a strong relationship with Kashf foundation, Kiva's field partner. Now she is requesting a loan of 30,000 PKR so she can buy one more cow and increase her milk production capacity.
