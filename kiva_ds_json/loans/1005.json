Rafoat is an experienced seamstress who excels at sewing traditional Tajik dresses.\r\nShe is 28 years old. She is divorced and raising a child. In order to support her family, she launched her own business two years ago. Thanks to her good service, she has acquired a large customer base.

She has two children: a 3 year old, and a little one who is six months old. She lives in a rented house in a district in the central tropical forest.\r\n\r\nYulissa is an enterprising young woman. For 10 years she has bought and sold eggs, and distributed them to shops and grocery stores. For this, she has a motorcycle which she uses for these deliveries.\r\n\r\nA little while ago she had problems carrying out her work as she had given birth to her youngest child. For this reason, her sisters help her with her work. Now that she has more strength, she is continuing with her work.\r\n\r\n\"The work is profitable. I buy each tray of eggs for 12 soles, and sell it for 16; and if the quantities are greater, the profit increases,\" she says.\r\n\r\nShe wishes not only to sell eggs, but also other products. But she needs money to acquire her merchandise. This month is important for egg sales, so she needs support, so as not to let this opportunity pass by. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she feels happy for the support she has received all this time. In addition she says that her activities with the \"Luz y Verdad\" communal bank are rewarding because it is a responsible team.\r\n\r\nWith the money, she will be able to acquire more trays of eggs to deal with her orders, and supply more shops and grocery stores.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1247219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy trays of

Mavluda has a secondary education and appears to be a very honest and goal-oriented person.  Today, she has a working capital of 150,000 KGS and was able to repair her house and build a temporary place during this time.  She achieved everything thanks to her love of hard work.  In order to further expand her business, she requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover by purchasing a winter selection of warm clothing.  Mavluda plans to develop her business and increase her family's income in order to provide a normal future for her children.

She lives in her own home with her 15-year-old son, for whom she wants to provide a good education and a better quality of life.  Anith works as a designer and seamstress who sells clothing for women, men, and children.  She operates her business from a workshop in her home.  Anith has been managing her business for 12 years.  She says that she started in this line of work because she needed to generate income to pay for her son\u2019s educational expenses.  Anith now works with a few friends she hires whenever she receives several large orders.  She believes her business is profitable since companies request her sewing services whenever they need employee uniforms.  Anith also has contracts with various schools within the city.  She started her business by requesting a loan from a financial institution.  Anith used the money to buy her first sewing machine.  In the future, she hopes to open a shop that is dedicated to making wedding gowns.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her 15th loan with MFP.

Carlos is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because, with their help, he will be able to buy merchandise (men's, women's, and children's clothes) in order to start a small clothes-selling business with his partner. Carlos wants to continue working hard to be able to provide a good education and quality of life for his son."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1223837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy

Her biggest dream in life is improving her living conditions; having work stability in order to keep on making progress; being able to repay the loan; and seeing her family enjoy good health.

The current business earns her about 27,000 KHR per day and allows her to save about 7,000 KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses.\r\n\r\nChhen\u2019s group is composed of three members who are just with VisionFund this cycle. She is leading her group to apply for a loan of 1,000,000 KHR each. As the leader, Chhen is going to use her portion to buy fertilizers for her farmland and use a portion of it to buy a bike for her child to commute to school. She hopes to get a high yield from her paddy-field so as to sell it for a good price to improve her living condition and keep her child in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1230033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

Rim is leading her group to take out a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 KHR. Rim will use her portion, 1,000,000 KHR, to purchase fertilizer to support her family's rice-growing business. She hopes that this loan will help to provide good quality crop yields so that she can boost her income and use it to improve her family's lifestyle and, most importantly, to educate her children by sending them to a good school.

Unfortunately, a lack of financial resources and the need to work to cover the household expenses meant he could not study for an Education degree as he would have wished and would have liked to have done. \r\n\r\nThanks to his committment, effort and the money he saved while working at a bakery, Elvis was able to buy his own motor-rickshaw which he drives and uses to provide a transport service.

He believes he does well because he is responsible and because he treats his clients well. \r\n\r\nElvis is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their help he will be able to carry out much-needed repairs and general maintenance for his motor-rickshaw.

The main challenge for her family\u2019s business is the lack of working capital.\r\n\r\nThis is Savon's sixth loan with Kiva\u2019s partner VisionFund. She successfully repaid the past loans which have helped her to relieve her family\u2019s financial burden and support her children\u2019s education. Now she can earn about 25,000 KHR per day and can save about 10,000 KHR each day for the future. With the need to support her business, she is now leading her group of four to request another loan with VisionFund. As the group leader, she will use her portion to buy seeds and pesticides for her farmland, as well as use a portion of it for land plowing. With this loan, Savon hopes to increase her crop yields so as to earn more income to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1231109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds and pesticides for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ratanak Mondul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:12:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:12:41Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samnang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreymom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2520000},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1680000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3017394.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197666,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":402319.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696231,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":804638.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942407,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T00:27:55Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:56:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492809,"name":"Kha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kha is 41 years old and married with three children.

He works every day from the early hours of the morning when he begins his work.  He is able to work about eight hours a day, and believes that it is going well due to his determination and responsibility.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is very grateful for the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they have offered he will be able to improve his house.  He wants to be able to buy construction materials in order to reinforce the roof of his house, since it is close to the summer season and the rains are abundant.

Two of them live independently and one lives with her, sharing household expenses. They do not own their house, so they rent. \r\n\r\nClara sells clothes and other items which she buys in the neighboring country of Peru. But the last time, her business there did not go very well, as they took away her merchandise and did not return it. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for approximately 36 years, and it has allowed her to help her household be financially solvent. \r\n\r\nShe was delayed in paying back her loan because of the loss of her merchandise, but as she is a woman who works with determination, she has managed to pay off her loan completely.\r\n\r\nShe is going to use her new loan to buy clothing and housewares for the Christmas season.
