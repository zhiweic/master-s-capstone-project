Because he has his taxi, the transportation is no problem and he can provide a better service.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Carlos will buy plastic bottles and soy to prepare soy milk. His long-term goal is to buy his own vehicle, as his current one is leased. He also wants to be able to begin building his own house and continue with the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1136668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase soy and bottles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":633.52,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":58.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":63.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":65.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":68.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":69.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120.28,"local_amount":117.23,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":120.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301340417,"comment":null},{"amount":61,"local_amount":59.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308096788,"comment":null},{"amount":62.73,"local_amount":61.14,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315331144,"comment":null},{"amount":63.81,"local_amount":62.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322939787,"comment":null},{"amount":65.54,"local_amount":63.87,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":65.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331072207,"comment":null},{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":65.08,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":66.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340318565,"comment":null},{"amount":68.29,"local_amount":66.56,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347013310,"comment":null},{"amount":70.17,"local_amount":68.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":70.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356453672,"comment":null},{"amount":71.41,"local_amount":69.6,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":71.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364459520,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

It is the sixth time that this group has requested financial aid from Alid\u00e9, with a view to increasing their business volume. The representative of the group, whose name is Ahlonsou, is the one with her hand raised in the photo. She is 58 years old and married to a man called Ingrid. Ahlonsou attended school very little. The couple has six children, some of whom go to school; all the children are in their parents' care. Ahlonsou and her husband cover the various family expenses between them. The children live with their parents. Ahlonsou has been selling palm oil in a Benin market for almost 12 years. At the same time, she also goes fishing in a Benin lake. She gets her provisions in a region of Benin. With a view to satisfying customer demand and increasing her income, Ahlonsou is requesting, together with the other members of the Dagbemabou group, a sixth loan from Alid\u00e9.

This is where she has her business, which is selling cosmetics. She is separated and has 2 sons. She has been involved in commercial activities since she was very young. Marisol started this business 4 years ago: her way of working involves collecting orders and then fulfilling them. Quite recently, she started selling clothes, since her customers asked for them. Marisol sells her products every day by herself, going to various parts of her city. She offers her products by showing them in a catalogue or bringing samples; in general, she always uses the latter method for clothes, as that way the customers can try them on and buy them. Until now, Marisol has not encountered any particular difficulties in her business, and she hopes to continue in this manner. With the loan she asks for, she will buy perfumes, creams, make-up products, jeans, and shirts.

Its leader (the one raising her finger in the photo) is Marie  Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9. The group members know each other because they live in the same neighborhood of Benin. With the goal of expanding their working capital, the group members are seeking a loan from Alid\u00e9. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 is married. Her husband\u2019s name is Simon. They have four dependent children, all in school. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 lives together with her husband and children. The spouses jointly provide for family needs. Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 sells fabric out of her home and as  street vendor. She stocks up in a region of Benin. She  has 10 years of experience in this line of business already. This is the third time that Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 and her group are seeking financing from Alid\u00e9. This loan will allow Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9 and the other members of the Nonvilele group to expand their business by  enlarging their stock and increasing their customer base and their revenues. The two prior loans have been duly repaid."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1140849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-07-16T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-15T20:00:06Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Monhou\u00e9d\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"C\u00e9lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Se\u00efmi Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":580000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":116000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118285.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326580,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083627,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315318015,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926591,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059509,"comment":null},{"amount":111.71,"local_amount":58900,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":60060.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339449468,"comment":null},{"amount":110,"local_amount":58000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59142.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347002320,"comment":null},{"amount":111.88,"local_amount":58991,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T08:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":60153.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355744680,"comment":null},{"amount":106.41,"local_amount":56109,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":57214.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364449234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T19:08:54Z","paid_date":"2013-07-22T08:34:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":450243,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 44 years old and married with seven children.

Despite being very close to the snow-covered mountain, Latacunga\u2019s average temperature is 12\u00b0C and has a moderately cold climate.  It is one of the most important cities in the Ecuadorian mountains thanks to the sustained development it\u2019s had since the beginning of the 21st Century.

Limestone and cement extraction, the growth of heavy and light metallurgy industry, agribusiness and the very well-known dairy and cattle industries have made this city into one of the cities in Ecuador that promises extraordinary advances.

In spite of being very close to the snow, Latacunga has an average temperature of 12\u00b0C (54\u00b0F) and a mild-to-cool climate.  It is one of the most important cities of the equatorial sierra, thanks to the sustained development which started at the beginning of the 21st century.  Currently Latacunga has around 63,842 residents.  The climate, along with not only the geographic conditions, but also the atmospheric conditions, has permitted the flower-growing industry to grow and become the economic engine of the region and bring in substantial foreign currency to the Central Sierra of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nMining is the other activity that sustains Latacunga.  The extraction of limestone and concrete, heavy and light metallurgy, agro-industry, and the well-known dairy and livestock industry have all enabled this city to become one of the many Ecuadoran cities that hold the promise of extraordinary growth.  The city now has its own international airport and impressive urban growth, complete with large markets and commercial centers.\r\n\r\nIn the tranquil parish of Eloy Alfaro we find Cecilia, an enterprising mother who fights every day to give the best to her family.  For three years she has been providing beautician services.  She spends roughly four hours each day in her work, since afterward she has to take care of her family.  She travels from home to home to perform this week.  She lives with her two children and her husband Juan, who is 44 years old.  He helps with the household expenses and earns his living as a private guard.  \r\n\r\nAt her 38 years, one of the obstacles that Cecilia has had to overcome is to start her business and do all that is necessary to maintain it so that it will function and grow as she wants it to.  To position oneself in the market is difficult, but she hopes that with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, an institution that works with Kiva, she will be able to buy beauty products and supplies and thus be able to improve her service and have more clients.  In the future she hopes to be able to open her own beauty salon and thus improve her income.

The house where they live was inherited from her parents. \r\n\r\nHer work is growing fruits and vegetables of the region, such as pineapples, limes, oranges, tomatoes and others, as well as selling fresh fruits. For this, she has a stand in the market of her town. She has been working in this business for more than 12 years, with the support of her husband and two laborers to plant and harvest her crops. She likes her business, because she is accustomed to this work, since she learned it from her parents. She also likes the income, which allows her to cover the expenses of her household and her children's education. On the other hand, she doesn't like the physical tiredness that comes after a long day of work. For this reason she takes rest periods of up to two days and then returns to her business. Her desire is to have more income in order to diversify her crops. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the MFP institution, and she feels happy about the opportunity to have a line of credit to move forward with her business.

is Erminia. She previously received a loan of 8,000 PHP. She used the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. Her earnings helped pay for some of her personal, house hold and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another loan of 10,000 PHP so that she can buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed in the store, the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her children. \r\n\r\nErminia hopes to expand her business soon and aspires to own her own home. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. She looks forward to this financial increase with a heart of happiness and thankfulness. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work each week.

 de 62 a\u00f1os vive en Puerto Colombia, un municipio ubicado a orillas del Mar Caribe; en esta poblaci\u00f3n de importante potencial tur\u00edstico  y pueblo de mucha paz, \u00e9l tiene una f\u00e1brica de bollos, o amasijo de ma\u00edz, envuelto con capachos, u hojas que protegen el fruto y al que en ocasiones agregan queso o an\u00eds, miel etc. Su experiencia data de hace 20 a\u00f1os y siempre contando con el apoyo de su esposa, quien le ayuda a preparar diariamente, los llamados bollos limpios, al que solo le agrega masa de ma\u00edz natural, productos muy saludable ,porque no contiene conservantes, saborizantes artificiales. Los principales acompa\u00f1antes de este producto son las tortillas de huevos, chicharrones, pescado frito y justamente los principales clientes de  estos productos, son los negocios que se dedican a la venta de alimentos o restaurantes y amas de casa cuyas familias lo consumen a la hora del desayuno principalmente. La Jornada de trabajo de Jes\u00fas, comienza a las 3:00 a.m. con la molienda, armado, cocci\u00f3n y finaliza con la distribuci\u00f3n  de los bollos aun calientes, con los que transita por las polvorientas calles del municipio. Actualmente Jes\u00fas est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 ma\u00edz en un mayor volumen, pues desea extender su mercado y necesita aumentar su producci\u00f3n, mientras sus indicadores financieros indican un importante potencial de crecimiento, ampliando su mercado, pues maneja un margen de utilidad no menor del 40% y sus materias primas rotan cada 5 d\u00edas, indicadores desde los que auguramos su crecimiento empresarial. Jes\u00fas afirma orgullosamente que su vivienda y todo lo que posee se lo debe a sus bollos, por eso quiere que cuando muera,  lo recuerden como el fabricante de los m\u00e1s exquisitos bollos que se producen en Puerto Colombia, municipio de Playa, brisa y mar, que es lo m\u00e1s lindo de la tierra linda, como lo afirma un canci\u00f3n que inspir\u00f3 a su autor en el Caribe.  ","en":"Jesus is 62 years old and lives in Puerto Colombia, a town located on the coast of the Caribbean Sea.  In this town of important touristic potential and  peacefulness, he makes bollos (a spongy bread roll made of corn) wrapped in leaves for protection which are occasionally flavored with cheese, anise, honey, etc.\r\n\r\nHis experience dates back 20 years, and he has always had the support of his wife who helps the daily preparation of the plain bollos.  They are made with natural corn flour and healthy products that do not contain preservatives or artificial flavors.  The bollos are typically eaten with egg tortillas, pork rinds, or fried fish.  The main customers of Jesus's products are businesses that sell food or restaurants and housewives whose customers and family eat them for breakfast.  \r\n\r\nJesus's daily schedule begins at 3:00 am with the milling of the corn, followed by the preparation and baking of the dough, and finally the distribution of the warm bollos through the dusty streets of the town.  \r\n\r\nPresently, Jesus is applying for his first loan from the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Mario Santo Domingo Foundation) with which he will buy corn in a larger quantity.  He hopes to extend his market, and he needs to increase his production as his financial indicators show an important potential for growth.  He maintains a profit margin of no less than 40% and his raw materials cycle every five days- indicators which foretell business growth.  \r\n\r\nJesus proudly asserts that his home and everything that he owns is owed to the production of his bollos.

Patricia enjoys sewing since it is a trade and occupation that allows her to have some earnings that help her support her parents in paying the household expenses. She says that one of the downsides is the physical fatigue from being in one position too long, sitting down, which sometimes gives her a backache but she doesn\u2019t let that get her down so she keeps working hard.

Thus, she will be able to double the production and sales of cheese and the income of the family will significantly increase. Also, Marina will fertilize her agricultural land and will sow more maize. After fertilization and needed agricultural work she hopes to get a larger and better quality harvest.

","en":"Jaquelin, 45, lives in the southwestern part of the city where she runs a fried food stall, selling cheese snacks, meat-stuffed potatoes, vegetables, chicken, tortillas and fried \"patacones\".  She has been in business for ten years and started with $50,000 COP in order to cover family expenses and carry out the many dreams she had.  Taking advantage of the fact that she likes to cook, she decided to set up business at home and then moved to a nearby location which was more appropriate for food sales when the business grew.  Her goal is to provide her children, ages 8, 10, and 14,  with a good education and see them become successful people.  Her greatest desire is to improve her living conditions, knowing that step by step she will able to give her children a better lifestyle through her work.  Currently, she is requesting a CrediKiva loan, which is her first through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy a hot food display case and a larger deep-fryer which she will use to attract customers and increase sales by projecting the quality image her business deserves.
