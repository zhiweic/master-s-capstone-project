She is married to Ronald, who is employed and the father of their 3 children who are 18, 12, and 2 years old.  They live comfortably together in their own home.  Amparo works in the sales of fast foods like broasted chicken, fried wings, \"salchipapas\" [fried hot dogs and french fries], and other things.  She sets up her cart every night in front of her house along with two tables with their chairs, where she attends very nicely to her customers, making their orders.  She has more than 6 years of experience in this business, counting on her eldest daughter's support in serving the customers.  She likes her business because of the economic income.  Furthermore, she likes the kitchen, and having the ability to support her husband with the household costs.  She thinks that her business is fairly profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.  As such, she has plans to continue with her business and to begin selling grilled chicken, opening a rented location.  This will be her 11th loan with the MFP institution.  Therefore, she expects their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans.  Besides, she mentions feeling pleased with her communal bank because of the support that they receive to advance with their business.  With the amount requested of 1000 nuevos soles, she will invest in the purchase of ingredients to prepare the fast food such as oil, flour, chicken, and other items,  looking for the lowest prices for her cash purchases."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1008569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"buy oils, flour, and chicken meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amparo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.03,"local_amount":309.41,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":311.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099712,"comment":null},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":159.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713847,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":172.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202740,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":178.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098419,"comment":null},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":183.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401211,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T00:39:11Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396370,"name":"Ruqaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruqaya is a conservative person so she has asked her brother Mohammad to take her place in the photo.\r\n\r\nRuqaya is 30 years old and single.

She and her partner, Juan, have 4 children, 3 of whom still live at home: Katherine, 19, Junion, 16, and Firorella, 8.  They live in a house that they worked hard to build.  Lleny operates a business buying and selling all kinds of soft drinks.  She keeps the drinks in a refrigerator that she bought to keep them cold.  Her customers want cold drinks and she provides them.  She's friendly and cordial because her customers want that too.  \r\nLleny started the business with an MFP loan and it was successful from the start.  She then used her profits to buy larger quantities of soft drinks.  She runs the business alone and says that it's profitable.  There's a lot of demand for cold drinks here because of the hot climate.\r\nLleny says that she didn't have any particular reason for starting the business.  She wanted something to do and a way to help her partner with household expenses.  She likes having an income of her own, though, and she wants to grow the business now.  \r\nThis will be Lleny's 11th MFP loan and she is grateful to the bank for helping her grow her business.  She tells us that she likes her community bank because they help borrowers turn their plans into reality.  \r\nLleny will use this 2500 new soles loan to buy wholesale supplies of soft drinks for her drinks business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1013189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to stock her soft drinks business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":380.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":398.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":396.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":427.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":443.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":453.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":295.89,"local_amount":778.66,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":792.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099815,"comment":null},{"amount":150.71,"local_amount":396.61,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":403.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713946,"comment":null},{"amount":162.55,"local_amount":427.75,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":435.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202842,"comment":null},{"amount":168.61,"local_amount":443.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":451.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098511,"comment":null},{"amount":172.24,"local_amount":453.27,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":461.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401327,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T05:48:26Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":396371,"name":"Yaseen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaseen is 39 years old and married.

She lives with Guillermo, who is a teacher and the father of her three children. Her children are sixteen, fourteen, and twelve years old. They live together in their own home, which they purchased after lots of effort. Floripes sells women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s clothing which her cousin sends from Lima for the different festivals. She also has a beauty salon where she offers services such as hair-cutting and dyeing, among others. She learned these skills by studying at an occupational education center. She is attentive in both sales and customer service, which earns her repeat customers. She has spent more than two years working in these businesses, and up until now has been working by herself.\r\nShe likes her business because of the economic return it provides her, the benefit of having a trade, and the feeling it gives her of being a productive person. She hopes to be able to spend more time at home to take care of her children and also to be a prosperous businesswoman. She considers her business to be reasonably profitable due to the demand for it and the good profits it provides her. As a result, she has plans to expand her beauty salon and convert it into a health spa, offering other services. This will be her third loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma], and she is looking forward to working with MFP to be able to realize her plans. Additionally, she feels good about her communal bank due to the support which it continues to offer folks, providing them with an opportunity to benefit from a line of credit.

From this business, she is able to generate an average of 5.00 USD per day. \r\n\r\nRecently, there are some broken parts of her house that need to be repaired on time, so Chea requested a loan from HKL to buy some construction supplies and to pay for construction laborer costs.

He is also kind and friendly, and has a great desire to do well in life.  He lives together with Mika who is a housewife and supports him in his agricultural work.  The couple have three children who are 17, 16 and 15 years old.  They work hard to provide them with a better quality of life.  The family live comfortably together in their own home.\r\n\r\nJuan's business is farming.  He has 60 hectares of farmland but only has 10 hectares sown with corn.  The corn is ready to be harvested and he already has buyers for it.  Juan started his business ten years ago with his own capital and the help of his partner.  They started sowing small quantities of crops but then expanded and increased their capacity owing to the demand they had for their produce.  Juan considers his business to be fairly profitable because his produce is in demand and he makes good profits, especially during periods when there is a shortage of corn.\r\n\r\nJuan started out in this business because he needed a trade and an income with which to support his family and provide them with a better quality of life.  Given the good results that he has had, he plans to expand his sowing capacity to 20 hectares as he has quite a lot of demand that he can't meet with his current production.  This will make him more profits and he will grow his business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juan's third loan from MFP.  He feels happy that he will have financial support in making progress with his plans.  For this reason, he pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He says that he feels happy with his community bank as he considers the members to be good people.  Juan will invest the 2,000 soles he has requested in paying laborers to harvest his corn and get it ready to deliver to his buyer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1013224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2010,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401335,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T20:24:22Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397789,"name":"Teopista","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teopista lives in Kampala, Uganda.

For this reason he has approached MFP for a loan to help him achieve better production. This will be his ninth loan. He is very grateful for this financial assistance.

She lives with Miguel, who is independent and is the father of her five children: Wendy (18), Deybi (15), Jennifer (10), Silvia (6) and Maycol (3).  They live together comfortably in a house that they own.\r\n<p>\r\nPilar has a bike rental business, and rents out three bicycles she owns and which are in working condition.  She also has a mototaxi which she rents to her neighbor.  She has a space set aside in her home where she stores her bicycles and where Miguel provides maintenance to them.  She started her business over six years ago with one bicycle.  After noticing a demand for her services, she decided to invest in the purchase of additional bikes.  One bicycle was stolen along the way, but she was able to obtain nine bicycles.  Through wear-and-tear, only three bikes are currently in working condition and the remaining six are being repaired.  Pilar\u2019s partner and children help her to tend to the business.\r\n<p>\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable due to the earnings she receives, as there is a demand for her services.  Prior to starting her business, she had financial troubles because her partner\u2019s income was not sufficient to cover the household expenses.  However, she can now help him and she hopes to have a better quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her earnings, she hopes to save in order to buy another mototaxi and rent it out to increase her income.

She is married to Nando, who works for himself, and they are the parents of children who are now grown-up and financially independent.  They live in their own home together with one of their sons, Ricardo, who is 24 years old.\r\n\r\nThe work that Gloria does is selling ceviche, which is a traditional dish in Peruvian cuisine.  She sells from premises that are located in her home, which saves her paying rent.  She tells that she began this business when her daughter came into some capital over three years ago.  Her daughter had the idea to begin this business, so they partnered together and began selling only on the weekends.  They sold to neighbors and also went door-to-door looking to find customers.  Later on, they set up a space in their home with tables and chairs to serve their new customers comfortably.  They have now increased the days on which they sell, and have two people helping with serving whom they pay weekly.  Her daughter is in charge of preparing the ceviche.  Gloria considers her business to be quite profitable, as it provides good earnings and they have been able to gain a regular clientele.  She comments that she began this work due to the necessity of having additional income, and to support her daughter in making the business a reality.  She saw that is was a good idea for them to venture into this, earning good results thanks to their efforts.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to expand her business with more tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers.  This will be her third loan with the MFP lending institution.  She is grateful to know that she can count on a line of credit to make her plans reality.  On the other hand, she says that she enjoys being part of her communal bank, as she considers them to be a united and responsible group.\r\n\r\nWith the requested sum of 1,000 new soles, she will invest in the purchase of cooking utensils such as plates and glasses, and also in furniture such as tables and chairs.  The balance will go towards preparing ceviche."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients to prepare more food, and also buy cooking utensils, tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T02:40:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:59Z","rounded_local_amount":150.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099831,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":160.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713961,"comment":null},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":159.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202857,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":172.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098527,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401349,"comment":null},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":183.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455653,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T14:57:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397892,"name":"Heyam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heyam is a 37-year-old woman.

She is a single mother, and has four children aged 12, 5, 3, and two months old.  They live in her parents' home, together with her dad an mom, who help her look after her children.\r\n\r\nGiulliana's business is selling food such as juanes (a traditional dish from the Peruvian jungle similar to a tamale), grilled chicken, snacks and other things.  Every afternoon she sets up her table in front of her parents' houses and offers all her prepared dishes for sale.  She also sells refreshments.  She serves her customers, most of whom are her neighbors, in a very friendly manner, and they recommend her to other people who over time become regular customers themselves.\r\n\r\nShe started this business over five years ago with a specific loan, purchasing and selling in small quantities so that she could later grow in line with demand for her dishes. Up until now, she has been doing all this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be quite profitable because of the earnings that it provides, and and because she almost always sells everything that she prepares.  She also tells us that she enjoys her business, as she knows how to cook.  She decided to begin the business out of the need to have her own income and have a trade, as she wasn't able to cover expenses for her children and she was having financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nSeeing her good results, she now wants to expand and open a grocery store in her parents' home.  This will be her third loan with the MFP lending institution.  She is happy to know that she will be able to have access to a line of credit in order to continue with her plans.  She also comments that she enjoys being part of her communal bank, as she knows all the members, and considers them to be her friends and to be responsible people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 1,000 new soles, she will invest in purchasing general groceries.  She will be looking for low prices for her purchases, so that she can start up this new business and increase her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1013863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a variety of products to stock up her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liset ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":150.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099832,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":160.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713962,"comment":null},{"amount":59.59,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":159.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202858,"comment":null},{"amount":64.29,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":172.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098528,"comment":null},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":178.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401350,"comment":null},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":183.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455654,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Victor and Furora live together in their own house located in the native community of Inchatingari, in the Perene district, in the province of Chanchamayo.\r\nSince he was a child, Victor has carried out farm work with ease.  Now, at his advanced age, he owns 5 plots of land where he produces coffee, oranges, plantains, annatto seed and yucca.  However, he gives priority to coffee and annatto seed since he almost always uses the other crops as a food source.\r\n\"I have 4 coffee farms.  Last year I harvested 20 bags and this year it will be the same\", he says.  Victor sells each 70-kilo bag for 120 soles.  Because of this, each year he takes great pains to care for his plants, so that common plant diseases such as coffee-leaf rot and rooster's eye do not ruin the leaves and coffee beans.\r\nSowing annatto seed is also profitable, because the demand for this product exists year-round.  Buyers use this fruit for the production of condiments and natural dyes.\r\nVictor and Furora live in harmony working together in the fields.  They have few worries, but they want to continue working because they like to live surrounded by plants and fresh air.\r\nThis will be this 3rd loan at the MFP, thanks to their support.  For this, he gives his word that he will be punctual in making his monthly payments.  He feels satisfied working with the communal bank \"Los productores de Inchatingari\", because of the solidarity and the common interests of its members.\r\nWith this loan, he will be able to pay day workers that he will hire to to harvest the crops.

She lives with Luis, who is a merchant and is the father of their five children, Irina, who is 22, Jilda, 19, Lisenia, 17, Helen, 13, and Katerin, 10. They live together in their own house, which she managed to buy with the help of her partner. Magnolia's business is selling secondhand clothing, which she buys in the commercial centers of the city to then sell by traveling to the little villages located on the banks of the rivers. The residents there buy from those who serve them in a friendly and cordial manner, who thus succeed in winning their business. She began this business more than 7 years ago with some of her own capital, the fruit of her and her partner's savings, and so far she has been working alone. She considers her business fairly profitable, since in these areas she manages to sell at higher prices and has higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nBefore she began her business, she had financial problems, since her partner's income was not sufficient and her family was growing. Furthermore, the prices of food were also increasing. Then she decided to generate her own income to help with the household finances. Now she would like to invest her earnings in a grocery store in her house, so that she can spend more time near her children. This will be her fourth loan with MFP.  Thus she hopes for a little loan so that she can complete her goals. In addition, she is happy with the group in her communal bank because of the work that they are doing, providing help to people and their businesses. With the 1500 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of secondhand clothing, to thus increase her stock of merchandise, looking for affordable prices by making her purchases in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1013913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more secondhand clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magnolia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":232.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":227.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":247.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":256.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":261.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":274.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":89.11,"local_amount":232.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":238.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099835,"comment":null},{"amount":87.03,"local_amount":227.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":233.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713965,"comment":null},{"amount":94.9,"local_amount":247.56,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":254.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202861,"comment":null},{"amount":98.43,"local_amount":256.79,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":263.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098531,"comment":null},{"amount":180.54,"local_amount":470.98,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":483.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401353,"comment":null},{"amount":24.99,"local_amount":65.18,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":66.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455657,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She is separated from the father of her son Fabricio, who is 3 years old. She lives in her father's house with her son, her mother, and her father, who help her to raise her son. Ibethsi's business is selling food such as juanes (a stuffed dish similar to a tamal, containing rice, spices, and meat, fish or yucca), noodles, and other items in the mornings. To do this she has a stall in the market near her home where she serves her customers in a friendly and cordial manner, winning their business.\r\n\r\nShe began more than 10 years ago, using her own capital and preparing in small quantities. Seeing the reception that her business had, she decided to continue, and so far she has had help from her mother in preparing the food and serving customers, and she shares her earnings with her. She feels that her business is fairly profitable because she almost always sells everything she prepares, giving her good earnings.

She is married to Oscar, who is retired and the father of her children, most of whom are independent. They live comfortably together in their own home with two of their children - Cristian, 30, and Rosita, 16, as well as two of their grandchildren and their daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nSabina works selling a variety of fashionable clothes for men, women and children, as well as sheets and cushions. She acquires all these items on regular trips to the capital, then sells them among her friends and neighbours. She serves her customers with a very friendly and amenable manner, which means they are loyal to her and recommend her to others, increasing her customer base.\r\n\r\nSabina started more than eight years ago with a loan from MFP, when she joined a communal group, and until now she has been working alone. She describes her business as profitable, as it provides her with good earnings, and she is able to sell all her products. She decided to start her business due to a desire to have an occupation and to generate her own income, so she could feel like a productive person.

This will offer her family better and more suitable home furniture and will let them live in better conditions.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

is a 27-year-old single young man. His father and his mother are workers in a local chocolate factory, and their small salaries are not enough to cover the family's needs. For the past two years, Marwan has been raising and selling sheep and sheep products, which has been a profitable project. Marwan wants to expand his project by purchasing an additional number of sheep. He is requesting a youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs as he has gained a respected number of customers. This expansion will increase sales and improve the family's income.\n\nMarwan is photographed in his project.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She lives with her partner and the couple have a 1-year-old son.  Every day, Sandra works hard as she would like to provide her son with a better quality of life and improve her family's financial situation.  She lives in her own home together with her partner and son.\r\n\r\nSandra's business is selling clothing.  If anybody on her block needs to buy any clothing to attend a social or family event, they always seek her out because she has suitable garments for any occasion.  She has a small space in her house which she set up to serve her customers in.  Sandra has been in this business for two years now and works alone as she feels more comfortable that way.  She enjoys her business because it makes her income and also allows her to care for her son.  At the same time, it makes her feel very useful as she is contributing financially towards her household.  In common with all determined and entrepreneurial women, Sandra has many plans for the future.  She would like to have a store where she can offer the different clothing that she sells in more comfort and with better access to the public.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sandra's second loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges, once again, to make her repayments on time, as she did with her previous loans.  She enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.

He is the father of her two children: 9-year-old Leticia and 5-year-old Yadira.  The family live together in their own home in San Juan Centro Autiki, in Pichanaki district, in Chachamayo province.  Lucila is an organized woman.  Her house and her family reflect this outstanding virtue.  She has a business in her own home.  \"I have a grocery store where I sell a bit of everything.  I have had it for one year\", she comments, adding that it is doing very well.\r\n\r\nLucila is also a farmer.  She has three plots of land where she grows bananas and a little coffee.  She obtains 15 to 20 sacks of coffee beans.  She is aware that this work is tiring and time-consuming.  For this reason, Ronald works mainly in the fields and Rosa has to close her business to attend to her crops.  Lucila divides her time carefully between her children, her household, her business and her crops.  Thanks to her efforts, she is able to ensure that her income covers her basic needs.  She enjoys her work and, for that reason, she will continue carrying out her agricultural work.

is a 26-year-old married man who lives in Sana`a, Yemen.

He started his business because it has fast sales in the market and is attractive to business partners. He works at the business from 7:00 am until 7:30 pm, 7 days per week. He is an incredibly hard-working man and as a result has a lot of experience. In addition, it is the only main source of his income. On the other hand, through lots of effort, he has managed to grind his customer`s grain, i.e., he provides them a service to put food on the table. Recently, he says that the main challenge to his business is a seasonal problem: during the dry season this type of product is very expensive.\r\n\r\nSo, Mohammed took out a loan of 150,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase grain for his business. He hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow him to improve his standard of living. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to expand his business to have a extra mill store because his region is lacking some services which he could supply to solve people's needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1016428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase grain for his milling business so as to improve his standard of living.

Ten years ago she started to devote herself to agriculture.  In all of this time, and with help from her husband, she has managed to obtain 15 parcels of land, which are distributed in different parts of her area.  She produces coffee on ten parcels, and on the five remaining parcels she produces bananas and yucca.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor each parcel I harvest 30 sacks of coffee; my production is considerable,\u201d she says.  She takes all of her harvest on trucks that she hires for their transport.  Buyers from coffee cooperatives and from other cities come to the wholesale market.  They do not hesitate to pay a fair price for her entire production.  Sadith turns the money around and invests in more crops.  This is the way she acquired so many parcels.\r\n\r\nShe now wants to improve her production and devote herself to growing organic coffee, which is in more demand.

However his desire to work has enabled to him to move forward together with his family. Before Norberto worked as a carrier for a business which made for long journey to be undertaken. He didn't have much contact with his family and this discouraged him a lot. After this, the situation of public order was delicate for a time, which meant he had to abandon his job as a carrier and look for other alternatives to generate the necessary income to sustain the expenses of the household. Since then, Norberto set up a bar where he serves snacks, soda, and liquor to his customers. Additionally he has a pool table. Thanks to this work, Norberto can generate the necessary income for his wife and son and is able to spend much more time with them. Norberto, forced to set up his business with very little economic resources, he still had to purchase supplies that allowed him to offer a good service to his customers. It is for this that Norberto hopes that a loan provides him with the opportunity of accessing the purchase of a refrigerator where he can store the liquor and soda and offer them in a better state to his customers.\r\n\r\nNorberto hopes that he is able to access this refrigerator without seeing his monthly income affected and in this way he is able to continue offering a good quality of life to his family. Norberto dreams of consolidating his business and being known by many customers and in this way be able to have bigger sales that allow him to generate employment for those most vulnerable in the region. Additionally, Norberto dreams of his business providing him the opportunity of accessing the purchase of his own home."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1003602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a refridgerator where he can store the liquors and sodas and offer them in a better state to his clients.

She tells us that she recycles them and interweaves them with yarn or heavy thread, giving them the form of bags, purses, satchels, caps, etc.  Sometimes there are people who sell the rings by the kilo.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to continue buying materials such as yarn, fasteners in various sizes, heavy threads, pins and aluminum rings.  She states that she sells them in the country\u2019s capital, where they go for a good price.

The group consists of three women and three men, all hardworking. Every one of the group members is married and has a family, and every one of them works makes an effort day by day to get ahead. Some sell shoes by mail order, buy raw materials to make embroidery, buy plastic for greenhouses, buy carpentry materials. In summary all of them have activities geared around commerce, and they do them with the goal of making a profit. When they can they help with household expenses and contribute to school costs for the children or with the household pantry. Also, because they don't have fixed employment with salaries and want to invest some of their time in something productive and support their partners, so that they can continue on with all the necessities that they have now, it's worth mentioning that the people of this group are very responsible and hard working, very friendly and conscious of their responsibility in requesting a loan. This undertaking to improve their lives appeals to them. \n\nThe San Pablo community is an area with a lot of vegetation. Furthermore it has a very large reservoir which supplies the necessities of the community in large measure. In San Pablo they count on services like water, clinics, schools, and continuous transport to town. Beyond all that it is a well settled area, and to top it off a beautiful community. \n\nThe group decided to call itself \"Aurora\" because this is the name of one of the people who organized the group. It was the decision of all the group members that it would be a good name to remember that Se\u00f1ora Aurora took on new things that would benefit everyone. This is the second time the group has asked for a loan, however, Aurora decided this time not to ask for a loan, and that is why her name is not among the list of participants.\n\nThe names of the six members are: \n1. Ver\u00f3nica is 29 years old and is asking for this loan to buy men's and women's shoes to sell. \n2. Gilberta is 52 years old and is requesting the loan to buy fabric, thread, yarn and lace to make and sell embroidery. \n3. Librado is 47 years old and requests his loan to buy plastic for a greenhouse for cacti. \n4. J. Felix is 46 years old and is requesting a loan to make fried food. \n5. Tom\u00e1s is 42 years old and is asking for the loan to buy wood for use in his carpentry shop. \n6. Ma. del Carmen is 49 years old and she is asking for the loan to buy cloth, thread, lace and painted napkins to make embroidery for sale. \n\nLibrado is the representative of the group. He is 47 years old and finished elementary school. In his free time he does bricklaying, plumbing and electrical jobs. He has been married for 24 years to Mar\u00eda de Lourdes, who is a house wife. Together they have three children, the oldest of whom is 23 and married, and second oldest is 21, single and working, and the youngest of them is 20 years old and also works. Librado and his wife live in their own home - that is to say, they own it - and they do not pay rent. \n\nLibrado's motivation for joining this group is because he saw a motive to launch a business and so that the other group members, who also need money, can also participate in this undertaking. \"I am a very optimistic person. I like to help people and tell them that when they do their best, everything they want to do is always possible if they look for a way.\" Librado says, \"I do my work in the following way: when I receive money from my loan I am going to buy cactus stalks in town. The rest of the money I am going to invest in building a greenhouse which will be plastic and a supporting frame. Then when I've built my greenhouse I'm going to plant the cacti and fertilize them with cow and sheep dung, which works as a natural fertilizer. And once in a while I will have to water them because they need water, but very little. When they are grown I will cut them and I will take them to the market to distribute to businesses in town - to make back what I'm going to invest, I hope, and it will be well with me.\"\n\nLibrado says that until now he has not had any difficulty completing his jobs; he hasn't had any illnesses and in general things go well for him. \n\nLibrado has very concrete goals in mind. He would like to run his business on a large scale, build a big greenhouse and sell wholesale.

He is a productive man who provides construction supplies to towns, such as iron, cement and wheelbarrows among other items, a business he has had for four years.\r\n\r\nOrlando does his job to further the work efforts engaged in by the towns of Valle Rio Apurimac, since the engineers in each of the towns come to Orlando because he is a person who responds promptly to their requests. There are also difficulties in obtaining the work tools they request.

They live in their own home in San Juan Centro Autiki, in Pichanaki district, Chanchamayo.  \r\n\r\nTrinidad is a meticulous woman when it comes to carrying out her household chores.  She decided to start work preparing meals and selling them in a restaurant that she set up in her home.  She has been in this business for more than five years.  She started out selling sweet treats and soda but, thanks to the coordinated work of MFP and her own efforts, she now has tables and chairs which allow her to serve her customers comfortably.\r\n\r\n\"I sell breakfasts, lunches and dinners from Monday to Sunday\", she says.  Trinidad works all week long because she knows that this way she will be able to achieve her goals.  On weekends her work is more difficult as she prepares special dishes such as 'tacacho con cecina' (a traditional rainforest dish made from plantains and cured meat), chicken soups, freshwater fish prepared in different ways (fried, grilled, battered and fried, etc.)  Her customers already know her and are loyal to the flavor of her food.  What's more, they are the ones who decide what she should prepare each day.  She is happy with her business because her customers visit her, she is able to chat to them and they become friends.\r\n\r\nThis will be Trinidad's eighth loan from MFP.  She says that she will make her monthly repayments on time as she has in the past.  \"Flor de San Juan\" is the name of her community bank.  She is very committed to her group and trusts the other members.  Trinidad will invest her loan money in buying supplies and ingredients for preparing her food.  She will also be able to paint the walls of her premises to improve her business' image."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1015023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products she needs to prepare her food and to buy paint to improve her premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Trinidad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T11:23:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":397393,"name":"La Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Esperanza es el grupo formado por 14 mujeres de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed, ellas son vecinas y amigas de esa ciudad y tienen como objetivo principal ayudar a sus familias y por medio del trabajo en conjunto poder ayudarles a tener un mejor estilo de vida.\nUna de las miembros es la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda, quien es un persona muy amable y alegre, ella se dedica a la cr\u00eda y venta de animales, lo que hace desde hace mucho tiempo.

Now only three of their children live with them; they are 23, 18 and 10 years old.  They own their cozy home.  It is located in the village of San Juan Centro Autiki, Pichanaki District, Chanchamayo Province.  Martha has been making her living in agriculture for 30 years.  Together with Mois\u00e9s they worked to obtain the 4 plots of land they currently posses.  On those plots, they grow coffee, bananas and passion fruit.  They have been very satisfied with the coffee and the bananas at the time of sale. Now they have planted passion fruit.  The plants are flowering, indicating that the fruit will be ready to harvest in the months of May and June.\r\n\u201cThe passion fruits sell well, which is why I decided to plant them.  Hopefully they will sell quickly.  Each \"java\" (basket) costs 30 soles\u201d, Martha says.\r\nThe work in the fields is tiring and demanding.  And so Martha has learned to arrange her time to complete her housework without neglecting her crops.  \r\nMartha's older children help her with the plants and the harvest.  She feels happy about her family's support.\r\nAfter assuring good results from her passion fruit plants, Martha will expand another plot with new plants.  She feels certain that it will go well.  Martha will be receiving her 8th loan from MFP, and so she promises to follow her re-payment plan responsibly.

Now she has 8 children but only lives with 5, whose ages span 10 to 20 years old. This family lives in its own home in San Juan Autiki city center in Pichanaki District, Chanchamayo. \r\n\r\nDina is a farmer and plants her three parcels of land in coffee, plantains and bananas. Coffee production is economically profitable and she needs to cultivate her plantations all year.  Her crops are reflected in the money earned, which is enough to cover her daily expenses, reinvest in other plantings, and to set some aside in savings. The plantains are the key to her daily livelihood because she harvests them every week and the cassava are used primarily for her family\u2019s daily consumption. With the help of Eduardo and her grown sons she can optimize the work and make it more pleasant.\r\n\r\nDina and Eduardo also work as day laborers on the fields of others, thus earning a daily income. Also, when harvesting season comes she hires personnel to finish quickly. In this way the community engages in mutual support. She is happy to do this work, which enables her to maintain her household\u2019s stability.\r\n\r\nDina will receive her eighth loan from MFP, through your help.

She had four children but now only cares for two of them (Jeancarlos and Abel) in her own home, in the town of Cajas.  Ysabel brought up her children on her own as her partner was never around.  Her main business activity, which has helped her make a lot of income, is selling meals from her home.  In her restaurant she cooks homemade creole meals and she also serves traditional, regional meals in the afternoons. \"I always have to pep up my dishes because my customers become tired of them\" she comments happily.  Ysabel's business is doing very well but, as she is a woman with initiative, she also works raising pigs.  She fattens her pigs, then kills them and sells them as 'suckling pig' (a traditional dish in her country).  Many people know Ysabel and they are always placing orders with her.  Her secret is the feed she gives to her animals.  As she has a restaurant it pays to prepare her food every day.  Ysabel would now like to start a business buying and selling animals.  She has already bought a bull which she will fatten and sell for a good price.\r\n\r\nYsabel is a member of 'Mi Banco' community bank and this is her 15th loan from MFP.  She is grateful for everybody's help as she will obtain the loan she needs to achieve her goals.

With your support, Ysabel will invest the money she has requested in buying basic food products for preparing her delicious meals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1015049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products such as rice, noodles, milk, sugar and mixed veg for preparing her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-05T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-04T23:40:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455681,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-16T04:41:45Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400051,"name":"Elshad","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Elshad ochen drujelubniy i dobriy chelovek.

She lives with her parents and 7 siblings, whom she looks after, in her own home, located in the town of Cajas. She is single, but she does not feel bad about it since she helps her siblings and is getting ahead in life, and \"that's the most important thing,\" she states. She studied Education in a well-known university, where she obtained the experience necessary to develop in her career. She is now working on a government education project in which she is the area supervisor. She oversees a literacy program for both the elderly and for adults who were not able to finish their studies. She likes this noble mission very much and is happy to help people get ahead.  Nevertheless, just like the rest of the locals, she also makes bricks for a living alongside her brother. They both make an average of 29 thousand, but she cannot work on brick making full-time, which is why she produces so few. However, she is now thinking about hiring workers who can produce even more bricks. She is a member of the Mi Banco Communal Bank, and this is her 17th loan with MFP.

He sells milk and yoghurt to his neighbours. Milk and yoghurt, as well as meat, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and they always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered to be very healthy and are also common in everyday life.   \r\n\r\nSelling milk and meat brings in 300 AZN per month. This is Jahangir's only income in his family and is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. \r\n\r\nJahangir has applied for a 1200 AZN loan to purchase two baby cattle, one milk

She raised her son, Diofer, with whom she lives in her own home, located in the town of Cajas. She is very proud because her son is now a working professional. \"He helps me and is a very good person,\" she states. Thanks to her brick factory, she has been able to help her son get ahead since she has been doing this activity for 30 years. She states that with the help of laborers, whom she hires to help her out, she makes 25 thousand bricks a monthly, which she then transports to the local market by truck every week in the city's brick district. She earns good profits there, so much so that she now hopes to increase her monthly brick production. For this, she would like to hire more workers. What she likes most about her job is gathering firewood to burn the clay bricks that she makes. She states that it is fun because she walks in the countryside, her favorite place. She is a member of the Mi Banco Communal Bank, and this is her fourth loan with MFP. She is grateful for the support she gets from all of you since she will obtain the loan that she needs to achieve her goals. Furthermore, she promises to be punctual in making her repayments since the members of her association are responsible and united. Dionicia will invest the loan that she is requesting in purchasing clay, sand, and other supplies needed to make bricks."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1015057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase sand and clay to make more bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-06T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-05T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455682,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T01:58:26Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
