Her parents live in the country and they cannot currently support her financially as they have few resources.  She and her sister went to live and study in Santa Cruz in search of a better life and new opportunities and everything she earns goes toward her upkeep, which is why she needs the financial help the program offers to finish her studies and get her degree.

desde que la mama quedo sola cuando al papa lo mataron a la mama le toco una vida muy dif\u00edcil, pero esto no fue impedimento para que la mama le diera una buena educaci\u00f3n, que fue la primaria y bachillerato, que es lo m\u00e1s indispensable, pero el desde que empez\u00f3 a conocer lo relacionado con los computadores lo que m\u00e1s quer\u00eda era estudiar algo relacionado con los computadores, pero cuando sali\u00f3 del colegio lo que mas quer\u00eda le toco aplazar y le toco empezar a trabajar para de esta forma poder ayudarle a la mama con todo lo de la casa, pero la mejor forma era trabajar para ayudar con los gastos de la casa, esto por varios a\u00f1os, y a medida que pasaban los a\u00f1os la mama empezaba a requerir de  mas descanso por la edad, pero para el lo m\u00e1s importante era la mama por m\u00e1s que quisiera estudiar lo que m\u00e1s le gustaba ten\u00eda que seguir aplaz\u00e1ndolo por que si quer\u00eda estudiar de d\u00f3nde sacaba para los gastos de la casa, por tal motivo segu\u00eda trabajando en lo que saliera a si le gustara todo lo relacionado con los computadores, y muchas personas le daban animo pero con el animo es muy dif\u00edcil lograrlo hace falta plata que es lo que uno m\u00e1s quiere para lograrlo, desafortunada-mente ninguno de los dos tenia apoyo de nadie para lograrlo y lo que ellos ganaban no alcanzaba para todos las cosas que ten\u00edan que pagar, como son arriendo, comida y vestuario y mas que los dos eran solos era muy dif\u00edcil y para sacar un pr\u00e9stamo piden muchas cosas y de d\u00f3nde sacarlas para pagar el pr\u00e9stamo, ser\u00eda otro problema que no estaba dentro de los alcances que unas personas como ricardo y la mama podr\u00edan hacerlo, por eso lo \u00fanico que les quedaba a los dos era trabajar y esperar que mas delante de alguna forma se presentara la forma de que ricardo pudiera estudiar a si fuera en un largo tiempo, porque estudiando podr\u00eda ganar m\u00e1s plata y trabajar en lo que le gustaba, por que cuando una persona est\u00e1 mejor preparada puede aspirar a tener un mejor nivel de vida, porque es lo que el siempre quiere para tener un futuro mejor, ricardo trabajo en muchas cosas incluso en una ocasi\u00f3n le sali\u00f3 un buen trabajo relacionado con los computadores, no lo pudo realizar por no tener ning\u00fan certificado que lo relacionara con una universidad o con algo que lo pudiera ayudar, porque en una ocasi\u00f3n trabajo con una empresa realizando mantenimiento para computadores, pero esto no era suficiente para que le dieran dicho trabajo esto lo desanimo pero no era para mas si el quer\u00eda trabajar con los computadores y poder darle un mejor futuro a su mama y por falta de estudio no lo pod\u00eda, lograr de esta forma, lo \u00fanico que se pod\u00eda era seguir trabajando y esperar la oportunidad que se sab\u00eda que en alg\u00fan momento se presentar\u00eda, pero para esto paso un largo tiempo, pero ricardo manten\u00eda esta esperanza muy viva porque siempre lo hab\u00eda tenido muy presente en sus metas por lograr, aun que la mama de ricardo tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda que su hijo pudiera estudiar para tener un mejor nivel en su educaci\u00f3n era un poco dif\u00edcil con lo poco que ganaban por que si ricardo estudiaba de donde pagaban el arriendo y la comida y las dem\u00e1s cosas que uno tiene que pagar en la vida, pero ricardo no perd\u00eda nunca las esperanzas de lograrlo, por que cuando una persona se pone metas en la vida siempre las logra a si sea en un tiempo determinado, pero el segu\u00eda trabajando muy juicioso para darle  a su mama mas alegr\u00edas que era tener un sitio donde vivir y lo que se requer\u00eda para comer, hace una a\u00f1o ricardo empez\u00f3 a  mirar donde pod\u00eda estudiar pero los costos de todos eran  muy altos y el presupuesto era muy bajo pero el no se desanimo si no sigui\u00f3 buscando.\nBusco uno que fuera cerca de donde vive para no tener que pagar transporte, cuando ten\u00eda formas entraba a Internet o buscaba caminando cuando ten\u00eda tiempo,  a si fue cuando un d\u00eda llegando a la casa encontr\u00f3 un volante que ten\u00eda una informaci\u00f3n de una parte donde pod\u00eda estudiar y al d\u00eda siguiente se fue con su mama para averiguar los costos y los horarios para mirar si pod\u00eda estudiar, le dieron toda la informaci\u00f3n que requer\u00eda, lo que m\u00e1s le gusto fue que ten\u00edan un convenio donde las cuotas le pod\u00edan salir m\u00e1s baratas y esto era mucho mejor para el presupuesto que tenia ricardo.\nNecesito del convenio con kiva para que las cuotas le salgan m\u00e1s baratas y de esta forma poderse ahorrar m\u00e1s plata, porque a el le hace falta para otras cosas, por eso quiere tener la ayuda del convenio kiva. \n\nMuchas Gracias \n","en":"Ricardo had a very hard life after his mother was left alone when Ricardo's father was killed.  This didn't stop his mother from giving him a good education, however.  He finished elementary school and high school, which are the most indispensable.\r\n\r\nOnce Ricardo began learning about computers, what he most wanted was to study something in that field.  When he got out of high school, however, he had to put this aside and start working to be able to help his mother at home.  The best way to do this was to help with the household expenses for several years.  And as the years went by, his mother began to need more rest because of her age.  For Ricardo, his mother was always the most important thing.\r\n\r\nAs much as he wanted to study what he most enjoyed, he had to keep on postponing it because he didn't have money for the household expenses if he was studying.  This is why he kept on working at whatever he could get, although he liked everything having to do with computers.  A lot of people encouraged him but it's difficult with encouragement.  What's needed is money; money is what one needs most to achieve this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, neither of them had support from anyone to achieve this.  What they earned wasn't enough for everything they needed to pay for, such as rent, food, and clothing.  And more than this, the two of them were alone.  It was very difficult.  To get a loan, they ask for a lot of things and where they're going to get them to pay back the loan.  That was another problem--that it wasn't within the reach of people like Ricardo and his mother to do it.  The only thing they could do was work and hope that later something would come up so Ricardo could go to school.\r\n\r\nThat's the way it was for a long time, because by going to school he would be able to earn more money and work at what he enjoyed.  When someone is better educated he can aspire to have a better standard of living, because it's what he always wants so he can have a better future.\r\n\r\nRicardo worked a lot of jobs.  Once a good job working with computers came up, but he couldn't do it because he didn't have a certificate from a university or something that could help.\r\n\r\nOnce he worked with a business doing computer maintenance but it wasn't enough for them to give him a job, which was discouraging.  He wanted to work with computers and be able to give his mother a better future, and for lack of an education he couldn't do that.  The only thing he could do was keep on working and waiting for the opportunity he knew would arise.\r\n\r\nA lot of time went by but Ricardo kept hoping, because he had always kept in mind his goals.  His mother also wanted him to go to school to improve his educational level.  It was difficult with what little money he earned, because if he was in school, they didn't have money for the rent, food, and the other things one needs in life.\r\n\r\nRicardo never lost hope because when people have goals in life they always achieve them within a determined amount of time.  He kept on working judiciously to make his mother happy and give her food and a place to live.\r\n\r\nA year ago Ricardo began to look into where he could go to school, but the costs were very high everywhere and his budget was very low. But rather than losing hope, he kept on looking.  He looked for a school that was near where he lives so he wouldn't have to pay for transportation.  He looked on the Internet when he was able or, when he had time, he looked while he was walking.\r\n\r\nOne day one the way home Ricardo found a flyer with information about a place he could study, and the next day went with his mother to verify the costs and schedules to see if he would be able to study there.  They gave him all the information he needed.  What Ricardo liked most was that they had an agreement with lower payments, which was better for his budget.\r\n\r\nRicardo needs the agreement with Kiva so his payments will be lower and he'll be able to save more money.  He also needs money for other things, so he wants to have the help of  the Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay his tuition for a semester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-05T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-05T16:19:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642077,"name":"Penh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Penh is 43 years old.

He is pictured here in a group of four One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of twenty-nine individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Japheth has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJapheth is married and has nine children.  He is 66-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee.  Japheth has been a farmer for thirty-six years.  Japheth described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nJapheth first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season.  Japheth joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader. He is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Japheth plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Japheth\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and pass the cost savings onto the farmers.  Japheth and the Jitetee S.H.G Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":" to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T00:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T00:40:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Japheth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zablon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":219309,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T03:55:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642511,"name":"Rosilene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosilene is 33 and married, and has always lived in Sorocaba-SP.

\n","en":" Zulley Alejandra lives in Bogot\u00e1, where she is in her second semester at CampoAlto, studying to be a nursing assistant.  She very much likes everything related to health, and her dream is to be a psychiatrist.  But the process is long: first she has to study medicine, and then psychology, and she does not have the means to study medicine. So, like many people, she will have to start at the bottom and work her way up little by little, until she realizes her ultimate dream of becoming an excellent psychiatrist. \r\n\r\nAlthough fulfilling this dream may be difficult and take a long time, a person must have a dream in order to have hopes and goals, so she will be a nursing assistant for now, as she does not have the economic means to pay for this degree.  Her parents are separated, and she lives with her mother, who is a stylist.  Her stepfather helps them, because her father, although working, has a lot of expenses and cannot help them at the moment.  She works as a waitress in an asadero (a barbecue restaurant that serves a variety of grilled meats, poultry, and other regional dishes). This way, she plans on paying her tuition, but she is a realistic person, and she knows that this is not a long-term job. And, because she is not yet legally of age, she won't be able find work that is permanent and secure. \r\n\r\nWhat she wants most is to continue studying, as education is the way to overcome ignorance and poverty, and she knows that there is something important out there for her. This is why she wants to continue to study, and she needs the agreement with Kiva; a Kiva loan would help her very much.\r\n\r\nShe knows that by working, even as a dishwasher, she will manage to complete her studies, and she knows it won't be easy. But she is also aware that if she doesn't fight, she cannot turn her dreams into reality. She already has her high-school diploma and she already has one semester of nursing studies. She knows that she can continue to move forward, but not alone. People don't move forward alone; there is always support from someone, either moral or economic. She has moral support, and she is asking Kiva for economic support. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the opportunity that Kiva lenders are giving to her and to other young people. Not only are they investing in young people, but also in the future.  With better work in Colombia, there will be support for people who want to move forward, and for their endeavors, a dream that is impossible for many. \r\n\r\nShe promises that anything invested in her, be it time or money, will not be wasted. She is not perfect, but she is very persistent, and she does not give up easily.

Victor is certain that success is dependent on his hard work and this is why he invests all of his strengths and means into developing the business.  His family - wife and children - are good helpers.  Suddenly, Victor received an offer to purchase land near his house.  Victor requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 hryvnia.  This is a good opportunity to expand his business because this land already has two greenhouses, and Victor will be able to plant more tomatoes there in the spring."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a plot with two green houses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T04:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T04:40:01Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":151,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T00:09:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639572,"name":"Nurida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurida is a seller.

Like any man, he loves his family and always tries to provide his wife and children with decent living conditions, food, education and good health.  Nazirjon raises livestock; he has a cow which gives milk to his children.

He started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 15,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Munarbek's hard work, he currently has 1 mare, 4 sheep, and 5 goats on his farm, as well as a garden in which he grows apples and plums. After gathering his harvest, Munarbek sells these apples and plums on the market to wholesale buyers. His harvest brings in a small profit. In his spare time, Munarbek also works as a taxi driver, offering his taxi services to the local population. His monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing his business, Munarbek turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" He is requesting a loan to buy horses to increase the size of his herd.

He is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group-leader farmers. (The field officer is also in the photo, standing on the left). The group leaders represent 51 individual farmers, who are not pictured here. \r\n\r\nJoseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative. He is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving a quarter acre of maize and a quarter acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph is married and has eight children. He is 70 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Joseph has been a farmer for 34 years. He describes last year's harvest as excellent but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nJoseph first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 long rains season. He joined One Acre Fund for several reasons: to get the best seed prices as well as fertilizer and hybrid seeds; to learn new farming methods; and to earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nJoseph plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for the farmers. His own life was improved because he had more profits from his harvest, more farm training and more group support and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Joseph and the Ngachi Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. The organization continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds. \t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T13:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T13:00:15Z","loan_amount":3825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":331638,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642139,"name":"Ali Yusuf","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali Yusuf, 30 years old, is married and has three children.

Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs and their children's education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nRowena dreams to buy another jeepney and hire a driver. She hopes that her family will have a better future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members each week to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.33,"image":{"id":1485235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her Jeepney.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T13:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rowena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3648.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-06T16:07:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642154,"name":"Thim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thim is 31 years old, married and a loving father of two school-aged children.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 50 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Zakaria is pictured on the right of the Baraka Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nZakaria is married and has 5 children.  He is 35 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking and, trustworthy.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Zakaria has been a farmer for 20 years.  Zakaria described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nZakaria first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Zakaria joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  He is an active community member.  Zakaria plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Zakaria\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Zakaria and the Baraka Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1484535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zakaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sifrose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":315591,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315591}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T02:37:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642162,"name":"Fikrije","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fikrije is a 56-year-old widow who has two children, ages 1 and 7.

It's an activity that gives her pleasure, as she receives income purely from her own labour, which she likes. Safargul doesn't work the land alone - her son and daughter, who are 25 and 17, help her. Safargul is the mother of five children - two daughters and three sons. The other children are in school. Her oldest son is married. His son and his wife live in his parents' house and help his mother. Safargul is 42. She is glad to have a big and happy family.\r\n\r\nSafargul grows agricultural crops.

Sharifa serves each customer quickly and well. Everyone is satisfied with her service. Currently the store is running out of stock and they need to bring in new goods so that they don't loose customers in a competitive environment.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 48 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Philip has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPhilip is a reliable member of the community.  He is married and has seven children.  Philip is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 25 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Philip is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue with the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nPhilip first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Philip joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, and earn enough to feed his family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader.  As an active community member, he wants to help more farmers.  Philip plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Philip\u2019s own life has improved because he has more profits from his harvest and has been able to save money and feed his family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers.  Philip and the Amani Group will use the Kiva loan to cover the initial cost of purchasing the seed and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting seasons to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":342336,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T21:14:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642783,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie est une dame \u00e2g\u00e9 de 37 ans mari\u00e9, m\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont l'\u00e2ge varie de 15 \u00e0 6 ans.

She lives in a small village of Sachkhere district with her husband Goderdzi and two children. Nona is unemployed at the moment, in spite of being highly educated. There is a high unemployment rate in the region especially among people up to 40. Her family is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have cows whose milk is used in cheese products, and they also have a bit of agricultural land where they grow different kinds of vegetables.\r\n\r\nAs their current income is not enough for a four-member family and Nona can\u2019t find a job, she requested a loan for a family business. All the financial institutions rejected her loan request because of her unstable financial conditions and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Nona applied for a loan from MFO Credo. Her request was approved in the framework of the Start-Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva, permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses.  A loan of $1,600 will help Nona to purchase a secondhand car. Goderdzi will drive the car and they will transport fruits and vegetables to sell. This credit will be a great support for the family.

He is pictured here in a group of three One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 21 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Abel has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of KES 5,349 (shillings) for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\n\nAbel is married and has ten children. He is 55 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Abel has been a farmer for 27 years.  He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year, by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \n\nAbel joined One Acre Fund in 2011, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. Abel joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  \n\nBecause he likes being a leader and an active community member, Abel wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Abel has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and a Kiva representative.  \n\nWorking with One Acre Fund has improved Abel's life because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, is able to save money, and has been able to feed the family.

The individual farmers are not pictured here, but will be receiving an average loan of KES 5,349.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWycliffe is 38 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  He works as a farmer to provide for his seven children.  The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community activities such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Wycliffe described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send hs children to school.  \r\n\r\nHe also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWycliffe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a cow and a goat, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWycliffe\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with small-holder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Wycliffe and the Alpha Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, standing on the left.\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase his harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-06T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-04T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyongesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mwanamina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":315591,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315591}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642367,"name":"Naira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naira lives with her 9-year-old son in Yerevan.

She sells clothing for infants and children, a business she started 10 months ago after working as a saleswoman for another clothing business.  The experience she gained before gave her the confidence to open her own store.  She works alone from 11:00 in the morning until 8:00 in the evening.  The business generates enough income to pay family expenses and provide for her 9-year old son.  Flor is applying for a loan, part of which she will use to buy bulk supplies of merchandise--clothing for infants and children, accessories, diapers, wipes, etc.--and the rest to pay off an older loan.  She wants to expand her product range and meet the increased demand that she expects over the coming holidays.  Buying in bulk will increase her profit margin and help her to meet her biggest challenge, namely, competition from many similar businesses.  The investment will help Flor improve her business and expand her product range, goals that will, in turn, provide her with more income for supporting her and her family.

Erastus has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is pictured on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to his and the 85 other individual farmers represented by this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nErastus is married and has 13 children. He is 51 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Erastus has been a farmer for 22 years. Erastus described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nErastus first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Erastus joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, is an active community member, wants to help more farmers and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Erastus plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, save for the future, and buy a goat. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Erastus\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and was able to feed the family. \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Erastus and the Agape Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is one additional group leader in this photo who will be working with One Acre Fund but will not be a part of this Kiva group loan.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1483630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T00:00:10Z","loan_amount":5800,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erastus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Atrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":502806,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":502806}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642378,"name":"Christmas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christmas is 44 years old and wants a loan to buy more produce to sell.\r\n\r\nHe deals in produce and owns a store located in a busy trading centre in Hoima district, Uganda.

She is pictured here in a group of six One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 54 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Eunice has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nEunice is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  The community and other farmers know Eunice as friendly, and hardworking, and reliable, and trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  Other than farming, she is also involved in her community such as the women's group, and savings group, and prayer group.  Eunice described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEunice first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Eunice joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Eunice plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to repair the home, and save for the future, and buy a cow, and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Eunice\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, and has more farm training, and was able to save money.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEunice and the Kosiana Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clement","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jentrix ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseck","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aggrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":347685,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347685}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643097,"name":"Ramatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Ramatu.

She finished high school in Bogot\u00e1.  Upon finishing school, Luisa longed to study something medical, because when she was in school she belonged to a Red Cross group and helped the nurses with their work caring for children who needed it.  She was excused from classes to help.  And so, in this way, a great desire to serve others through nursing came to live in Luisa\u2019s heart and she dreamed of helping the elderly and special needs children as a nurse.  Because of this she would like to be like a little white angel in a nursing uniform that represents love and service to others.\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked hard to not leave behind her dream of becoming a nurse and because of this she is doing everything possible, thanks to God, to work hard and save in order to be able to attend nursing school.

He is pictured here in a group of 8 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 72 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Andrew has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 Kenyan shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew is 70 years old and has been a farmer for 40 years.  Andrew works as a farmer to provide for his 9 children. The community and other farmers know Andrew as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy. Other than farming, he is also involved in activities in his community such as the men's group.  Andrew described his harvest last year as excellent, but he hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Andrew joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods, earn enough to feed family, earn enough to feed the family and send the children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more One Acre Fund farmers. Andrew plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, buy a cow and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Andrew\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\t\t\r\n\r\nAndrew and the Bulala Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":5250,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cyprian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":454665,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642338,"name":"Poniyara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poniyara is 30 years old, married, and together with her husband, is raising three sons.
