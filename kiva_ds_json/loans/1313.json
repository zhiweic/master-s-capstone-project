This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"It was my older brother, Made, who taught me to carve sculptures. I saved until I had enough to start my own workshop, and now I'm able to offer employment to other carvers from my village. Balinese culture and tradition inspire my artwork. As the son of a master carver, it is easy and enjoyable for me to transfer my imagination into my work. Through my art I do hope to provide a good life and a better future for my family, especially for my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am now sick and need additional artisans to help me create the sculptures. I have many unfinished statues but, because I am sick, only my wife is helping me and we are running out of stock. It is taking a long time to carve the sculptures, especially because, besides preparing and doing finishing on our designs, now my wife also has to take care of me. I am requesting a loan to help me hire people to do the finishing of my sculptures.

He is a married father of three, the eldest of whom is 7. Mbeugou works for a private individual who gave him a truck and asks for a weekly payment; on the flip side, he pays him an average salary of 65,000 francs per month. His work consists of transporting fish to rather far areas of the country. With the long distances and since he\u2019s transporting fresh fish, he needs to have a vehicle in good condition. This is why he is seeking a loan to make some vehicle repairs. Mbeugou handles the daily expenses of his family. If the market is good, he can save a little money that has nothing to do with his weekly payment. He hopes to one day own his own vehicle, to work for himself, and to build a house."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1497742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair his truck.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T02:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T02:00:18Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mbeugou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650312,"name":"Kossi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\u00c2g\u00e9 de 36ans, Kossi revend des friperies au march\u00e9.

So, she decided to start a clothing and home product trading business with the loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.

She is very thankful and is hoping that her requested loan will be granted so that she can improve her living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to invest in the purchase of a home solar system to install on the top roof of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Prey Veng","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T06:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Savorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T10:56:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660735,"name":"Erdenesoyol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Erdenesoyol is 30 years old and lives with his wife and three daughters in a Ger, a traditional nomadic yurt, in Zavhan province, Mongolia.

They sell wax \"pagne\" (the traditional colorful cloth of western Africa), flour, spices, etc. \r\n\r\nAminata, the first woman pictured on the far left of the photo, plans to use her loan to purchase wax \"pagne\" cloth. She stocks up in the area and makes her retail sales for cash and credit to a customer base made up of both men and women. She hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA.

She is working together with her partner to replant them. This is why she is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers, compost, foliar sprays and to pay for the labor needed to clean the plantations and pick what she could save from getting ruined.

She has a high school education and she raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 5,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, Tajikhan now has one dairy cow and a 1.5 hectare plot of land on which she grows rice, corn and cotton.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Tajikhan turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy bulls to fatten up and sell on for a profit at the local market.  She plans to use the income from this to further increase her head of livestock, and she intends to prepare items for her daughters' dowries."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1499205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kydyrsha village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tajikhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4370},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4476},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4584},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4695},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4808},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4924},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5043},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5165},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5290},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5418},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5549},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":5678}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.53},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.62},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650304,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis lives in kakamega.

She has a high school education and she raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 34 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 3,000 som KGS.  Thanks to her hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows as well as a 1.17 hectare plot of land on which she grows cotton, corn and barley.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Arapatkhan has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" so she can buy bulls to fatten up and sell on for a profit at the local market.

He is a very decent man.  He loves nature and animals.  Starting in his early childhood, he helped his parents raise cattle.  Over time, he became more and more interested in cattle.  When he grew up, Gaffur firmly decided to go into the cattle business, i.e. buying and selling cattle.  Today, Gaffur's business is going well and is developing slowly but surely.\r\n\r\nGaffur would like to buy several more goats and sheep, which he will fatten over the winter and sell for a better price in the spring.  However, Gaffur doesn't have the financial means to buy the cattle, so he has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He is very thankful to MDO Arvand for its cooperation and support."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1493381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

She lives with her two kids and her in-laws on rent in a village which is about 35 kms from the main town of Imphal.\r\n\r\nHoineo sells vegetables in the town market and makes an income for the family.  She usually gets the vegetable supplies from other vegetable sellers and resells them.  She carries vegetable items in a basket and walks every day to the main town to sell. Sometimes, she goes to the capital market and sells the vegetables. The profit would have been more if she could manage her own farm and sell those vegetables. The meager income is not sufficient to manage their daily expenses as well as to provide good education for the kids.  She also needs to pay rent and take care of her aged in-laws who need utmost care at their age.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoineo will purchase vegetables like mustard greens, cabbages, peas, coriander leaves, and other local vegetables in stock and sell them. She is hopeful that with the additional income, the family will celebrate Christmas with joy. There were incidents where she and her husband could not afford to buy their kids anything for Christmas since they were short of money.\r\n\r\nHoineo always wanted to have her own house and also start her own vegetable farm. She is hopeful that her dream is coming closer with the Kiva tie. She is thankful for the unconditional support and love. Further, she adds that she will work very hard to achieve her dream, i.e., to own a house and never be worried again for paying house rent.

She is married and a mother many times over; she and her husband have seven children.  Her husband works as a trolleybus driver, four of her daughters are married and live separately, two of her daughters are in college and her youngest son is still in school.  Burulbubu has a high school education and raises livestock as the main source of income for her family.  She started this business 22 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 700 som KGS.  Her family is large, close-knit and hard-working.  Thanks to Burulbubu's dedicated work, their farm now has three dairy cows, two sheep and two goats.  Her monthly income is 2,800 som (KGS).  With the goal of developing her business further, Burulbubu has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to buy sheep to increase her head of livestock.  She plans to use this income to further increase her head of livestock and to save up money to build a new

Like many others, her family is in the business of raising cattle and producing milk.  Her husband is in the transportation business.   All Saodat's children help her with the business, which she has been in for almost 20 years.  Before that, she helped her parents raise cattle.  She was born and raised in a rural area.  Since animal husbandry is one of the main types of work in her village, Saodat has a great deal of experience in raising cattle.\r\n\r\nSaodat's goal is to provide her children with an education.

good family man and he has four children.  He and his family live in the village of Adrasmon.  Orif raises sheep which he fattens and sells.  He has been in this business for 25 years and he works very hard at raising cattle because he doesn't want his family to feel any financial limitations, even though they don't have enough money.  Orif keeps his cattle at his home.  He fattens them up and when they are ready for sale, he sells their meat to local butchers.  People use lamb to prepare traditional dishes.\r\n\r\nThis will be Orif's second loan to buy cattle.  He plans to sell a large quantity of meat in the winter.  He is very optimistic about this loan because people use a lot of meat in the winter with all the holidays and increased traffic in restaurants.  Orif plans to use the loan to buy cattle and increase the size of his herd.

Sustaining a family with a meager source of income is undeniably difficult for anyone but it is harder for Hoikhonei whose work site is about 5 kms away from the village. She walks there at the break of dawn to collect charcoal, comes back the same 5-km route back to the village, and boards a mini truck with her charcoal at the top of the mini truck off to the town market to sell the charcoal. She is the featured borrower member for Lily Lom and she is pictured with her hand raised.\r\n\r\nThe group is comprised of five hard-working women who all reside in a village which is about 15 kms from the town. The town is 62 kms from the capital town of Imphal. The group usually contributes an equal share and they took the land from the village chief on rent for a period of one year, so that they can cut down firewood and burn it to make charcoal. When the charcoal is ready to be sold, Hoikhonei walks every day at the break of the dawn to collect the charcoal from the charcoal-firing sites, carries the charcoal sack on her back, and walks to the village. Only occasionally does a vehicle ply that route; if one gets lucky, then one gets a ride. Otherwise, walking is the only option. From the village, Hoikhonei travels to the town market with the charcoal and sells it.\r\n\t\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Hoikhonei will contribute her share for taking the land on rent and start burning charcoal. She is sure to earn a good amount of money since charcoal is in great demand during winter season and the price is high unlike in off seasons. She says, she will also be able to pay new admissions for the kids without worrying where to get the money as she can sell her charcoal like hot cakes in this season. She thanks Kiva and says, do continue your co-operation with WSDS and make our life a happier one.  She is glad for the support and believes that this may bring success in life. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in the charcoal business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1498514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To take a portion of land on rent, cut wood, and burn charcoal for selling to support the family and kids' education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingkhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-24T19:37:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650354,"name":"Weedor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Weedor lives in Paynesville North Area, a suburb of the capital city of Monrovia.

Kitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. It is close to Uganda, and Mount Elgon, an extinct volcano which straddles the two nations and even has a peak at the Kenya-Uganda border. Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage.\r\n\r\nPeter is requesting a loan from Kiva to buy beehives to produce honey. He plans to use the income from his hives to invest in projects on his land. Peter is excited to start beekeeping, as he sees it as a good business that requires little work and has high rewards.

Due to the family\u2019s financial constraints, Aun is experiencing difficulties in paying her son\u2019s education fees, so she is requesting a loan of USD250 to add to her existing money in order to pay for his enrollment fees. \r\n\r\nAun is very happy and thankful for the loans available via  programs like Kiva that allow poor students to pursue higher education, and contribute to the future development of Cambodia.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for her son's enrollment fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Svay Rieng","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T16:27:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660780,"name":"Maria Luna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Luna is 42 years old, married, and has nine children.

The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be huge support for Mushegh as he will be able to continue the service that he provides and will be able to provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1498602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to pay for tools and equipment for furniture making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Jermuk town, Vayots Dzor region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-12-24T15:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T15:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mushegh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":13274.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":14451},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14841.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":14517.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":14739.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15126.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15350.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15430.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15666.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15774.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16394.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":16513.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":16542.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":17002.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17435.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":17264.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17915},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17967.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18186},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18614.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18804.7},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19092.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":19403.3},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":19691}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.59},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-28T23:53:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650424,"name":"Khairi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khairi is a 54-year-old married man from Rafah.
