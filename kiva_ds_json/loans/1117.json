He lives in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, with his 22-year-old wife, his children and his mother. The two children are ages six months and four years. Beka requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Beka\u2019s wife. She has health problems and is getting social help from government institutions.\r\n \r\nRecently, Beka requested a loan from Credo, to start up a family business. Beka has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Beka will open a plumbing shop. He already has a commercial space where he plans to open the shop. Beka will purchase plumbing materials at low cost and sell them, with a price markup, from his shop. He is planning to work as the seller himself, in order to decrease expenses. Beka is a very hard-working man, and he will try his best to make a good profit from his business.

is 59 years old. He lives in the Akhaltsikhe district with his 53-year-old wife, Mzia, and two children. \r\n\r\nIvane requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is Mzia\u2019s monthly salary. She is working at the local restaurant as a waitress. The small salary that she earns is not even enough for food for the family. \r\n\r\nIvane requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ivane will purchase raw materials for his cement workshop. He will start producing cement blocks and sell them to the resellers at a good price to earn additional income for the family. \r\n\r\n Ivane will have a new family business and will work hard to make it profitable. He will be reinvesting part of the profit in the same field, and another part will be used to improve the family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.49,"image":{"id":1347776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase raw materials for his cement workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Akhaltsikhe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T00:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T00:30:07Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":37.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":39.13},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":32.58,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749697,"comment":null},{"amount":37.56,"local_amount":37.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613603,"comment":null},{"amount":38.14,"local_amount":38.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":38.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857317,"comment":null},{"amount":39.13,"local_amount":39.13,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":39.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133969,"comment":null},{"amount":40.43,"local_amount":40.43,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":40.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107558,"comment":null},{"amount":41.18,"local_amount":41.18,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":41.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255103,"comment":null},{"amount":42.47,"local_amount":42.47,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019248,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-15T01:25:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557598,"name":"Josa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josa is 30 years old and has three children.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Adam will pay a toll for another tractor.

They live together in their house, made of good materials. Since she was very young, her economic sustenance has been raising organic cacao. Thanks to her husband, she acquired an agricultural plot of land that is five hectares in order to continue to independently harvest this profitable product. This is work that she does thanks to her parents, because since she was a girl, she helped them with small chores related to farming this product, for which demand is very good. At the beginning, the main inconvenience was that she did not have enough working capital to purchase a plot of land in order to have liquid income, so she had to rent farm land, but with the passing of the years and working more often than necessary, she was able to buy herself her own land.\r\n\r\nTo have commercial-quality production, she should put down organic fertilizer, and to cut down on the work she has to do, she should contract with laborers in the area to do work such as pull weeds and raise corn, so it is necessary to have working capital to pay for her staff as expected, which has been her main difficulty on many occasions.

is 31 years old. She lives in Ikalto village, Telavi district, with her 32-year-old husband, Besik, and her retired mother-in-law. Pikria requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nPikria and her husband are working, receiving small monthly salaries. She is an accountant at the local factory, and Besik is an artisan and works on house renovations for private orders. The family also runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a vineyard and a milk cow. The cow is milked every day to make dairy products, and these are sold with the harvested grapes, at local markets. The family receives some additional income -- specifically, Pikria\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s monthly pension.\r\n\r\nPikria requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Pikria has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Pikria will purchase a truck. Her husband will be driving the truck and transporting cargo on private orders. This will help them to earn additional income for the family. The profit will be used for expanding the agricultural business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up Loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He lives in a small village of Kobuleti District, with his mother. Mamuka requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMamuka has a 0.5-hectare plot of agricultural land, where vegetables and citrus are grown. He sells the harvested products at local markets. Mamuka\u2019s mother works as a cook at a local restaurant, and gets monthly income. They earn hardly enough to have food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMamuka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Mamuka has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

En este Banco Comunal hay variados negocios entre los cuales destacan socios que tiene una ruca, (vivienda tradicional de mapuches), artesan\u00edas  en lana y cuero, masajistas, turismo, proyectistas, jardineros, y venta de comidas en carros ambulantes. Zunilda, quien es nuestra entrevistada, nos cuenta que ella tiene un carrito de venta de comida, adem\u00e1s de vender artesan\u00edas, nos cuenta que su negocio lo empez\u00f3 hace 11 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, y que todo lo aprendi\u00f3 de su cultura, la mapuche; siempre en su vida estuvo presente el tejer a telar, hacer artesan\u00edas y cocinar comidas t\u00edpicas adem\u00e1s de tener un fog\u00f3n en donde se preocupa de rescatar la artesan\u00eda t\u00edpica de Chile, y tambi\u00e9n imparte cursos gratis para quienes quieren aprenderla.

","en":"Zunilda, who is on the far right of the photo, dressed in a white blouse and holding a green and brown bag, is a courageous woman who participates in the communal bank of Villarrica named Newn Tragun. In this communal bank, there is a variety of businesses. Members who stand out include those who have a ruca (a traditional home of the Mapuches), artists who work in wool and leather, massage therapists, those who work in tourism, designers, gardeners, and those who sell food out of street carts.\r\n\r\nZunilda, who is our interviewee, tells us that she has a little food cart, and she also sells handicrafts. She tells us that she started her business approximately 11 years ago, and that she learned everything from her culture, the mapuche culture. There was always present in her life crocheting, weaving, making handicrafts, and cooking typical foods, as well as having a stove where she brought to life the meals of Chile. She also teaches free classes to those who want to learn the trade. She has had many problems getting ahead because on the way she has lost her mother, her husband, and her son. In addition to being alone caring for her land, her siblings decided to leave to live in the city, looking for more work, and they abandoned her. This is why she has had to work alone and care for her land alone. Also, she has not had the water she needs because where she lives there is not plumbing for water. The only thing to do is go look for it in the lakes or take it out of wells. This is why her business has been affected. Because of this, she has to leave her land and go live somewhere else. With the loan that she will receive, she will be able to buy more supplies for her business such as wool and supplies to teach her classes for free. She hopes that things will go very well for her business even though she has to relocate. She knows that it could go very well for her. She has greatly enjoyed working with Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza for the loans she has requested and the responsibility of working with them.\r\n\r\n**Translator's note: The advertisement in the

He supports his parents because he is a very hard-working young man.  For the past year, Exson has been working on a plot of farmland that his parents gave him so that he could make income and improve his quality of life.  He decided to work the land because he has been learning techniques for growing top-quality produce such as organic cacao since he was a young child.  At first, he experienced some financial problems in buying supplies such as organic fertilizer and tools, and he needed support from his parents.  Every morning, Exson travels to his plot of land, which is an hour away from his town, and returns home before the sun sets as he lives in an area with small, dangerous roads. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the harvest season, Exson's cacao pods are dried in the sun and then sold to wholesalers in his region who evaluate their quality and offer him a final price.\r\n\r\nExson believes his work to be pretty hard but it also motivates him to improve himself and fulfill his own goals.  This is his first loan from Kiva and he is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that is being placed in him so that he can achieve his goals.

is a 44-year-old married mother with three children; the eldest is ten and the youngest three. She describes herself as a confident and determined mother. She is applying for a KES 10,000 loan through SMEP DTM that she will use to purchase kale, onions and potatoes as stock. Her major challenge is transport costs but she can see herself in the near future having a chain of grocery stores. The profits made from the business will be used to enhance her family's welfare. This is her first application for a loan. \r\n\r\nSMEP is a Deposit Taking Microfinance institution born out of an initiative of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). It began as a feeding programme to feed the Mathare slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya. NCCK realized that the poor needed to be self-reliant and economically empowered and the feeding programme was transformed into a micro-credit scheme. What started as a small project has grown into a deposit taking micro-finance institution that has a dream of providing many financial solutions to entrepreneurs.

Her house is made from wood and she lives there with her five children, two of whom are already adults and independent.  Hilda's business is selling breakfasts from a cart.  In the past, she was financially dependent on her husband as her job was caring for their children.  However, as the children grew up, she decided to work outside the home in order to improve the family's financial situation.\r\n\r\nHilda used some money that she and her husband had saved up to buy her fast-food cart which she sets up outside the local school and sells to her customers who are students and teachers.  She offers a wide range of quinoa-, maca root- and soy-based drinks as well as delicious bread filled with avocado, queso fresco (a soft, mild cheese), ham, etc.  Every day, Hilda wakes up very early so that she can prepare her food.  She does this because she likes offering her customers good-quality, fresh, good-tasting food.  She always thinks of her family's future as she works and her main long-term goals are to make enough money to re-build their home from solid building materials and to improve their quality of life.  She feels certain that she will achieve this as her children are her main motivation to keep going.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilda's first loan through Kiva and she is grateful for the trust that is being placed in her.  She hopes to invest in improving her business and to make each of her monthly repayments on time.

Her challenge is inadequate funds to stock her business and she describes her field of activity as competitive. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan application through SMEP DTM. SMEP is a Deposit Taking Microfinance institution born out of an initiative of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). It began as a feeding programme to feed the Mathare slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya. NCCK realized that the poor needed to be self reliant and economically empowered and the feeding programme was transformed into a micro-credit scheme. What started as a small project has grown into a deposit taking micro-finance institution that has a dream of providing many financial solutions to entrepreneurs. In future, SMEP plans to become a fully fledged Christian bank. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1347886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase bananas and kale as stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mombasa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.05 39.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373028083,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381817511,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390676236,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399921860,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410204798,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419969247,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429621790,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439847566,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-15T16:26:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557667,"name":"Neema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neema lives in Malindi area of Coast Province, Kenya.

lives in the Malindi area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is married and has seven school-going children. She owns a grocery store that has been running for twenty years. She is also employed and sells charcoal. She learned about Milango through friends, who invited her to the group, and she joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations. Her main challenges are competition and food perishability.

26, is a married, hardworking lady. She decided to work with her husband to support her family for a better future. The man shown in the photo is Muzammil\u2019s husband. Two years ago, they began sewing shoes in her house. They receive orders from the shoe factory and make enough to meet the needs of their children.

She lives with her husband in the Angoul\u00eame district of S\u00e9gou (the Republic of Mali's fourth administrative region).\r\n\r\nSalimata did not attend school for social reasons and thus at an early age started income-generating activities with her mother who sold clothes. After several years' apprenticeship at her mother's side she decided to build up a similar business by herself. She now has ten years' experience in this field and has a large network of customers, made up principally of retailers. Her shop is in the Ch\u00e2teau market near to the vegetable sellers, and access to the shop is easy. The strength of her sales is due to the quality of her clothing which is imported from Togo, Burkina and Nigeria, and also to her affordable prices. \r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her capital so that she can meet customer demand, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has had a relationship with the institution for the past 48 months. Having had four group loans and two individual loans, she is now on her third individual loan with which she is planning to buy five bundles of  \"pagnes wax\" (highly decorative and colourful pieces of fabric). She generally gets her supplies from Nigeria.\r\n\r\nSalimata sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up mainly of women, and with this loan she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA.

She lives with her husband and children in the Hamdallaye A district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of Mali). Not having attended school for social reasons, from an early age on she started earning a living alongside her mother, who used to sell condiments. After several years of this apprenticeship, she tried various business activities on her own (selling soap, cereals etc) before ending up selling coconuts. She has been in this business for 10 years and has a large customer base. Her success is due to her skill in running this business and also to her affordable prices in comparison to the competition.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her working capital and meeting customer demand, she has reached out to Soro Yiriwaso.

He was paid well. But then the industry started steadily declining, and work got sent overseas. Finally, he said, contract work just disappeared. \r\n\r\nAs work started drying up five years ago, Gary slowly turned his hobby and passion for attending motorcycle events into a business. \r\n\r\n\u201cBasically, it was out of desperation to find something to do to sustain myself,\u201d Gary said. \u201cI\u2019ve always gone to motorcycle events, but never as a vendor. But I had seen people doing it and knew it was something I could do.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt first, Gary sold just a few hats at a time, using a friend\u2019s table, and discovered that the \u201cMade in America\u201d label drew customers to his hats. \r\n\r\nGary recently officially opened a full-time business, doing business as Bud\u2019s Emporium and also as Daddy BUD\u2019s DooRags. He travels the Southern part of the nation, going to motorcycle events and music festivals, selling doorags \u2013 motorcycle riders\u2019 head coverings, and welder\u2019s style hats, face coverings, neck coolers, highway and motorcycle-related vintage-style signs, jewelry, as well as Android phones and computer tablets. He doesn\u2019t have a website, but he has a Facebook page where people can keep track of his locations: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DaddyBUDsDooRags \r\n\r\nGary took his first spin on a motorcycle when he was five years old, when a teen-aged neighbor was offering kids rides on his Cushman Eagle. That first ride turned a fascination into a passion and a lifestyle for Gary, who is riding the same Harley Davidson Shovelhead that he bought in 1973.\r\n\r\nGary was in South Texas, working the motorcycle shows during the winter months this year, when it became clear that his truck needed to be replaced. He learned about Accion Texas through a news report with Bill Clinton announcing the Kiva-Accion Texas partnership in Little Rock this March.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of Bill Clinton and even worked on some of his campaigns,\u201d Gary said. \u201cWhen I saw this announcement, it caught my interest.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe decided to apply for a loan to buy a used, 17-foot U-Haul box truck to replace his truck and to take his business to the next level.

They are starting their fourth loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. Their average age is forty and each has an average of three children. The ladies are engaged in various businesses including the sale of new and used clothing, shoes, tortillas, produce and snacks. Some own small retail storefronts.\r\n\r\nThe Trust Bank enjoys meeting together once each month. They make payments on their loan. They also receive valuable edcational training on various topics like family planning, economics, savings as well as the rights of children. They are able to implement what they learn into their lives which helps them create different patterns in their own lives as well as in their families.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a 50-years-old member of \u201cUvas\u201d who has benefited from her loans. Several years ago, she and her family began to manufacture and sell various types of shoes. Currently, she needs more capital for the business and so she is requesting a loan with Friendship Bridge. She will use the funds to increase her working capital and purchase materials for shoes. In this way, she will be able to meet the needs of her customers instead of stopping production.

Fueron ellos los que le ense\u00f1aron la actividad del cultivo de caf\u00e9 y hoy en d\u00eda lo practica con su esposo y agradecen a DIOS por el terreno que hoy cultivan ya que es propio gracias a una herencia que dieron los papas de su esposo el cual est\u00e1 ubicado a 50 metros de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto esto les permite y les da la facilidad para dar el mantenimiento necesario a su cultivo de caf\u00e9.\n\nHoy en d\u00eda Ana solicita ayuda para la compra de abono y fertilizantes para su cultivo de caf\u00e9 por medio del cual podr\u00e1 obtener una cosecha sana y la podr\u00e1 aprovechar al 100%.\n\nSus sue\u00f1os son de poder ver sus cultivos como los mejores de la zona ya que por medio de esto ella podr\u00e1 recibir mejores ingresos por la venta y la calidad de su producto para facilitarle a sus hijos la educaci\u00f3n, el pan de cada d\u00eda y otras necesidades que a diario de presentan.\n","en":"33-year old Sra. Mar\u00eda is hardworking and entrepreneurial. She is very keen to get on in life despite the difficulties that exist in the country. She is married and has five children; her eldest daughter will graduate this year as a computer technician, her second oldest only stayed in school to grade 3, the next two are in primary school, and the youngest is too small to go to school. Mar\u00eda herself did not complete primary education; she only attended up to grade 3. She couldn\u2019t continue her studies as her parents were poor and couldn\u2019t support her.\r\n\r\nIt was her parents who taught her how to grow coffee, and today she and her husband earn their living this way. They are grateful to God for the land that they cultivate since it is their own, thanks to her husband\u2019s parents who gave it to them. The land is located 50 metres from their house so it is easy for them to look after it.\r\n\r\nToday Mar\u00eda is seeking a loan to buy manure and fertilizer for the coffee plants so that she will be able to have a successful and healthy crop of coffee beans. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dream is to see her crop as the best in the area so that she can receive more income from it. Selling quality beans will help her pay for her children\u2019s education, daily food, and the other necessities of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1349145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy

Marta is the single mother of three children, two of whom are foster children. She is hardworking and entrepreneurial with a great desire to get ahead in life in spite of the difficulties that exist in the country. She has grown coffee since she was a young girl; her parents taught her how to weed the fields, prune, cut etc. Marta did not complete primary school as she only attended up to grade 2. Her parents were poor and couldn\u2019t support her. Her fields are located 500 metres from her house and she walks there daily.\r\n\r\nThe only help that Marta receives is from her family; they help her keep the crops healthy and safe from disease. She also has a small nursery where she grows coffee plants that will soon be for sale.\r\n\r\nToday Marta is seeking a loan to buy manure and fertilizer so that she will be able to have a successful and healthy crop of coffee beans. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her crop as the best in the area so that she can receive more income from it. Selling quality beans will help her pay for her children\u2019s education, daily food, and the other necessities of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1349160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy manure and fertilizer for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-05-12T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-11T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-13T19:52:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":557938,"name":"Khachik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khachik is 50 years old and lives with his wife in Tsovagyugh village, which is in the Sevan area.

Pinnacle utilizes specially designed surface cleaning equipment, which fully contains and recaptures contaminants while simultaneously filtering and recycling wash water.

To accomplish this process, the water temperature is raised to 200 degrees, which helps loosen grease, dirt, gum and many other stains.  \r\n\r\nA friend recommended Gregory to Accion Texas Inc. in Austin and he was able to obtain a loan to purchase the hot water high-pressure cleaner that improved his business.

All her life she has worked on a farm with cattle.  Because of this, she has gained much experience fattening cows and bulls.  For 20 years, she and her husband have worked fattening cattle because they know the ins and outs of caring for livestock.  Her husband works as a security guard at a local farm but his salary isn't enough to live on.  So each morning, Tufajon milks her cow and takes the milk to the city to sell.  At the moment, this additional income is not enough for Tufajon's goals so she wants to take out of a loan  to buy a more cattle to increase her income.  She plans to use the money from selling the cattle to make repairs to her home since it needs it.  She relies on Arvand's support to realize her dream.

They live in her parents' house. Her parents have always helped her out because she is their only daughter. \r\n\r\nNorma grows organic cacao on three hectares of land, which she purchased with Cesar's help. There is a lot of demand for organic cacao in the area, and they often hire local workers to help them with chores to maintain the plants such as pulling weeds, spreading organic manure, and harvesting.

She used it to purchase building materials for housing construction. She paid off the loan completely with the income she has earned from her agricultural business. After this loan, Min is pursuing her next Kiva loan to use for the wedding of her daughter. Traditional weddings in Cambodia have a lot of special ceremonies and other events, which will incur more expenses for the couple\u2019s family. The actual wedding ceremony of Cambodians take place continuously for three days and three nights. Since there are a lot of factors to be considered at present like time, money, etc. Cambodian weddings are completed in one single day instead of three. Still, some parts of the country arrange the party for three days.

She was able to save enough money from this to stop making food and to open her current business so that she could be at home with her young daughter.\r\n\r\nHer relatives helped her set up a space in her house facing the street and buy some merchandise to test the business.

She has had her business for 15 years in the city she is from. She began her small business buying articles on sale and selling them in her hometown of Carmen de Bolivar, a municipality located in the department of Bolivar. She started the business because she has always liked managing her own money and be autonomous. Similarly, she began her own tailor business making dresses her closest family members. Little by little she has been able to increase her income and today with expectations to grow she has been involved with the Foundation Mario Santa Domingo to get a Kiva credit. This is her first loan with the organization. She will use the money to buy fabric, thread, and other materials to elaborate her work and also invest in articles such as perfume, clothing, and lotion for women. With this investment her business will grow because it allows her to purchase in greater volume at a better price.  Her long term goal is to have a point of exhibition in order to impress her market and concentrate on her clients.
