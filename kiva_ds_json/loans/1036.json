While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials.  They sell these to junk shops for a small profit.  Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather large quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries such as factories.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 1000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 50,000 PHP.  She will be incorporating this loan with her existing revolving fund that is used to buy recyclable materials from collectors.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business and she dreams of becoming a successful businesswoman.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business.  She also draws strength and inspiration from their fellowship and from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Further, as Umsunai is a seamstress by education, she works with sewing national clothing, which brings in a small income to the family. Having started with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS) the business currently brings in around 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of handmade products. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Umsunai turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of fabrics and materials for sewing, to increase the turnover of the business.

She has requested a loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nLeah was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"I heard about Juhudi from a Juhudi officer.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits.

When asked how this loan would benefit her family, Elizabeth replied, \"Acquire another dairy animal to boost production.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Elizabeth owns \"cow\" and \"poultry\" but does not own \"pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile.\" \r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower does not have \"mosquito net, electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.\"\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather

Her biggest challenge is: 'Lack of funds to boost production.' The animal on the farm is named, 'Tetat'. Lilian was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Learned about Juhudi from a friend.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to invest in agriculture, through credit.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?,' Lilian replied, 'increased income from increased milk production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Lilian owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle, automobile,' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower has in the household, 'mosquito net, TV,' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

Over time, he planned to open a small food stand. His sister-in-law used to own one, but it closed when she moved to the capital. Fran decided to open another, similar to his sister-in-law's in order to improve it. This business has gone very well for him. His wife helps him to manage the store. It is the only one of its kind in their town, so they always need to acquire merchandise in bulk. Now, Fran wants to restock his store, since the Christmas and New Year's season depletes it. \r\n\r\nFran belongs to the support group \"Cruz de Espinas\" (Cross of Thorns). This is his fourth loan with MFP.

She has lived for the past three years in the house which she bought together with her 2 daughters, Gabriela and Yovana.  She owns 4 purebred cows and declares \"my animals are my most prized possession\".  She tends them with great care every morning since she obtains an average of 36 litres a day from them.  She says that if her cows become pregnant, she sells any male calves or bulls which they may have at the cattle market in the city of Jauja.  This is because most of her earnings come from milk production and one of the major producers of tinned goods buys the milk from Marlene's cows every day.  As a result, she feels happy and wants to increase her income.  She has already started to grow her own good quality alfalfa to eat and, now that her cows are pregnant and their production has fallen, she is thinking of buying an additional purebred cow so as to maintain the same level of production and produce more litres of milk, which she thinks is possible.

trabajo de Dina consiste en vender abarrotes y art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como cereales, arroz, pan, huevos, aceite, leche y gaseosas. Compra cada 3 d\u00edas al por mayor en el mercado principal de la ciudad obteniendo sus productos a precios c\u00f3modos lo cual le ayuda a obtener algunos centavos adicionales como ganancia. Tiene su bodega instalada en su casa, trabaja en esta actividad desde hace 3 a\u00f1os y desde que empez\u00f3 siempre ha trabajado sola. Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que le da independencia para hacer otras actividades, lo que no le gusta es que siempre hay personas que quieren ir a solicitar alg\u00fan producto a cr\u00e9dito y en la fecha establecida del pago, no lo hacen, por ese motivo prefiere vender ahora todo al contado.

She is single and has two children, ages 8 and 2, who live with her and her sister-in-law and her children. Dina sells groceries and essential goods such as grains, rice, bread, eggs, oil, milk, and sodas. Every three days, she buys at wholesale in the city's main market at prices that allow her to make a few cents profit. \r\n\r\nShe set up her store in her house three years ago and works alone. She enjoys that her business leaves her free to do other activities. It bothers her, though, that some customers buy on credit but don't pay on time; therefore, she prefers to sell for cash. She hopes to grow her business, since she feels young, and hopes to keep working as she has done in the past. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan cycle with MFP, and she thanks the people who have provided capital. She likes working with her communal bank because the members have shown themselves to be responsible.

With this, she\u2019ll provide more comfort for her customers while they are in her salon and will continue to capture their patronage.\r\n\r\nShe opens for business Monday to Sunday from 9 in the morning to 9 at night and with all this effort is managing to position herself in the marketplace; her customers are mainly housewives, employees, young adults and adults in general who also bring their children to be cared for with the delicate touch Nelcy\u2019s hands produce in their personal appearance.\r\n  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":649.76,"image":{"id":1273953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a hair washing sink, a chair and a barber shop station.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T17:10:06Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelcy  Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":99879},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":103967},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106393},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108875},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111416},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114015},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116676},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":119398},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":122184},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127197}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.45,"local_amount":99879,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":101408.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071728,"comment":null},{"amount":59.81,"local_amount":103967,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":105558.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497943,"comment":null},{"amount":61.2,"local_amount":106393,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":108021.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527756,"comment":null},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":108875,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":110541.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928504,"comment":null},{"amount":64.09,"local_amount":111416,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":113121.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705656,"comment":null},{"amount":65.59,"local_amount":114015,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":115760.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967948,"comment":null},{"amount":66.87,"local_amount":116676,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:20:37Z","rounded_local_amount":118462.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.24,"payment_id":399817142,"comment":null},{"amount":212.13,"local_amount":368779,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":374424.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T16:48:47Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517168,"name":"Marcos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Marcos tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, es un se\u00f1or muy trabajador, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado con Sandra, tienen 2 hijos, viven en la ciudad de Coronel Oviedo desde hace 15 a\u00f1os.

She lives in a house that\u2019s her property and that she inherited from her father.  Natividad\u2019s activity is selling groceries and foodstuffs.  To do so, she opened a grocery store inside her house because economic need was severe and the stipends or child support she got wasn\u2019t enough.  She decided to start this business six years ago and this time has served her to grow and expand.  She has many customers most of which are neighbors who she tends to with help from her mother occasionally.  She considers her business to be quite profitable because it\u2019s well-received and it\u2019s in high demand; it yields good profits.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activity because it allows her to socialize with her neighbors and have more friends and to be able to talk about topics she\u2019s interested in; she also likes to feel occupied and to be a productive person.\r\n\r\nThanks to her income she\u2019s able to cover her household needs.  On the other hand, she does not like it when her customers are late making their payments on the loans credit she gives for her products\u2019 sales.  She\u2019s thinking about not providing this credit any longer in order to have more cash on-hand and invest in expanding the business.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #12 and she feels happy about having this support to make business progress so she commits to make her payments punctually.

Adiaratou hopes to make a monthly profit of 85 000 francs, which will be used to help her husband meet the family's needs, to repay the loan and to reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1275732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101986.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636379,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101986.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678288,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":101986.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T12:45:30Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517045,"name":"Tuvshuntugs","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tuvshuntugs is 22 years old and lives with her husband and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

and lives with her youngest son who is 13 years old.  She has a high school education and got married shortly after finishing school.  Makhbuba is, by nature, a very kind person.  Her neighbors love her and support her, and they have nothing but positive comments to say about her.  In early 2012, in order to provide a source of income for her family, Makhbuba began selling food products, a business she started with an initial sum of 5,000 KGS.\n\nThanks to her hard work, Makhbuba has a store, and she makes a monthly profit of about 15,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to increase her working capital.  She will use this loan to purchase inventory of food items for her store. Her priority is to take care of her son and to ensure that he receives a good education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":963793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase inventory of food items for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Isfana town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-14T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-13T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Makhbuba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7459},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7548},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7711},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7879},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8049},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8224},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8402},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8584},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8770},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8960},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9154},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9260}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.5,"local_amount":7459,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":7510.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459757,"comment":null},{"amount":160.4,"local_amount":7548,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7600.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012528,"comment":null},{"amount":163.86,"local_amount":7711,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7764.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754880,"comment":null},{"amount":167.43,"local_amount":7879,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":7933.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458897,"comment":null},{"amount":171.04,"local_amount":8049,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8105.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863039,"comment":null},{"amount":174.76,"local_amount":8224,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-23T08:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8281.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631563,"comment":null},{"amount":178.54,"local_amount":8402,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8460.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495450,"comment":null},{"amount":182.41,"local_amount":8584,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8643.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743690,"comment":null},{"amount":768.06,"local_amount":36144,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":36395.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013904,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T09:36:29Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T09:56:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517054,"name":"Aurelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aurelia is married and works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a food vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from raising livestock and a variety store business.

Yulya has secondary education, and got married right after graduating from high school. She is a very kind person and has a good reputation among her neighbours, who like and support her.\n\nTo provide a source of income for her family, Yulya started selling women's clothing in early 2012, launching her business with a sum of 80,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, the business is currently worth 130,000 KGS, with monthly profits totalling roughly 15,000 som (KGS). In order to continue developing her business, Yulya has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to purchase clothing for teenagers for a new store she has just rented. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business by expanding the range of merchandise in her shop, as well as increasing the number of shops she operates. Her priority is to care for her daughter and provide him with quality

 se dedica a la venta de comidas en su domicilio ubicado en el municipio de Soledad, donde habita con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 3 hijos; su negocio inici\u00f3 por tradici\u00f3n familiar, pues de su padre aprendieron \u00e9l y sus hermanos,  la preparaci\u00f3n y la venta de alimentos y hoy sus hijos tambi\u00e9n trabajan con Andr\u00e9s. Su principal producto es el famoso arroz de lisa que usualmente lo preparan en la costa Caribe,  lavando  las lisas muy bien y cocin\u00e1ndola en agua hirviendo con sal durante 10 minutos, para luego secarlas y escurrirlas y cuando pierdan el exceso de calor, se desmenuzan quitando todas las espinas, poniendo al fuego en una cazuela el hogao, las lisas y el arroz; de esta manera  cuando comienza a hervir,  se incorpore el agua, sal y pimienta ,  hasta que el arroz est\u00e9 en su punto y listo  para servir bien caliente, espolvoreado con el perejil picado.  \nEste delicioso producto por el cual Andr\u00e9s es muy reconocido es con el que ha logrado reconocimiento en el sector donde tiene su puesto de ventas. En su proceso participa su esposa desde la madrugada para que la venta inicie desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la 11 del mismo d\u00eda, y desde los lunes hasta los domingos. Sus principales clientes son los trabajadores del sector, que lo compran en porciones y que cada d\u00eda aumentan m\u00e1s. Esto es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1  arroz, salsas, pescado y verduras, insumos con los cuales prepara su producto , el planea comprarlo en mayor volumen, para disminuir los costos de su compra y ganar un poco mas. \n","en":"Andr\u00e9s makes a living selling food in his home in the town of Soledad, where he lives with his wife and three children.  His business began as a family tradition because he and his siblings learned food preparation and sales from their father, and now Andr\u00e9s's children also work with him.\r\n\r\nHis main product is the famous \"arroz de lisa\" [rice with mullet fish] that's usually prepared on the Caribbean coast.  The mullet is washed very well, cooked for 10 minutes in boiling salted water, then drained, dried, flaked, and deboned when it's no longer very hot.  The mullet is heated in a pot with rice and \"hogao\" [or \"sofrito,\" an aromatic mixture of tomato and onion].  When it begins to boil, water and salt and pepper are added until the rice is done and ready to serve piping hot, sprinkled with chopped parsley.\r\n\r\nThis delicious product for which Andr\u00e9s is very well known has given him recognition in the area where he has his sales stall.  His wife participates in the process from early in the morning so sales can start at 6 a.m. until 11 on the same day, from Monday through Sunday.  His main customers are workers in the area who buy by the portion and who are increasing every day.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason he's requesting a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it he'll buy rice, salsas, fish, and vegetables, the ingredients he uses to make his dish.

is from the village of Ratevani. He is single, and lives with his family: parents and a sister. \n\nHe requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his agricultural business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\n\nAmiran works at local road building, and gets a small monthly salary. In addition, the family grows maize and haricots on their agricultural land, and sells the harvested products at the local open market. In addition, Amiran breeds rabbits and runs small animal husbandry business.\n\nAmiran requested an agricultural loan from Credo to start-up a small-scale agricultural business. His loan request was approved, as a result of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to loans, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \n\nWith the received credit, Amiran will cultivate more land, and sow maize and haricot there. Specifically, with the loaned amount, he will rent a tractor for tilling the land, and purchase seeds for sowing. He will work hard on the plot during summer period to get a good harvest in early fall.\n\nAmiran will sell the harvested maize on the local open market.  As a result of the Kiva loan, the family will get additional income and will use it for renovating the house, which is old and damaged.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":584.8,"image":{"id":1272154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high-risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ramaz will begin trading in maize, dried fruits and cheese. In particular, he will buy these products from wholesalers and resell them at a better price in the capital city. Ramaz thinks this will be profitable and he will be able to increase the income of the family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

This borrower has a mosquito net in the household, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used

Eva is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyenjojo in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past year, Eva has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Eva has requested a loan of 200000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh food such as raw bananas to resell, and will help Eva generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Eva hopes that in the future she will be able to give her younger sibling a better education. \r\n\r\nEva is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Then, with the help of her husband, Amalya sells that cheese in local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the only source of income for this family is agriculture, Amalya works hard to gather high income and cover the family's daily costs. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for her to sustain the family and at the same time cover operational costs, so Amalya has applied for this loan. \r\n\r\nWith the help of the loan, Amalya will purchase forage for feeding the livestock and will be able to save more money for the family's well being.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":383,"image":{"id":1275804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

For the past two years, Veronica has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells basic commodities, such as milk, bread, sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, Veronica has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. She will use the loan to purchase inventory in greater quantity to resell in her shop. This use of the loan will help Veronica to generate greater profits, and to pay school fees for her young brother. Veronica hopes that, in the future, she will be able to work hard to see that she pays her brother's school fees, up to university. \r\n\r\nVeronica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Sarah is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyenjojo, in the Mubende region of Uganda. For the past year, Sarah has been working hard to manage her small business; she sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, Sarah has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to give a better education to her young siblings. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1275807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Her biggest challenge is, 'lack of reliable labor, forcing her to employ casual laborers who are more expensive. She will use the loan to buy a water tank.\r\n\r\nPauline was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because she wanted a loan to buy a water tank and the terms from Juhudi Kilimo are favorable.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Microfinance can help small-scale farmers to acquire assets for farming.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is family expenses. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Pauline replied: 'The family will have access to clean water which she will harvest from the rain.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Pauline owns the following: 'cow, poultry, motorcycle,' but does not own 'pig, pump, bicycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards, based on this loan. This borrower has in the household, 'mosquito net, electricity, running water, TV, DVD,' but does not have 'solar power, sewing machine'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a

escuela primaria, trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a sus padres desde muy joven y se cas\u00f3 ilusionada, sin embargo su matrimonio no result\u00f3 como ella esperaba por lo que ahora est\u00e1 separada y tiene 3 hijos  que son independientes y cada uno tiene su vida definida. Para Blanca el mayor obst\u00e1culo que atraves\u00f3 fue la separaci\u00f3n de su esposo, pues ella tuvo que buscar el sustento para ella y sus hijos en medio del dolor, lo cual fue posible gracias al esp\u00edritu emprendedor de ella. Actualmente vive sola en la Parroquia de Bomobol\u00ed de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nBlanca se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos de manera ambulante desde hace 8 a\u00f1os, actividad que desarroll\u00f3 gracias a la recomendaci\u00f3n de una gran amiga que le acompa\u00f1\u00f3 a inscribirse como consultora de belleza. Cada d\u00eda visita clientes en su mayor\u00eda mujeres para asesorarles sobre los productos que necesitan, adem\u00e1s paralelamente en su casa tiene algunos pollos que alimenta y cuida para su posterior venta. Blanca est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercader\u00eda que pueda vender a precios competitivos a sus clientes, pues si compra mayor cantidad de productos, mayor ser\u00e1 el descuento que reciba y adem\u00e1s puede tener los productos en stock para atender inmediatamente las solicitudes de sus clientes. Blanca espera que este incremento en sus ingresos pueda mejorar su calidad de vida y as\u00ed abastecer sus necesidades de salud, alimentaci\u00f3n, vestimenta en el futuro. Blanca agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por el apoyo que le han brindado ya que para ella no ha sido f\u00e1cil invertir en su negocio, justamente por la falta de capital. ","en":"Blanca\u2019s a 49-year-old woman who grew up in a family of scarce economic resources but that was able to support her schooling through elementary school level.  She worked helping her parents from a very young age and married with much hope.  However, her marriage did not turn out like she expected and she\u2019s now separated.  She has three children who are now independent and each has their life clearly defined.\r\n\r\nBlanca\u2019s separation from her husband was the greatest obstacle she\u2019s faced because she had to find a way to support herself and her children amidst the pain which she did thanks to her great entrepreneurial spirit.  She currently lives alone in Bomobol\u00ed Parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a province in Ecuador that\u2019s undergone sustained growth in the last few years.  Its capital is a city whose most noteworthy and attractive feature is its delicious fruit and the local cuisine.  It also has considerable commerce because it\u2019s become a land port for commercial exchange between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions.  It also has several tourist attractions that accompanied by its warm climate draw many national and foreign tourists.  Because of this, most of its inhabitants carry out activities that are commercial or service oriented for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nBlanca has been working selling cosmetics from place to place for the last 8 years, an activity she developed thanks to a recommendation from a great girlfriend of hers who accompanied her to sign up as a beauty consultant.  She visits her customers, for the most part women, every day to advise them about the products they need.

Mr. Ganbat was employed as a driver initially by a particular company in 2012 and now works as head of the maintenance department. Before working on a full-time basis, he was running an automobile repair service. In 2009, his wife\u2019s brother gave them a house and he has rented it to others since that time. Currently, the family lives in his close friend\u2019s backyard and wants to move to their own house. The house, which was given by his wife\u2019s brother, has deteriorated over the years and hasn\u2019t received any repair for at least four years. So he is requesting a loan of 2,800,000 MNT to install a  vacuum door, windows, and a ceiling and to repair the bathroom. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable place, which will motivate their hard work. Most importantly, the vacuum door and windows are an effective barrier for the upcoming strong storm and frost, enabling the house to keep its warmth versus the economic impact on coal consumption by the family. The family will burn less coal, thus contributing to the efforts against air
