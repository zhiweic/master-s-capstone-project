In the future, Mrs. Afi would like to add the sale of bazins (traditional articles of clothing) and to ensure her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1137461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy pagnes (colorful African cloth) and ladies' purses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Adidogom\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23004},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23349},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":23699},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":24055},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24416},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":24782},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25154},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25531},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25914},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26303},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":26697},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":27096}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.42},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.16,"local_amount":23560,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":24096.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294469614,"comment":null},{"amount":49.64,"local_amount":25900,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26489.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301523351,"comment":null},{"amount":50.31,"local_amount":26250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26847.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308696075,"comment":null},{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":26600,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":27205.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315520567,"comment":null},{"amount":46.54,"local_amount":24280,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":24832.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323761265,"comment":null},{"amount":53.07,"local_amount":27690,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-17T10:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":28320.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331721852,"comment":null},{"amount":53.78,"local_amount":28060,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-27T09:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":28698.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339644763,"comment":null},{"amount":50.68,"local_amount":26440,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":27042.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347200872,"comment":null},{"amount":54.91,"local_amount":28650,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29302.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364664849,"comment":null},{"amount":119.93,"local_amount":62570,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63994.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373050117,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T14:16:50Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:59:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448508,"name":"Nino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nino is 39 years old.

Her husband, Manuel, is a taxi driver who offers a private, on-call service in the local area; they have 2 children together who are at public school. Maria started the business because her husband's work did not cover the family expenses, so she decided to hire a unit on a large plot of land. It has been a year since then and she has many regular customers. At the moment, she doesn't have any help so she does all the preparation and serving herself. She opens for a half day from 7:30am for breakfasts until 3:00pm for lunches. She will use this loan to buy produce for preparing meals. Maria hopes to continue with her business so that she will be able to hire 2 people to help her with serving the customers, and then she will be able to divide her time better in order to spend some

She has been running a reinforced carton dividers business for more than 10 years, in which many important companies pay her for labor charges as Carmen and her family of 7 children carry out the work and earn money for doing so. She also runs a cafe selling soft and alcoholic drinks on the weekends, and she also hires out washing machines for a day at a time. Within her home, she lives and breathes the concept of 'work to earn' and that is the impression received by everybody who visits the home of this hardworking 60 year old woman. Although she has never studied much, as a widowed head of her household she has succeeded in helping her children to make good progress and in maintaining  a constant income to ensure their well-being. Carmen has a refrigerator and a music player to create a good atmosphere for those who come to drink beer at her home. All of her businesses are successful as she has the same customers for each, and she uses one business to promote her others. Recently, 2 of her 3 washing machines developed technical faults and she needs to repair them in order to continue offering this service. Consequently, she is applying for a loan - her first - from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which she will use to buy 3 washing machines and to repair the 2 requiring maintenance. Her strong client base, her effective management of her business, along with her skill and capacity for work means that this loan will be successfully invested and will be a real help to

is Sabina, 48, resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSabina operates a furniture-making business. She buys raw materials, specifically bamboo, for making bamboo sets, tables, and beds. Her finished products are displayed in a place where they can be easily seen by customers, and when someone buys a piece they will deliver it to the place where the product will be displayed. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw materials needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSabina dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business and she also hopes to reach more customers in the future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1137960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To pay for raw materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3491.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303441,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3492.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356172,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2792.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114271,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":698.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350319,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-13T06:16:59Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448688,"name":"Gerito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerito is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She has a special place and all necessary conditions to open salons for shaping and massage. To implement these goals, she needs to purchase special equipment for these salons, too. This loan will help Mariam to reach these goals and promote her business. \r\nMariam lives with her husband, a police officer, and 2 children. Development of the salon is important for this purposeful woman to gather more income from the business, which allows her to save for her children\u2019s future educational costs. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1136302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for furniture, equipment for hair dressing, shaping and massage salons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Yerevan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2012-07-12T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-11T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":448683,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is 56 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Her husband is Angelito, a driver. Together with her husband, Marissa  manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses and for their children.\r\n\r\nMarissa maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange.  When a customer orders something, the dealer pays cash for the product and then gives it to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the customer catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are collecting as their income.  Marissa's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan.   She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarissa fervently hopes that her children will be able to finish college. She also hopes to have more income. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work every week.

They're friendly, kind and very charismatic women who strive everyday in order to get their families ahead. They also keep their people's culture and tradition. They live in various areas of the town of Cuenca, which has been a World Cultural Heritage site since December 1999. Its geography is rugged and it's bathed by four rivers. It's home to great artisans; its gastronomy is very diverse and captures the taste buds of both natives and foreigners.\r\nOne of the members of this group is Margoth. She lives in the Las Pencas area of the town of Cuenca. She's 52 years old and married, and from her marriage she conceived four children. Two of her children are married and live independent lives; her two youngest children attend one of the town's schools. Her husband works as a private employee.

He lives in a house bought 10 years ago in the town of Huancas, with his two children, Marlene and Joseph.\r\nEvery morning he and his wife devote themselves to the trades they learned as children, agriculture and livestock. They use his wife's land and that of others from whom they rent when needed.  They grow potatoes, corn, beans, flaxseed, lupine and other products native to the area. \r\n\r\n\"There are seasons in which we have to hire staff to help us plant,\" he says.  At each harvest he sells his products to food stockers in the city, who take them to different cities of Peru. As he works and manages their crops, his wife cares for their animals.  They have cows, bulls, and sheep, which they fatten and then sell to butchers. Additionally they extract 12 liters of milk which they sell to a dairy processing factory.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the solidarity group \"Cross of Thorns\" and this is his seventh loan with MFP.  In all these years, thanks to these loans, he has been successful in his business and his personal life; thus, he is grateful. He promises to be timely with his payments.

She buys these animals and then sells them at a higher price to the butchers who always visit her home.  RIght now, Gudelia doesn't have many animals owing to a lack of capital.  However, she hopes to acquire the quantity she needs to make more profits.\r\n\r\nGudelia belongs to the 'Las Abejitas' (Little Bees) community bank and this is her first loan from MFP.

He says that he experienced many problems in getting where he is today: in a position of financial stability.  His potato crops would often fail and not grow.  \"There were harvests which earned me money and others where I lost the money I had invested\", he says.  For this reason, he started sowing quinoa, barley and other crops in which he invested less and earned more.  His harvests are well known in the valley which means that he has regular buyers who come to his village every season.  Right now, Antenor would like to improve the quality of his produce so that he can make more profits.  He hopes to save up enough because he also works raising animals such as sheep, pigs and cows, which he fattens and then sells at a higher price.\r\n\r\nAntenor belongs to the 'Cruz de Espinas' (Crown of Thorns) solidarity group and this is his tenth loan from MFP.

It is located in a good movement area and he has many loyal customers but also needs more support to cover the workshop costs.\r\n\r\nManal is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing spare parts that are necessary for fixing electric generators. This will increase the amount of work and improve the family's income which will enable Manal and her husband to live in better conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see for fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

This is why Marilu will take the reins of the business. She lacks working capital, since in July there is more demand from customers, who place orders for the suits they will wear in the festivities that will take place during this month. What she needs most are fabrics in various colors and textures, as well as thread of various colors. They also make very colorful tablecloths (like the one in the photo).

is a 54-year-old married man living in Talibon, Bohol, Philippines, who has been a fisherman for several years now. He is also running a guso or seaweed farming business. Eucheuma, a red alga, endemic to Philippine marine waters, is the twentieth-century wonder plant.

He has been involved in this occupation since 2002. \r\n\r\nAs he becames an expert in these instruments, he will be able to respond rapidly to his clients' demands. In order to better support his family, Nader works in parallel at a local company. He suffers from a bad financial situation; that\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s asking today for a loan from Kiva Partner Ameen s.a.l to improve his business by purchasing new musical instruments. He confirms that the loan will help him raise his income by 25%. One of his greatest dreams is to satisfy all the needs of his child.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profits. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to meet her daily needs and her children's educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nRosita hopes to be able to expand her business soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

aged 31, has been working in the construction business for three years. He does his work with his building team, providing his services around Siem Reap province, where he lives with his wife and four dependent children. From this business, Sok earns an average of USD $4 each day. Sok\u2019s challenge is that he doesn\u2019t have another business to provide a consistent income when there are no orders from customers of his construction business. \r\n\r\nSok really needs some capital for personal construction needs because his present house is not sufficiently strong to live in.
