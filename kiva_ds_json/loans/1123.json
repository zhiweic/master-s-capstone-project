is from Krashen village in the Shirak region, where she lives with her husband and son. Together with her husband, Nashkhun is engaged in agriculture. She keeps 4 cows, 14 sheep, 2 pigs, 20 chickens and 10 colonies of bees and also cultivates wheat and barley. Nashkhun gets milk and other milk products and her husband sells the gathered agricultural products locally. The income from selling is very important for Nashkhun and her husband to be able to sustain the family's life.

He lives in Terjola district with his wife Teona, his parents and retired grandfather. Mirian had requested for a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from their agricultural business. In particular, they have two milk cows and a vineyard. The cows are milked to make cheese. From the harvested grapes they make wine and vodka. All the products are sold locally at the markets. Mirian's grandfather's monthly pension is additional income for the family.\r\n\r\nMirian requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Mirian has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Mirian will purchase stocks of plumbing equipment and open a plumbing shop.

 lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is single with four children, all of whom attend school. She is not looking after any additional family members.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling charcoal and banana leaves in the market for 10 years, working seven days a week. She does not have an additional source of income. \r\n\r\nZaina has requested a loan of UShs 200,000 from MCDT- SACCO to enable her to buy more bags of charcoal for sale. Her challenges include seasonality and transportation. Her dream is to open a second outlet. She joined MCDT because, unlike other financial institutions in her area of residence, she did not need collateral to access loans. She rents a house with access to both electricity and piped water.

The loan will be used to purchase more hair extensions and a dryer for the salon, and will help Sarah to generate greater profits and buy more hair cosmetics and hair braids. Sarah hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a bigger salon. \r\n\r\nSarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

from Zimbabwe! This is 36-year-old Sukoluhle from Bulawayo. She is married with three children, two who attend school. Sukoluhle runs a manufacturing business producing bedspread covers, seat covers, curtains and children's dresses. The business has been in operation for four years. Sukoluhle says the main challenges she faces are accessibility to funding and a stable market to sell her goods. Sukoluhle has requested a loan of $500 to order more raw materials. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to increase her business capacity and will also enable her to pay for other household expenses.

She has a small store in her own home and stocks it with products, often ones that her clients request. She offers special discounts through her sales catalogues. \r\nShe mainly sells on credit but also accepts cash. She works every day of the week from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. Her main clients are located in her neighbourhood and the surrounding area. Edilma's business has grown bit by bit, first in clientele and then in infrastructure. Her most important assets are her display cases and cooler. She is applying for a loan on Kiva, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy clothing for men and women, children's shoes, and perfume.

The store offers Indian specialty products to the growing Indian community in Clovis, CA (there are now over 50,000 people of Indian descent living in the Central Valley).\n\nAlmost a year after opening, the business is still getting established but, because the store is located in a growing part of town and a new Sikh temple is being built just a few blocks away, the couple expect business to continue to grow. Rajvinder is there 7 days a week, 10 hours a day, to keep the doors open. Jesbir and their children also help when they are not working.\n\nLast year, customers started requesting hot food that they could take to go. The couple invested in the build out of a small kitchen in the back of the store.

She has two children who still live at home, and she lives with her long-term partner, who is the children's father. Reina\u2019s most important challenge is to live according to God\u2019s will.\r\n\r\nReina is requesting her tenth loan from Esperanza International. Because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the re-investment from each loan. She has had the opportunity to improve her life and family and expand her business to get more clients. Reina would like to save her profits to renovate her house and give her children a safer home. In the future, she wants to become a successful and professional businesswoman.

This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community and the store is connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, an egg, and other things. She gets her product from a wholesaler at a lower price then she sells it per piece for a higher price to have profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby, and the people in the community. She earns 300 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. This loan will be a great help for her to add more products to her store.\r\n\r\nBelinda hopes that her business will continue to grow and she is hoping to help her parents and give her children a good education and life. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She started her business with the first loan she received from Esperanza International almost five years ago. She plans to use this loan to purchase different pairs of shoes, for men, women and kids. She has been selling shoes from the beginning and now she is planning to add clothes, underwear and other products. She hopes to increase her inventory with her business profits. She also hopes to save some of the profits because her future plan is to improve her family's living conditions, have enough money to provide a good education for her children, and send the children to university.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to be able to save enough money to continue improving her family's lives and to make one of her dreams come true, the dream of having a successful business.

She sells edible products such as rice, milk, pasta, and vegetables from her stall located in the local market. Previously, she worked in the fields harvesting organic cocoa. However, she felt that she was not able to spend enough time with her daughters, so she decided to take over a stall that her cousin gave her.\r\nShe started off with just a few products because she did not have enough working capital.

Now her son is rendering taxi service day and night, contributing to the family income. Her husband has retired from work and now stays at home. The house they live in loses its heat greatly during winter time and the family uses lots of coal for heating. So she is requesting a loan of 3,500,000 Tugriks (MNT) to purchase a low pressure furnace. Using this item, her family will reduce their coal consumption thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by releasing fewer pollutants into the air.

The loan will be used to buy more clothes to sell and will help Annet to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She has an adobe house where she lives with her six children thus forming a big family.  \r\n\r\nAntonia owns farmland outside the location where she lives where she grows organic cocoa beans.  She started in this business more than 20 years ago because agriculture was her only option for earning money to support her family.  Since she\u2019d grown up in the countryside she\u2019d learned what was necessary to grow quality fruit using organic manure and providing adequate care to her crops.  \r\n\r\nPart of the land she grows on was passed down to her by her parents and as time passed she\u2019s managed to enlarge it by buying neighboring parcels.  Having more land to cultivate means she needs more money too to buy cocoa bean plants and others which she was able to do using her savings.  She comments that it\u2019s always necessary to have money to cover other needs like weed removal and gathering the beans for which she must hire local laborers.  \r\n\r\nIn future, she\u2019d like to acquire a vehicle to transport her products from her farmland to her place of residence because private transportation providers charge very high prices for transportation services.  Another of her objectives is to make home improvements; she wants to build it with adobe.  \r\n\r\nThis is her third Kiva loan which is the reason why she\u2019s grateful for the opportunity she\u2019s being given to reach her work goals.

Her parents taught her to cultivate profitable local products, such as organic cocoa and coffee, when she was a child. When she turned 20, her parents gave her a small plot of land so that she could work independently.\r\nWith the passing of time, she used her income to progressively expand her agricultural land in order to increase her income.

in the countryside, the son of an agronomist.  His father used to work as an agronomist at a local kolkhoz (collective farm), and his mother also worked there as a farmer.  His parents used to work in the fields from morning until the evening, seven days a week.  As a child, Qahramon saw all that, and dreamed about working on a farm one day, like his father, because even though the family was poor and faced financial hardship, they were also happy. \r\n\r\nQahramon is now married and he has two children.  For the past four years he has been involved in raising cattle and smaller livestock.  In addition to this activity, he also works on a farm.  His wife helps him by producing and selling her own dairy products at home.\r\n\r\nWith a growing family and more needs to meet, Qahramon would like to increase his business.  This is why he has turned to MDO Arvand to purchase an additional dairy cow."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":313.71,"image":{"id":1349691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is well known in her region with the good quality of products she sells, in addition to the special competitive prices she sets. She hopes to keep increasing her production and expanding her work to open a wide shop in the future.\r\n\r\nAmal is pictured on the far right.\r\n\r\nSamira is the second from the left.

She has one jeepney unit (14-16 person capacity), for which she charges boundary (a fixed amount of money) each day. Her regular passengers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will use the loan to pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit and to buy spare parts. She expects a boost in her business income, as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to have more jeepneys, and dreams of living happily.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Adolfo studies in his town's technical school, is single and has a business selling perfumes. He sells them in his school, to his classmates and teachers; He says that he began this business to help his mother pay for a portion of his studies. Since the school asks him for a lot of work and material, this would help his mother. \r\n\r\nHe says it is going well for him because his clients already put in orders with him and this motivates him to move forward. He goes and buys them in Mexico City in different stores where they give him lower prices so that he is able to make some profit. He says that some of them are sent to him by his relatives in the United States because they are sold at slightly lower prices there, and that gives him another advantage. He sells his perfumes in cash or in payments so that it's not too hard for his clients and that way his perfumes don't lose their appeal.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan in order to stock up on men's and women's perfumes since he has various pending orders, and with what he makes from his sales he will be able to help with school expenses.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are named Silvia, Leshlye, Estela, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Nora Ang\u00e9lica, Reyna and Josefina.

He is very well-known in his community, which is located in the hills far from the city. For years, he worked alongside his father on the farm and in the blacksmith shop (making curved knives, machetes, and bars, among others). He started making these tools, which farmers use to work the land, at the age of 14. At the beginning, they worked along with three other people; now there are two. He also works in agriculture, farming 10,500 square meters of corn. At the age of 19, Fausto emigrated to the United States to work in construction. He returned to his country at the age of 23. Later, he once again moved abroad and returned when he was 27. By then, he had already bought a plot of land and built his house.\r\n\r\nHe wakes up at 3:00 a.m. to make sixteen curved knives before 9:00 a.m. Afterwards, he moves to the farm where he plants his crops in order to prepare the land. He buys iron and coal, the raw materials with which he makes knives and machetes, every 22 days in town, depending on the demand. He pays for transport to make these purchases. The process is the same when he buys farm supplies.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy fertilizer and to pay for workers to clear the land where he will cultivate 10,500 meters of corn. He will use the rest to buy iron and coal to make curved knives and machetes, because they are currently in great demand. With this investment, he will be able to obtain a good harvest which will help him to feed his family. By making more curved knives and machetes, he will receive greater earnings. He sells them in his house, and he sometimes goes out to make sales in the town plaza. He would like to improve his home and give his children an education, because he only studied up until the fifth grade."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1354605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

is 51 years-old. He lives in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, with his 40 year-old wife Khatuna. Aleksandre has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start up a family business but without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nKhatuna is a dance teacher. She owns a small dance studio and earns a small monthly income which is the only source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nAleksandre requested a loan from Kiva partner Credo in order to start-up a family business. Aleksandre has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high risk borrowers because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan Aleksandre will purchase a car to drive as a taxi. He will serve the locals by providing transport and will earn a small daily income for the family. Aleksandre is a very hard working man and he will work long hours to earn a good profit. The increased income will give him an opportunity to improve the family standard of living.

This type of activity helps her earning an income to economically support her household as much as she can, as she is single and she has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about what she likes of Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the loan, the seminars and the health program.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5775,"image":{"id":1353725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-05-21T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-20T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":5775,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Maribel\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":40101.53,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2632.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3406.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3404.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.55},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":869.73,"local_amount":6039.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6051.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809288,"comment":null},{"amount":981.1,"local_amount":6812.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":6826.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669358,"comment":null},{"amount":981.1,"local_amount":6812.76,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6826.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915117,"comment":null},{"amount":1471.65,"local_amount":10219.14,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":10239.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197748,"comment":null},{"amount":1471.42,"local_amount":10217.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10237.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153495,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T21:21:14Z","paid_date":"2013-11-18T11:17:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":561992,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lourdes, de 31 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora.

She lives with three of her four children in the house she bought two years ago. She makes a living selling groceries. She opens the doors of her store in the morning to serve the area's inhabitants. She closes the store after a few hours and goes out to the fields to sell mainly soft drinks and juice. \"It is a stable source of income for me, because I found a way to continue making sales. After 8 in the morning, the people in my town go out to work on their crops and they are not at home. Therefore, I am taking advantage of this opportunity to keep selling,\" she says. \r\n\r\nShe would now like to increase her working capital in order to sell a larger variety of products. This is her second Kiva loan. She is grateful for the financial support she has received, because it allows her to continue moving forward. She is also committed to paying her installments on time.
