But in order to feed her family, one salary of a teacher is not enough.  This is why Khursheda is additionally involved in her own business - she raises and sells livestock.  She has been working with Arvand since 2009.  She started her business with the first loan by purchasing livestock to raise.  At the present time, her income increased a lot and she is able to cover all of the family expenses.  Today she has 2 cows, 2 calves, one bull and 20 heads of sheep.  Khursheda says that once she started working with Arvand, her life changed for the better and she is grateful to Arvand for the financial support.  Now Khursheda wants to increase her income, and this is why she came to Arvand to obtain a loan to buy livestock.

She got involved in this field thanks to a friend who taught her and helped her to find jobs with various companies. Throughout the years, Alba gained experience and knowledge, and she was also able to save money, which she eventually used to buy the first sewing machines to open her own tailoring workshop.\r\n\r\nToday, Alba has her own clients, she increased her working capital, and she has the support of two employees that she hired. They all work together from 7:00 am until 8:00 pm, manufacturing sportswear. This is how Alba is able to generate the necessary income to cover the family expenses (her family consists of her husband and their two children).\r\n\r\nAlba is known for being a very charismatic person, energetic and hardworking; she is always searching for alternatives to get her business ahead. For this reason, she is now requesting this loan, to invest in buying an industrial sewing machine and sewing patterns, which would make manufacturing more efficient by reducing production time and ensuring timely delivery of orders to her customers.\r\n\r\nAll this would contribute towards increasing her income, which in turn would allow her to accept additional orders and continue to expand her business. Alba wishes to purchase more equipment in order to offer more employment opportunities, improving not only the quality of life for her family, but also for other people involved in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.99,"image":{"id":1454691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an industrial sewing machine and sewing patterns.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caldas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T17:30:07Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Luc\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89671},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92156},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94710},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97334},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100031},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":102803},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":105652},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108579},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111588},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":114680},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":117858},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121124},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124480},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":127929},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":131474},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":135117},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":138862},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":142709},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146664},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150728},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154905},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159197},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163608},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":168141}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.06},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.61},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.81,"local_amount":95272,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":95804.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095681,"comment":null},{"amount":46.59,"local_amount":87364,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074740,"comment":null},{"amount":50.59,"local_amount":94860,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":95390.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T15:53:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619857,"name":"Viet's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Viet was born in 1986; he has a child who is little, and his wife is a worker who earns about 3,000,000 VND. \r\n\r\nViet has been a taxi driver for three years, and he earns about 3,000,000 VND per month.

He is married and has two children.  He has a very friendly family.  They live in a rural area.  He tries to earn money somehow in order to provide income for the family.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has carried out this work over the years to support her family. Every day she goes to the fields very early, where she begins maintenance tasks with the aim of obtaining a good yield at the end. \r\n\r\nShe began very young as she needed to support her children and offer them a good quality of life, attempting to school full time in the hope that they will become better people. She began working with the help of labourers for various tasks that she thought were complicated like pulling up the weeds. She has been lucky to rely on land that maintains her organic coffee and mullein in a good state so she manages to obtain reasonable harvests. One of her main objectives is to obtain better harvests supported with organic manure. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Kiva and she is grateful for the financial support that she is receiving to continue improving, as well as committing to making her repayments. She hopes on this opportunity to receive 2000 PEN and invest it in buying organic manure and cocoa plants in order to continue with her current productive season."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.83,"image":{"id":1454718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic manure and cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":221.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":233.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":228.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":248.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":247.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":271.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":269.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":279.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.23,"local_amount":221.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":221.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905792,"comment":null},{"amount":84.6,"local_amount":233.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":233.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T22:03:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619870,"name":"Thuy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thuy was born in 1982.

She is married and her husband works for a government institution as he is an agriculturist. They have three daughters who are studying at university.\r\n\r\nShe has a new American clothing retail business and has been working at market for 2 years. Previously, she sold products from a catalogue. She learnt the clothing sales business from her cousin her rented her a stall in the market and this was how she decided to start in this business. The market is a 15 minute walk from her home. She works alone as her daughters are studying and her husband works so they do not have time to help her.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more clothing for men and children as she is lacking these and they are want her customers ask for the most, but also to display they at her market stall as two months ago they ran out of stock and have had to be ordered individually.

She is married to Paulino, with whom she had 4 children, all of which are older and independent.\r\n\r\nEpifania has a home of adobe where she lives only with her husband. She works in agriculture, and she plants products like cacoa, coffee, and barbasco [an inedible yam used in making synthetic hormones] among others. She has been doing this work for 35 years, and from the beginning, it has been her principle economic foundation, with which she managed to support her children economically. \r\n\r\nWhen Epifania started to develop this trade, she says that these crops were not in demand because they were located in the jungle, neglected by capital investments. However, with the passage of time, support from the state, and private companies, she has managed to increase her earnings like other farmers in the area, with the income from direct buyers and entitites that deal wholly with the capture of the region's net products.\r\n\r\nEpifania is pleased with her work, which she has done almost all her life, trying to obtain good quality products each season. One of her main objectives is to manage to construct her home with superior materials, which she hopes to leave as a legacy for her children in the benefit of her grandchildren who she loves very much. \r\n\r\nThis Epifania's second loan with Kiva, and she is very grateful for the financial support that she receives to keep going forward, and further, she promises to pay her dues on time. This time she hopes to have 2,000 nuevos soles to purchase wholesale organic fertilizer and sacks to store the cacao beans. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":164.83,"image":{"id":1454726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase organic fertilizer and sacks for storing cacao. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":221.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":233.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":228.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":248.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":247.78},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":271.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":269.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":279.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.23},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.6},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.23,"local_amount":221.32,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":221.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905795,"comment":null},{"amount":84.6,"local_amount":233.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":233.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091794,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T03:26:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619839,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a married youth client from Iraq.

Her main job has to do with agriculture and selling  cocoa beans produced in a land of 3 hectares.\r\n\r\nIt started when she was 18-years-old and did not have a stable job.  It was right after having her first child that she began to devote fully to her current job having strong support from her ex-husband.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the job, she needed money to buy fertilizer, tools, and money to pay the workers that were hired to set up the first cocoa plantations, managing to receive support from her parents to pay for various expenses. To get  high quality cocoa beans, she must perform routine maintenance tasks such as removing badly cut stalks and weeds.

Occasionally she also works on other small fabric items for the household, such as pillow cases and decorative rugs.\r\n\r\nShe would like to buy a new sewing machine and a small generator, both of which would allow her to work better, faster, and in a more organized fashion. Being able to work exactly when she would like to -- and not just when the government provides power -- will greatly improve her work conditions. To be able to afford the purchases, she is taking a small loan from Relief International Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

He is married and has a child.  He lives with his family in a small village.  For now, they have to live in their parents' home.  Sherafkan wants, very much, to build a house for his own family.  Sherafkan's wife is a hardworking homemaker and a caring mother.  Sherafkan works as a carpenter.  This job provides a good income, however, it is not enough to cover extra expenses, such as building a new house.  This income is only enough to pay for the food expenses.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of his brothers, who work in Russia, Sherafkan was able to purchase a plot of land.  Now, he needs the financial means to buy all of the necessary building materials to build a house.  This is the reason why Sherafkan applied to Arvand for a loan to purchase building materials.  Sherafkan is hoping for a successful outcome and thanks Arvand, in advance, for their support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1451226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials to build his house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T01:20:05Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sherafkan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":342},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":353.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":366.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":379.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":392.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":406.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":420.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":435.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":450.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":466.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":482.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":505.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.31},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619972,"name":"Genya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genya is 56 years old and she lives in the village of Khashtarak which is in Tavush region.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like James who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":169.3,"image":{"id":1451375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more items for his shop to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nakaloke","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":110.86,"local_amount":277140,"processed_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":281717.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470750,"comment":null},{"amount":58.44,"local_amount":146122,"processed_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148535.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440156195,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-20T23:53:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619977,"name":"Maitta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maitta lives and works in New-Kru-Town of Liberia, which is poor in living conditions.

He raises cattle, however, currently, he has only a few in number.  Hasanboi wants to increase their number.  He plans to use the winter to fatten them and then sell them by the springtime, but he does not have the financial means to do so.  This is the reason why he is applying for a loan.  Hasanboi is planning to use this loan to purchase a few additional cattle and to increase his herd.  In Hasanboi's words, he trusts Arvand and is hoping to receive support of this organization."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.56,"image":{"id":1451297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hasanboi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":153.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":158.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":163.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":169.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":175.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":180.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":187.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":193.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":206.81},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":211.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.51},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.56,"local_amount":153.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":155.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-30T17:52:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622285,"name":"Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nCruz de 41 a\u00f1os de edad habita junto a su grupo familiar en casa de su propiedad desde hace 35 a\u00f1os de edad.

Interestingly, it contains one of the biggest markets in Liberia, which leads to the reduced price of food.\r\n \r\nRenale is married with three children between 11 and 18 years, who are in school and live at home. Over the past eight years, she has been operating a table business; she started this business with money from her mother, and learned this way of selling from her. She is requesting a loan to purchase more sugar, garlic, rice, butter, etc. for her business. Her plan is to move from the table business to shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":64.93,"image":{"id":1451443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to

The couple have children, who are studying and living at home.\r\n\r\nSilveria makes a living with a small chicken farm.  She has been doing this work for ten years, having started with a small project which was launched in the community.  When the project finished, she took out a loan in order to continue working.  Silveria has the chicken farm at her home and all the family helps with it, as much care is required with the chickens.  Beforehand, Silveria only worked in agriculture but now, while her husband works the land, Silveria looks after the chickens.\r\n\r\nSilveria is applying for a loan from \"Fundaci\u00f3n Campo\" in order to buy more chickens.  Graduation season and Christmas are approaching and at these times demand is high - Silveria needs to be ready.  Silveria will also buy chicken feed to look after the animals.  If Silveria buys in bulk she will save a little as the cost will be lower, and she will only have to make one trip - she must travel 20km to buy the chickens, and must pay for a taxi, as there is no public transport.\r\n\r\nIn the future Silveria would like to expand her farm and to work harder in order for her family to earn high profits.  She wants to see her children become professionals and very successful, and respected in the community.  Silveria also wants her children to learn to work so that, when they grow up, they can work in the community and earn a good life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.19,"image":{"id":1454944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more chickens and chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silveria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":30.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":38.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":39.61},{"due_date":"2015-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2015-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.18},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.02,"local_amount":29.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":29.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505309,"comment":null},{"amount":23.17,"local_amount":23.17,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":23.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T12:45:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622397,"name":"Elia Hermenegilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elia de 59 a\u00f1os,  estudio hasta 6\u00ba grado, es madre soltera, tiene un hijo de 17 a\u00f1os  que vive con ella, estudia 3\u00ba a\u00f1o de bachillerato, en su casa vive su hijo y un hermano de ella. \n\nElla ha instalado una tienda, su horario de trabajo es de las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta la 5 de la tarde. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que est\u00e1 solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para surtir m\u00e1s la tienda con productos (granos b\u00e1sicos, ropa, churros, golosinas etc.) con el cr\u00e9dito podr\u00e1  comprar y vender m\u00e1s,  aumentando sus  ingresos.\n\nEn el futuro piensa, surtir mucha m\u00e1s su tienda,  hacerla m\u00e1s grande y por medio del negocio darle el estudio y la educaci\u00f3n adecuada a mi hijo para que pueda estudiar en la universidad y llegar hacer un profesional.\n\n","en":"Elia is 59 years old and completed up to sixth grade at school.

His goal is for his children to study in a good school and for his business to grow so his family can get ahead."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":56.86,"image":{"id":1454992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, beans, lard, cleaning products, soft drinks and snacks to stock his grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Nueva Frontera, Santa Barbara.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T17:40:07Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Te\u00f3filo        ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":507.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":630},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":652.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":674.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":698.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":722.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":748.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":774.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":801.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":829.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":858.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":919.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":951.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":985.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1019.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1055.48},{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1280.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.73},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.07},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.77},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.36,"local_amount":507.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":518.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430129893,"comment":null},{"amount":31.5,"local_amount":630,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":644.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439829715,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T14:18:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620248,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac has a butchery business in Naivasha and has been in this business for 7 years.

She is married and has two children.  She lives with her family in a small village.  She and her husband try to work a lot in order to provide their children with everything necessary.  Jamila is involved in buying and selling dairy products at a local market.  Her husband and youngest son work as carpenters.  Now Jamila is planning to marry off her son and is preparing everything necessary for this event.  She is buying various things, consumer electronics, furniture and the like for young people.
