She lives with her two daughters in an adobe house and produces organic cacao and achiote (a spice).  She has been supporting her parents with small tasks since she was a little girl, the farm being the family\u2019s main source of support.  Having been elderly when she got engaged to Edilberto, who inherited some parcels of land from her parents, she began a life full of goals, such as buying an additional parcel of land as an additional product of her first years\u2019 of work with her husband.  She wants to produce optimum cacao to sell but needs working capital to hire field hands and buy compost.\r\n\r\nOne of her greatest challenges is the constant attack from regional plagues that occasionally cause considerable damage to her crops, which she fights with natural repellants.  This will be her first loan through Kiva.  She is grateful for the opportunity and is committed to making her payments on time.  She will use the 3,000 PEN to make improvements to her home, beginning with the plumbing, drainage, and improvements to her corrugated roof.  The aim is to improve her family life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1339493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to make home improvements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":329.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":329.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":362.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":374.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":373.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":398.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":411.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.43,"local_amount":329.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-22T08:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":329.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530470,"comment":null},{"amount":126.13,"local_amount":329.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":329.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975496,"comment":null},{"amount":138.88,"local_amount":362.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":362.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996765,"comment":null},{"amount":143.44,"local_amount":374.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":374.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864239,"comment":null},{"amount":143,"local_amount":373.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":373.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352610,"comment":null},{"amount":152.87,"local_amount":398.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":398.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904378,"comment":null},{"amount":157.9,"local_amount":411.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":411.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090461,"comment":null},{"amount":161.35,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":420.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777250,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-25T23:18:42Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":553057,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Lucio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 de cuarenta y ocho a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida en casa propia, \u00e9l se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz, tiene varios a\u00f1os de trabajar en la agricultura y se ha hecho de mucha experiencia que le permite obtener las mejores cosechas; comercializa sus cosechas en los mercados de granos basicos cerca de su lugar de residencia.

Se cas\u00f3 con Jos\u00e9 que es un chofer profesional de 48 a\u00f1os y con quien tuvo un hijo nombrado como su padre y que es un adolescente de 17 a\u00f1os a quien esperan un d\u00eda poder verlo recibir su t\u00edtulo profesional. Gloria vive con su familia en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, tras recorrer polvorientos caminos y respirar el aire puro del campo, Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana y que conserva rec\u00f3nditas historias del antepasado de la cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por los negocios que ofertan deportes extremos que a simple vista se puede ver que son manufacturados con mucha seguridad e ingenio. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, pues hasta hace poco, muchos no gozaban el beneficio de tener agua potable o luz el\u00e9ctrica.\nGloria se dedica a brindar servicio de transporte en su cant\u00f3n desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, lo hizo con el prop\u00f3sito de mejorar la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en su hogar y juntamente con su esposo aportar a los gastos de educaci\u00f3n, salud, vivienda y alimentaci\u00f3n. Ella aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad desde muy joven cuando acompa\u00f1aba a su padre a transportar las frutas que cosechaban en su peque\u00f1a finca hacia el mercado central del pueblo. Gloria no tiene un horario fijo, pues hay temporadas en donde la visita de turistas es grande e incluso le piden hacer recorridos que le llevan todo el d\u00eda. Un de las tareas m\u00e1s complicadas en su trabajo es el conducir por las noches y en lluvia, pues en repetidas ocasiones las carreteras han sufrido da\u00f1os que no permiten el paso de ning\u00fan veh\u00edculo. El sue\u00f1o de Gloria es un d\u00eda poder comprar una finca para dedicarse de lleno al cultivo y comercializaci\u00f3n de productos agr\u00edcolas, pero mientras eso se cumple seguir\u00e1 esforz\u00e1ndose por hacer un trabajo responsable en su veh\u00edculo el cual debe pasar por mantenimientos exhaustivos peri\u00f3dicos para poder ser matriculado y seguir legalmente considerado como un transporte p\u00fablico por las autoridades competentes, para lo cual Gloria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo usar\u00e1 para este mantenimiento y tr\u00e1mites correspondientes para tener en regla el funcionamiento de su camioneta que d\u00eda a d\u00eda transporta pasajeros inclusive fuera del cant\u00f3n. Gloria tuvo la oportunidad de conocer a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le brindaron seguridad y confianza para poder realizar este pr\u00e9stamo, adem\u00e1s la asesor\u00eda que recibe le servir\u00e1 de mucho para administrar los recursos que mantiene hasta el momento y los que recibe como utilidad en su negocio. Esta mujer emprendedora motiva a quienes alrededor del mundo visitan el sitio web de Kiva para que sigan apoyando a tanta gente que necesita el apoyo para salir adelante. ","en":"Gloria, 44, was unable to continue with her schooling after completing elementary school due to her family\u2019s scarce economic resources.  She married Jos\u00e9, 48, who is a professional driver with whom she had a son who is named after his father and who is a 17-year-old adolescent who they hope someday receives his professional degree.\r\n\r\nGloria lives with her family in a rural parish in the city of Quito, capital of Ecuador Province.  Nanegalito is a parish located in northwest Pichincha Province that after traveling dusty roads leads to the pure air in the countryside.  It was home to an Ecuadoran culture which still maintains arcane ancestral stories from the Ecuadoran past.  It\u2019s a place with diverse flora and fauna as well as rivers and waterfalls that are a source of crystalline water that attracts national and foreign tourists because of the extreme sports offered that are clearly designed with safety and ingenuity.  Another source of production in the area is cattle and milk as well as meat production.   In agriculture, sugarcane, manioc, corn, oranges, mandarins and papayas stand out.  Hand-made crafts are also a business opportunity in the zone; they are in demand because of the natural materials like forest seeds that are used to make them.  Because of all this, the local authorities have focused on providing adequate installations so that all of the more than 3,000 inhabitants can have access to basic utilities despite the fact that this zone in the past had been neglected; up to fairly recently they did not enjoy the benefits of potable water or electricity.\r\n\r\nGloria has worked for the last ten years providing transportation services in her canton.  She did so aiming at improving her home\u2019s economic situation and helps her husband with education, health, and housing and food costs.  She learned this activity while very young when she\u2019d accompany her father transporting fruit they grew on their small farm to the city central market.\r\n\r\nGloria does not have a fixed work schedule because there are high tourism seasons and sometimes some of her routes are day-long.  One of the most complicated chores she has at work is having to drive at night and in the rain because highways are often damaged preventing all vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s dream is to be able someday to buy a farm to work full-time in agriculture and selling farm products but until that dream is a reality she will continue striving to work responsibly with her vehicle which must be given periodic exhaustive service and maintenance in order to be licensed and be allowed by local authorities to continue to be used for public transportation.  This is why Gloria is asking for a loan she\u2019ll use to service the vehicle and pay for the corresponding paperwork to have her vehicle she uses daily to transport passengers even beyond the canton in operating conditions.\r\n\r\nGloria learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who offered her security and trust to carry out this loan; she also got advice that will be very useful for her to manage the resources that she still retains and receives as profits in her business.  This enterprising woman motivates those who around the world visit the Kiva site so that they will continue supporting so many people who need support in order to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800.44,"image":{"id":1339544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to service her vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-04-25T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-25T19:50:04Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1605.75,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":79.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":101.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":103.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":107.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":109.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":111.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":114.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":118.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":120.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.54},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.54,"local_amount":79.59,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133258,"comment":null},{"amount":96.6,"local_amount":95.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313797,"comment":null},{"amount":199.89,"local_amount":197.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":199.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565402,"comment":null},{"amount":102.44,"local_amount":101.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":102.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320613,"comment":null},{"amount":105.2,"local_amount":103.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856303,"comment":null},{"amount":106.54,"local_amount":105.28,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":106.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059878,"comment":null},{"amount":109.23,"local_amount":107.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995221,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T01:32:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":553063,"name":"Banco Mujer Aracolpa Ka\u00f1eblocke A\u00f1ita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Banco Mujer Aracolpa Ka\u00f1eblocke A\u00f1ita, significa es un dialecto Ind\u00edgena Mujeres Trabajando Unidas, es el nombre de este grupo de mujeres ind\u00edgenas que cuenta con una amplia trayectoria con Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer.

The group was formed in 2006 and to date has been granted four loans. The group is made up of eight members, all of whom work in agriculture. The women also belong to their community's Indigenous Woman's Association and through these organizations fight for better living conditions. \r\n  \r\nThe leader of the group is 44-year-old Rafaela who has been married for over 25 years and who due to health problems could never have children. Her husband works as a security officer. Rafaela has always worked in the field; it is what she enjoys doing, and today she grows plantains and bananas. Rafaela will invest this new loan in supplies such as seeds, compost, fertilizer, insecticides, plastic bags and cardboard boxes, among others. This is her way of helping her husband with the household expenses as the income he earns is very little. The previous loans allowed Rafaela to begin planting her crops as well as to grow over the years until she obtained a quality product.\r\n \r\nRafaela's goals are to increase the area of her crop and to ensure she has a small fund for her retirement.

For the past year, Esther has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells rice, juice, cooking oil and beans. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Esther has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more maize flour, rice, cooking oil and juice to sell in the store, and will help Esther to generate greater profits and help her family in buying basic needs. Esther hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her store into a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nEsther is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to buy different types of clothes to sell, and will help Zuena to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her young siblings. Zuena hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nZuena is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known from their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She previously used a 24,000 PHP loan to purchase more quantities and varieties of grocery items and products needed in her business.  Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and for expenditures (personal, household, and business). \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory.  The more items displayed in her store the better, as more items will result in better profit.  Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses.  She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams to have a grocery store and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

The more items displayed at the store the better, as this will result in more profit.  Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs.  She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nAlma hopes for continued success in her business.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, to build social capital, and to pay microfinance loans.

is Carmelita, 50, resident of Batasan, Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Danilo and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. They are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nCarmelita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCarmelita hopes that her business will grow bigger. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week. This is where she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1337381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

city of Kapan.  Loreta is married and has two daughters.  Loreta's younger daughter is married and lives separately from her parents.  Loreta's husband is a construction worker and is away in Russia earning money.\r\n\r\nLoreta has been selling clothing since 2009.  Right now Loreta rents a stall at the market in her native city of Kapan and sells clothing that she brings monthly from the wholesale markets in Yerevan and neighboring countries.  Her older daughter, who is a financial analyst helps her with her business.  After many years of selling clothing Loreta has a lot of regular customers who prefer to buy clothing and shoes for their families from Loreta's store.  In small cities like Kapan it is very difficult for women to find job and to take care of their families and Loreta is very happy that she can handle these difficulties on her own, but as she admitted without her husband's help, who works abroad, she would not have been able to manage.  \r\n\r\nKapan is one of the southernmost cities in Armenia and there is almost no spring there, starting in April it is already summer weather there and this is why Loreta decided to purchase a large lot of clothing from Yerevan a little bit earlier.  Loreta is asking Kiva lenders for a loan of 2,400 US dollars for the purchase of women's, men's and children's clothing, sleeping attire and shoes for resale in Kapan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":507,"image":{"id":1337981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His wife also specialized in architecture and now performs interior work on contract with building companies. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has been deteriorating over the years and needs some serious repair. He is requesting a loan of 5,000,000 MNT (Mongolian tugriks) to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, planks, iron, fiberglass, foams, gypsum and dry boards. Using those materials, he can repair and insulate his house, and the renovated house will enable the family to live in a comfortable and warm place. More importantly, the family will reduce its coal usage, release less smoke and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

is 41 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. He is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past five years, Jackson has been working hard to manage his small clothing business, in which he sells clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jackson has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

She is married to Manuel, who has a job, and they have two children.  They live together in their own house.  Irma has a business selling meals at the weekend.  She has a small space on the pavement outside her home for her business and it is there that she sells typical, regional dishes such as \"juanes\" (a rice and meat dish), fried chicken and roast meats.  Irma always offers friendly and polite service to her customers.  She starts very early when she goes out to buy her ingredients for the dishes she will be selling each day.  She has had the business for 16 years and receives support from her daughter and daughter-in-law to attend to customers.  Irma likes her business as it has brought her a lot of financial and personal satisfaction.  She says that the work does not require much physical effort and so she is able to move forward in life.  Irma would like her work to remain stable so that she may continue to work.

is 48 years old.

Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. Nina is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, she has 1.25 hectares of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown seasonally. It provides barely enough food for the family. According to Credo's assessment, the family belongs in the \"subsistence poor\" category. Nina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. The client received the first part (tranche) of the start-up loan, which will be used to buy green bean, tomato and cabbage seeds. Within 30 days after loan disbursement, Credo will monitor the client and, if the loan purpose has been met, will disburse the second tranche, which will be used to hire agricultural workers to help Nina in developing her farming business. After buying the seeds, she will be able to sow them and have a harvest in a few months. The products she harvests will be sold at local markets, and Nina will increase her income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of her family.

He lives in Kianeti village, Bolnisi District with his 59-year-old wife Nanuli.  Tamaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they own a plot of land and a vineyard. Tamaz cultivates the land and plants different kinds of fruit and vegetables. Harvested grapes are used to make vodka and wine. They are sold with the harvested fruits and vegetables at the local markets. The family also has a pig and four piglets. Nanuli is looking after them. Later when piglets are grown they will be sold as meat.\r\n\r\nTamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tamaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Tamaz will purchase two milk cows. They will be milking the cows every day and making dairy products. The products will be sold at the local markets and among the villagers so the family will be able to earn a good profit. Part of the profit will be used for reinvesting in the same field, in order to expand their agricultural business and another part for covering their monthly expenses. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":773.25,"image":{"id":1337532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase two milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kianeti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamaz ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.01},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.95},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":154.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":158.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":176.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":181.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":187.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":191.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.71},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":89.43,"local_amount":146.01,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969192,"comment":null},{"amount":89.71,"local_amount":146.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":148.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749612,"comment":null},{"amount":93.07,"local_amount":151.95,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":154.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613518,"comment":null},{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":154.58,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":156.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857235,"comment":null},{"amount":97.26,"local_amount":158.78,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":160.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133889,"comment":null},{"amount":100.56,"local_amount":164.19,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":166.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107476,"comment":null},{"amount":102.63,"local_amount":167.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":169.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255024,"comment":null},{"amount":105.91,"local_amount":172.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":175.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019174,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-28T13:19:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551643,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This marks Susan's third loan.

This is Ernestinas story:\n\nErnestina is 44 years old and lives in Paso del R\u00edo, in the state of Veracruz, with her beloved husband and her two parents. During her childhood, Ernestina was in charge of the household tasks. As a teenager she worked cooking and helping with the home activities of her neighbors, so she could contribute to her own household expenses.  Ernestina\u00b4s household has no access to the electric grid and that is why she must do her household tasks whilst there is still daylight. During the night she uses candles to do other activities. \n\nFor 20 years Ernestina has been devoted to the caring of one single household along with her husband. Her husband whose job as a fisherman provides the only family income, however, his salary is not stable because it depends on market demand.\n\nErnestina wants to contribute to her household expenses and work as hard as her husband by cooking food and selling it to other fishermen. To achieve this, Ernestina wishes to buy a solar home system that will bring lighting to her home and will allow her to extend productivity hours every day, so she will be able to help her household tasks during the day and cook at night, additionally, this will allow her to spend time with her loving family. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1337915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase a solar home system that provides lighting for their homes.

Since he became a father 10 years ago, Mart\u00edn works even harder to bring a better life quality to his wife and two children. His job as a peasant allows him to earn $228 USD a month, which he distributes to the maintenance of his home, the care of his family and the education of his children, whom he has taught to love agriculture but also to work on their school tasks. \n\nMart\u00edn\u00b4s home does not have grid access, however he has tried to improve this situation by lighting their home with candles, but the bad light quality cannot allow their children to extend their education hours and exposes them to breathing hazardous smoke.

"texts":{"en":"This is Analiza, 33, resident of Malibay, Pasay, Philippines. She is married to Limo and a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnaliza runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Analiza's case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in poor urban communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in a public market in a poor, urban area, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can reinvest the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nAnaliza dreams that her business will continue to grow. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1337582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for additional stock of quality used clothes needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":686.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364489198,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894823,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669863,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534396,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":686.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399783803,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-26T18:42:33Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554020,"name":"Rhuhekekuguma Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Nzige est pr\u00e9sidente du groupe de cr\u00e9dit Rhuhekekuguma, entrepreneur dynamique, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 34 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 8 enfants.

is 55 years old and lives in the New Kru Town area of Montserrado County. He is married. He was unfortunate to have attended only grade school, but he learned other trades by which he is surviving. His wife is a business woman and they have four children between the ages of 2 and 28, who are presently attending school. Two attend university while the younger ones attend grade school.\r\n\r\nFor the past 20 years, Mohammed has been running a shop where he fixes and sells items like cooking pots, cooking spoons, frying pans, etc. He makes a lot of profit since he is the only one who is involved in this business in his area.

","en":"Abdusalim is a kind, 60 year-old man.  He is married and has two adult children.  Abdusalim's children and their families live in their house in a small village, and this is why it can be said that they have a big and friendly family.  All of them try to work together to earn income for their big family.  Abdusalim's wife works at a dekhan farm, and the oldest son works as a construction worker in Russia and earns a stable monthly income, which he sends to his family.  Abdusalim is involved in fattening up small livestock.  He has been involved in this type of business since his youth and has an extensive experience in this field.  But also his main profession is driving a truck.  He has been working as a driver for 30 years.  He also earns an additional income working as a truck driver.  Abdusalim dreams that his children and grandchildren lived with plenitude and this is why he works without putting his hands down.  Now he plans to build a house for his oldest son, where he would live with his family.  But this requires a large sum of money, and this is why Abdusalim wants to obtain a loan to buy small livestock in order to expand his business.

His dream was to feed people \u2013 many people.\n\n\"First comes the dream, then the idea,\" he says. \"Then the dream can come true.\"\n\nWaldo opened two businesses: Divine Taste Catering, and restaurant, El Ceviche De Waldito. He says cooking is his calling and he uses his mind, heart and talents to satisfy customers with his authentic Peruvian and Caribbean dishes.\n\nBorn in Peru, Waldo attended a culinary arts school before moving to Miami, where he studied business hospitality before moving to San Antonio.\n\nFollowing his dream, 50-year-old Waldo did everything he could to make the most of his funds. He says when a person has less than $200, \"This is the time you use your brain; this is the time you use your heart and say, 'Yes I can.'\"\n\nWith no vehicle, he and his wife walked to H-E-B, a Texas grocer, for food. They searched trashcans for valuables like chairs and tables they later cleaned and tightened for use in the restaurant.\n\nAfter learning about Accion Texas Inc. at a function for small businesses, Waldo applied and was approved for a loan he's using to build his credit.\n\nExcellent credit history and scores are judgments of a person's future ability to make large purchases, such as when purchasing any type of vehicle or home. If a person has great credit, they seem more likely to repay on-time, and are more likely eligible for a line of credit to make large purchases.\n\nWaldo says, \"When you see the opportunity, don't let it go. It's yours, don't let it go.\"\n\nHe says, \"Accion Texas is like part of the dream come true. I feel covered, I feel like, behind me, there's someone holding my head and my arms named Accion. I don't feel alone.\"\n\nA religious man, Waldo never worried if his business would be successful because he says, \"If one is good in life, they'll be rewarded.\"\n\nAfter two years, he has four employees, four cars and a restaurant where he's served Spanish singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias, President Clinton and Vice President Gore, Mayor Julian, his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a U.S. House Representative, hotel chefs, as well as members of the community.\n\n\"I'm not small. I'm a big guy. Maybe if you see me, I'm a short guy, but I have a big heart,\" he says adding, \"I say, God, thank you for giving me this experience.\"\n\nWhen he can, Waldo says he likes to give back to the community, donating his culinary talents to causes. Now that he has a restaurant, he has new dreams to open a community center, start a scholarship fund for parents who think they are too old to return to school, and fundraise with his food to help pay medical bills for families with cancer-stricken children. But, Waldo says he is taking his dream one step at a time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1327690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to build

of Javalyn\u2019s passions is helping homeless women, especially those recently released from prison in her hometown of Houston. She considered ways to raise funds to help them reconstruct their life upon release. A religious woman, Javalyn says she prayed to God for an answer to help before she decided to open a store and fell in love with retail.\n \nShe opened Javalin\u2019s Boutique on April 8, 2013.  \n \nShe describes it as a \u201cvessel\u201d \u2013 an atmosphere filled with love and community with the goal of becoming a nonprofit that will share its earnings with potential employees. \u201cI\u2019m at the beginning stages of that goal,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m working on registering for 501(c)(3) status.\u201d\n \nThe boutique carries clothing, shoes and accessories and has a home-like feeling. For now, Javalyn only sells women\u2019s apparel, but she plans to expand to include children\u2019s clothing, too.\n \nJavalyn paid out-of-pocket to start her business so she wouldn\u2019t have debt.  But she soon realized she would need financial assistance to grow. While watching TV one night, Javalyn saw a story about a couple who received a loan from Accion Texas to open their business, and decided to reach out to Accion for a loan.  She was approved and used the proceeds to purchase more clothing and accessories to sell in her shop.\n \nShe currently works with her sister, who is volunteering until Javalyn can afford to put her on the payroll. She expects to hire two other employees in the near future.\n \nJavalyn says about Accion: \u201cThey work with you to get a second chance. And who knows, when one door opens, you never know what it\u2019ll do for others. For me, the loan was a lot.\u201d\n \nHer next step is to complete her website: www.javalinsboutique.com.

","en":"Abdumajid is a person with a positive life attitude.  He has a well-developed imagination and knows animal husbandry very well.  Animal husbandry is his primary source of income.  This is why Abdumajid spends the majority of his time being involved in this business.  He takes livestock out to pasture every day.  He cleans the cowshed and maintains control over the cleanliness and health of cows.  Abdumajid specifically prepared a place for cows, where they go to a pasture during the day.  He skillfully transformed a former canal that once had water into a small pasture.  Abdumajid's children are already grown and work on their own.  They help their father and mother financially.  But Abdumajid is not used to sitting put with his hands down.  He has his own livestock, from which he finds his own income.  His wife milks the cow and also earns money selling milk.  Abdumajid wants to take advantage of the season and buy a cow and feed.  He came to MDO Arvand with hope.  He is grateful for the help and trust in providing him with a

He was an apprentice to a master carpenter since childhood and learned all of the nuances of this business.  Gradually, he started working independently.  He took orders at home.  He earned money with his work, helped his parents and got married.  Now Jamshed has his own family, but they live together with his parents.  He has been working at a private company that makes and installs plastic windows for two years.  Today, Jamshed and his family have a need to purchase a car and he wants to buy one, so that his parents and wife had no difficulties with transport.  Currently, Jamshed does not have the required sum of money to buy a car.  He learned from his friends about financing and came to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He hopes for support from Arvand and is grateful in advance for the

lives in Bardnersville, one of the populated areas in Montsorrado county. She is 29 years old and single with three children between the ages of 2 and 8.  All of her children are currently in school and live at home. Christian is a high school dropout, but she is good at managing her business. She says she is a hard-working and respectful person.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Christian has been running a shop where she sells building materials such as nails, cement, paint, paint-brushes, etc. She started this business with a little income from a friend and learned this way of selling from her friends. She says she enjoys her business because it has given her pride and she really enjoys interacting with her customers.

He is married and the father of many children. He has six beautiful children. His two eldest sons are working in Russia, where they repair apartments and get a good income that they send to their parents monthly. The remaining children are still in school. \r\n\r\nBekmirzo and his wife are engaged in their own business in order to have the income to meet family needs. Previously, Bekmirzo worked on a collective farm, but there he received a small salary which was barely enough to live on. As a result, he decided to leave that job and to start his own business. He started growing vegetables and fruits, as well as fattening livestock. He rented a small plot of land and, getting a good harvest each year, increased his income, and soon purchased the land. \r\n\r\nThis year, he planted wheat because it is easier to grow. Bekmirzo's wife helps to care for the crops. But the main activity is of course fattening and selling livestock. This kind of business brings the main income for his family. \r\n\r\nBekmirzo now plans to expand his business and wants to buy livestock for further fattening, and he will graze the livestock on his plot of land. His accumulated funds are not enough for the purchase of livestock, so he wants to get a loan from Arvand and hopes for support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":334.72,"image":{"id":1336001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bekmirzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":765.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":791.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":818.23},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":845.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":874.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":904.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":164.57,"local_amount":765.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":782.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550093,"comment":null},{"amount":170.15,"local_amount":791.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":809.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774318,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-19T00:56:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":553175,"name":"Po Yoayu Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Po Yoayu est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 5to.

Nana is working as an old man\u2019s nurse; her son is working at the local TV station as an operator; and her daughter is working at the local shop as a seller. In addition, Nana\u2019s husband is getting a small monthly pension from government institutions as he is a war veteran. \r\n\r\nNana requested loan from Credo to start up the family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Nana will renovate her house. She will purchase all the needed materials and pay the artisan. After the house is renovated, Nana will rent the rooms out during the summer season. Because Borjomi district is becoming very popular as a tourist area and every summer is very crowded, Nana hopes her business will be profitable. New business will significantly increase the family income, and Nana will be able to provide better living conditions for her family.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is extremely fertile for agriculture.

He has requested a loan of 40,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo, which he will use to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nChristopher was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"Because of farming.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: \"Savings culture.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family,\" Christopher replied, \"It will assist in payment of fees.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Christopher owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own:  'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile.' Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household: 'mosquito net' but does not have: 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD.'\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49.46,"image":{"id":1337693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-04-26T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-26T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":40,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2865.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2940.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3018.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3098.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3180.82},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2207.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2265.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2325.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2386.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2449.82},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2514.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2581.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2649.82},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2719.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2792.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.74},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.73},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.13},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.53,"local_amount":2442.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768832,"comment":null},{"amount":18.93,"local_amount":1514.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1586.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-27T08:53:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":551322,"name":"William Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wiliam es un joven de 22 a\u00f1os de car\u00e1cter alegre y con  muchas ganas de salir adelante.

Robina had a difficult time so she decided to work with her husband to support her family for a better future. She has two children. Fifteen years ago she began making knives with her husband in her house. The man shown in the photo is Robina\u2019s husband. They both make knives in different sizes and sell them to the people of their community in the local market. In this way they make an income to support the entire family.
