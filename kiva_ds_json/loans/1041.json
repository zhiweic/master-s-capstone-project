lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is home to the main campus of Moi University. She has seven children and has been doing this work for eight years.  Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'dairy farming!' Her biggest challenge is 'price fluctuations'. One of the animals on the farm is named 'lelmet.'\r\n\r\nJocelyn was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'fair interest rate.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'saving for the future.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Jocelyn replied 'better quality of life\". She will use the loan of 40,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jocelyn owns the following: 'a cow and poultry' but does not own 'a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle or automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net and TV' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine or a DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1281193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jocelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2876.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.4},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3110.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3192.4},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3276.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3363.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3452.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3543.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3637.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3733.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3831.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.94,"local_amount":2942.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3038.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304970,"comment":null},{"amount":35.87,"local_amount":3020.45,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3118.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355846176,"comment":null},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":3100.29,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3201.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364768557,"comment":null},{"amount":37.79,"local_amount":3182.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3285.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373516625,"comment":null},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":3266.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960227,"comment":null},{"amount":39.81,"local_amount":3352.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3461.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390819933,"comment":null},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":3441.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3553.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417029,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":7157.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":7390.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980569,"comment":null},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":10536.02,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10878.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T08:55:07Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T17:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520042,"name":"Veronico","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past 12 years, Veronico has been selling baked snack food in his local community for a living.

","en":"Mavluda is a very hard-working and driven woman. She is married and has 2 adult children. \r\n\r\nMavluda had a difficult life as a child. From early childhood, she worked as a seamstress: every day after school, she made dresses for other girls and women of her village, in order to earn some money for her family. When she was older, Mavluda moved to the city to go to college, got married, and once again started sewing women's clothing. In order to provide food for their children, her husband became a butcher. \r\n\r\nIn addition to sewing, Mavluda cultivates wheat, corn, peas and other crops. She has been in this business for over 20 years. Her husband, son and daughter-in-law help her with farming. Mavluda sells her harvest directly to the local populace at prices that are lower than those at a market. Most people in the region purchase wheat, process it into flour at a mill, then bake their own bread.\r\n\r\nMavluda would like to increase her income in order to pay for her youngest daughter's education. Mavluda herself dreamed of post-secondary studies, but was unable to pursue them due to family circumstances. This is why she now works hard and tries to provide university education for her children. \r\n\r\nMavluda is planning to launch a new livestock business in order to earn additional income. She has taken the course \"Succeed\", organized by the Association of Business Women, and received her graduation certificate. She is requesting a loan of 15000 somoni to purchase cattle and is counting on your

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Nansana in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is married and has three children who are all currently in school. For the past two years, Damalie has been working hard to manage her general store, a retail shop. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Damalie has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to develop the business and buy more goods such as cooking oil, sodas, and flour, and will help Damalie to generate greater profits and be in position to pay school fees for her children. Damalie hopes that in the future she will be able to have a bigger business. \r\n\r\nDamalie is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

is a 33-year-old married woman from Cortes, Bohol, Philippines. She has four young children ages 12, 11, 7 and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nShe runs a sari-sari or variety store business, selling various goods and commodities to the people in her place. \r\n\r\nAnabel wants to improve her business but lacks the capital to do so.

The loan will be used to purchase more stock of food such as raw matooke (green plantain) to sell. It will help Oliver to generate greater profits and improve her stock. Oliver hopes that in the future she will be able to have a well equipped kiosk. \r\n\r\nOliver is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

from Sierra Leone! This is 38-year-old Ibrahim from Kulanda Town Branch Southern Area Bo District. He is married and has three children between the ages of 2 years and 16 years. Two of his children attend school. \r\n\r\nIbrahim runs a shoe store where he sells ladies' sandal, shoes, children's slippers, etc. He has been running this business for five years. He works at the business from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., seven days per week.  His business is the only source of income he has. Ibrahim says that the main challenges to his business are price inflation and high rental fees.\r\n\r\nIbrahim has requested a loan in order to buy more ladies' sandals, shoes, slippers and crape for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow him to increase his business and educate his children. In the future, he plans to expand his business more. He thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1281295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

is 30 years old. She lives in the Gurjaani District with her husband, Jumber, and four children, ages 2, 6, 8 and 12. \r\n\r\nTea requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her agricultural business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. According to government estimates, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category, and they get monthly social assistance.\r\n\r\nThe family grows strawberries on the family-owned land, and the harvested products are sold at the local open market. In addition, Tea and Jumber are daily workers in local farmers\u2019 fields.  \r\n\r\nTea requested a loan from Credo to start livestock farming. Her loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program facilitates business start-ups and re-startups with credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Tea will purchase calves. She will raise them and sell them after several months. Grown calves will be sold for a good price, bringing additional income to the family. For the next cycle, Tea will purchase more calves. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Their income will double, and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1281308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kalauri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115809,"comment":null},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355861291,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:27:32Z","rounded_local_amount":72.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364570094,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:11:43Z","rounded_local_amount":82.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968727,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":124.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749144,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":72.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613050,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399856782,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":82.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133451,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":82.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107061,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":155.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254643,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T16:01:49Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:22:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520140,"name":"Benina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benina's group is comprised of three hardworking women.

She is single, and has two children who are currently in school. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Betty has been working hard to sell vegetables from her vegetable stall. To help expand her business, Betty has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy a stock of fresh vegetables sell; it will help Betty generate greater profits, and change their way of living.  Betty hopes that in the future, she will be able to increase her business stock. \r\n\r\nBetty is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1281309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She says that the main challenges to her business are reduced purchasing power of her customers and transportation costs.\r\nFanta needs a loan in order to buy more cosmetics, including creams, Vaseline and baby powder.

tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLa Parroquia de Aluriqu\u00edn guarda paisajes inimaginables, en donde tambi\u00e9n se puede practicar deportes de aventura y est\u00e1 solo apenas a 20  minutos de la ciudad. Lugar poblado por contadas familias que se han dedicado a las actividades agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias como es el caso de Sandra, una mujer joven de 22 a\u00f1os que a pesar de los obst\u00e1culos econ\u00f3micos y personales, pudo terminar con \u00e9xito la secundaria y ahora vive con su pareja Darwin de 24 a\u00f1os con quien tiene un hijo a quien espera apoyarle siempre hasta verlo convertido en profesional. \nSandra se dedica a la crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n. Debido a la falta de capital y oportunidades de cr\u00e9ditos, no ha podido incrementar su negocio en el cual tiene mucha experiencia. Para lograr este objetivo ha solicitado un cr\u00e9dito a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le brindaron agilidad y confianza. Aprovechando esta oportunidad, Sandra ha incluido a sus amigos emprendedores como ella para obtener un pr\u00e9stamo grupal el cual ser\u00e1 invertido en cada uno de sus negocios. En el caso de Sandra comprar\u00e1 algunos pollos e insumos para su crianza al igual que Juan quien adem\u00e1s cr\u00eda y comercializa cerdos con la ayuda de su esposa para as\u00ed poder sustentar a sus 3 hijos y darles una educaci\u00f3n y estilo de vida dignos. Y finalmente Deysi de 35 a\u00f1os que trabaja para  sacar adelante a su hija y lo hace vendiendo ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos y bisuter\u00eda la cual espera incrementar y comprar al por mayor con el pr\u00e9stamo para obtener descuentos y tener mayor utilidad. \nLos integrantes de este grupo tienen en com\u00fan que se movilizan a la ciudad y parroquias aleda\u00f1as para vender sus productos, lo cual se convierte en trabajo duro y esforzado cada d\u00eda pero sin embargo no ha sido causa para que alguno se d\u00e9 por vencido, pues sus motivaciones personales y familiares les fortalecen para seguir adelante y luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"The San Jos\u00e9 de Alluriqu\u00edn parish is located in central northwest Ecuador in a rural area that is full of fertile land and leafy trees.  It is in Santo Domingo, the capital of the San Jos\u00e9 de Alluriqu\u00edn province in Santo Domingo.  It is an Ecuadorean province that has experienced a high, sustained level of growth in recent years. The capital is a city which offers attractive, colorful, delicious fruits and cuisine. It also has a considerable amount of commerce as it has become a dry port where commercial exchange takes place between the country's mountainous and coastal regions.  It also has various tourist attractions, which are very popular with national and international tourists, and a warm climate.  That is why most of the city\u2019s inhabitants have undertaken a commercial business activity or provide services for its residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nThe Aluriqu\u00edn parish has unbelievable scenery where you can practice adventure sports, and it is just 20 minutes from the city.  Families in the area have devoted themselves to agricultural and livestock business activities.  This is the case with Sandra.  She is a 22 year old woman, who in spite of financial and personal obstacles, was able to successfully complete high school.  She now lives with her life partner, 24 year old Darwin.  They have a son, whom they hope to always support until he becomes a professional.  Sandra raises chickens to later sell.  Due to the lack of capital and loan opportunities, she has not been able to increase her business in which she has a lot of experience.  In order to achieve this objective she has requested a loan, which was offered speedily and with confidence, from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, Sandra has joined together with enterprising friends who are like her in order to get a group loan.  The loan will be invested in each one of their businesses.  Sandra will buy some chickens and supplies for raising them.  \r\n\r\nJuan will do the same.  He also, with his wife\u2019s help, raises and sells pigs.  They do this in order to be able to support their three children, to give them an education, and to give them a decent life style.  \r\n\r\nLastly, Deysi is 35 years old.  She works in order to get her daughter ahead.  She does this by selling clothes, cosmetics, and jewelry.  She hopes to increase sales and use the loan to buy wholesale in order to get discounts and to have greater profits.\r\n\r\nThe thing the members of the group have in common is that they move around the city and nearby parishes to sell their products.  This becomes hard work that requires a great deal of effort every day.  Nevertheless, it has not been the reason for any of them to give up.  Their personal and familial motivations strengthen them so that they continue on and fight for their dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":1275903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens, feed, and supplies for the chicken coops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T15:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T15:50:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deysi Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Agustin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1414.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":221.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":228.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":235.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.65},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":243.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":248}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":222.72,"local_amount":221.1,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":222.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516841,"comment":null},{"amount":229.95,"local_amount":228.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":229.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068696,"comment":null},{"amount":237.13,"local_amount":235.4,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":237.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494962,"comment":null},{"amount":240.39,"local_amount":238.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":240.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524890,"comment":null},{"amount":245,"local_amount":243.22,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":245,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133194,"comment":null},{"amount":249.81,"local_amount":248,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":249.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313735,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T18:11:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517689,"name":"Jonathan Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jonathan es un joven trabajador de 22 a\u00f1os, es soltero y tiene un hijo de apenas un a\u00f1o y 4 meses.

Otras de las actividades sobresalientes son la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda, produciendo abundantes cultivos que luego son comercializados para distribuirse hacia muchas provincias.

Jonathan aprendi\u00f3 desde muy chico a trabajar con los cultivos, pues su diario vivir en el campo lo llevaron a aprender. Jonathan tambi\u00e9n juega f\u00fatbol en su tiempo libre que es muy poco ya que dedica al cuidado y cosecha de los cultivos al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda.

","en":"Jonathan is a hard-working young man of 22 years of age. He is single and has a son who is only a year and four months old. Jonathan grew up in a family of scant economic resources who were in unity even in difficult circumstances. They made a living from agriculture. Thanks to his parents, Jonathan finished secondary school. He now lives with his father Ricardo in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pichincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador. This canton is found a few kilometers away from the city of Quito and has many forests. Its neighborhoods are populated with kind people and customs native to this city, in which there are different microbusinesses run by enterprising people who fight each day to make their dreams a reality. Other activities include agriculture and farming - producing abundant crops which are later sold and distributed to many other provinces. It also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, trails, and spas, which tourists are attracted to for safety-guaranteed adventure sports. \n\nWith the help of his father, Jonathan grows naranjillas, a fruit common to Latin American countries. It has prickly skin but a juicy and acidic pulp, with which you can make nectars, desserts, and marmalades. You can plant them in any season but they require a lot of care to prevent pests and agricultural diseases from affecting them. Jonathan learnt to work with the crops from a very young age, but he is still learning the daily life of the land. Jonathan also plays soccer in his free time, of which he has little since he spends eight hours a day caring for and harvesting the crops. He also spends time looking after the livestock, which will later be sold. Jonathan dreams of continuing his studies and becoming a professional in the agricultural industry so that he can be an example and an inspiration to his son. Although he thinks that it is a job that requires a lot of dedication and effort, he does not think any activity is difficult because he has learnt from experience that every process has its routine. Jonathan needs to buy naranjilla seeds to increase the number of sown fields of naranjilla he has. He also needs to buy products to give better treatment to his animals so he can sell them at a higher price. Therefore, he is requesting a loan so he can carry out these objectives and obtain greater revenue for fulfilling his dreams.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1261.7,"image":{"id":1276776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Also, the family grows maize and potatoes on the family-owned land. All family members work hard, but the income is not enough for the three-member family. \r\n\r\nBakir requested credit to start a dairy farm. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions. These would be made available to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Bakir will purchase three milk cows and feed for them. He will place them in the old cattle-shed located in his yard. He will produce cheese and sell the cheese on the local open market. The income for the family will significantly increase and the living conditions for the family will improve.

She\u2019s lived with Riter, 43, for 28 years and they are the parents of two children who are 17 and 21 years old.  She was able to buy her own house four years ago thanks to the money she and her spouse were able to save.  She spends her days there in the company of her entire family always giving her best to continue moving forward and reach her goals.\r\n\r\nLeodila\u2019s business consists in selling lumber and to do so she constantly travels to areas along the river where the lumber she needs is sold.  Everything she acquires is transported to the city in one of the boats used for river transport; they she looks for customers.  She\u2019s been doing this for nearly a year and works with help from her son-in-law.  She also has three additional boats she uses to transport passengers or merchandise to population centers along river banks.  Her main function is to enter into contract with merchants that transport goods to these places that are along her route.  With respect to people, all she has to do is call them together by means of an informative ad placed in the place she\u2019s headed to and once her boat has the recommended number of passengers she heads out providing all the required safety precautions.\r\n\r\nDuring the time she\u2019s been doing this, she\u2019s learned to know the material needs of inhabitants in the zones she visits and this has helped her determine the amount and frequency of visits she must make carrying the necessary goods.  Her profits are very good and this gives her much peace of mind and security to continue facing the adversities that might arise along the way.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #3 and she\u2019s very happy to know that she has financial support because she\u2019ll feel surer about advancing in her work.

She is married, has four children, and lives with the youngest in their own house, striving to get ahead to lead a better lifestyle.  Doris sells fish for a living, out of a stall she has in front of her house.  Fortunately, sales are high and she earns a good profit, thanks to the fact that her strategic location is on a visible corner.  But her work requires much sacrifice to get the quality, fresh products she sells to her customers.  She gets up early in the morning to go to the fishing port to get the most popular items, such as boquichico, sea urchin, sardines or catfish.  She knows the effort is worth it, since her daughter has everything she needs to live comfortably.  \r\n\r\nDoris has been in business for 11 years now, and works alone.  Her motivation for wanting to get ahead is her desire to do a good job and earn an income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys the freedom her work gives her, since she can spend the afternoons practicing some sport, while spending time with her family.  She hopes to continue expanding her business and begin selling bananas.  This is her second loan through the MFP institution.  She is grateful to all the people who make this loan possible, allowing her to continue toward her goal.  She is committed to paying off the loan on time.\r\n\r\nThe amount requested will be used to buy fish and bananas so she can continue working."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1280345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a variety of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":119.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":131.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":138.98},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":146.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.45,"local_amount":119.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T09:01:06Z","rounded_local_amount":123.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122969,"comment":null},{"amount":51.57,"local_amount":126.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":131.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868790,"comment":null},{"amount":53.5,"local_amount":131.69,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":136.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577631,"comment":null},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":136.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529862,"comment":null},{"amount":56.46,"local_amount":138.98,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":144.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974892,"comment":null},{"amount":59.52,"local_amount":146.52,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":151.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996149,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T16:55:56Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:53:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520161,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane is 57 years old.

is 32 years old and lives in the Marneuli District with his parents, brother, wife and two children. He and his brother are artisans and his father works at a poultry farm. They all earn a monthly salary, but Bakhruz is requesting this loan from Kiva and Credo to start a new business on his own. Kiva and Credo run a loan program for start-ups that provides credit on favorable terms to poor people who live in rural areas and do not have access to traditional sources of credit.

is 29 years old. He lives in the suburbs of Tbilisi with his family: wife, parents-in-law and sister-in-law.  Ivane\u2019s wife is a waitress and his father-in-law serves the locals as a taxi driver. Ivane\u2019s economic activity is his newly-started business. In particular he is a shoe-maker and sews shoes. Ivane requested credit to expand his business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

is married with seven children; only three of her children go to school. She also takes care of her cousin. She operates a retail shop at the market and has been in this business for two years selling to all categories of people on retail.

Every day she spends about $1 on kerosene for lighting and $0.50 on charcoal and firewood for cooking. With a biogas source, she will spare this money and use it to expand her farming business.\n\nFrom the biogas she will also produce slurry, which she will use on her land to increase production.

He now plans to invest more into farming, and maybe he will do cash crop farming.\r\n\r\nHe was invited to join Milango by his friends, and he joined to access capital. Masudi is applying for a loan of 10,650 Kenyan shillings to pay for seeds, fertilizer and labor. He believes this is a good venture, which will help to improve his family's food security.

She has been running a charcoal business for three years now.  She works from 8.00am to 7.00pm daily and is able to make a fair monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Salma's fourth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania Ltd.

This will enable them to have a better standard of living and ensure that their children can continue going to school. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1277698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds and supplies for growing potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Esperanza, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-01-22T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-21T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.66,"local_amount":1261.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1288.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347045963,"comment":null},{"amount":66.31,"local_amount":1293.94,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356476780,"comment":null},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":1284.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1311.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364498806,"comment":null},{"amount":67.02,"local_amount":1307.78,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1335.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373118845,"comment":null},{"amount":141.89,"local_amount":2768.49,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2826.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381922831,"comment":null},{"amount":67.91,"local_amount":1325.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1352.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399793684,"comment":null},{"amount":67.23,"local_amount":1311.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1339.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410070192,"comment":null},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":1134.68,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833688,"comment":null},{"amount":426,"local_amount":8312.07,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":8485.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-22T20:48:47Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:13:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520254,"name":"Jennet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennet is 34 years old and lives in the area of Kakata Town, the capital city of Margibi County, which is the highest producing rubber plantation in Liberia.

She is enterprising, and has the desire to improve herself and get ahead in life. She has faced an obstacle with her education, as her parents are low income and couldn't give her the opportunity to go to school. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband decided to look for opportunities to succeed, considering that they had tremendous potential in terms of youth, good health, and her strong desire for an additional livelihood apart from being just a housewife. Her husband has worked the land all his life, where his work enables him to support the household. \r\n\r\nBoth saw the need for one of the two to find a way of generating a bit more income, and an opportunity arose for Javy to take a beauty salon course offered by FUDEIMFA, the technical arm of the COMIXMUL cooperative. Thanks to this opportunity, she learned to fend for herself in a different way. She trained in cutting men's and women's hair. Currently she goes from house to house, serving people of all ages, with only two pairs of scissors, a cape and two combs.\r\n\r\nJavy is now requesting help to buy tools and supplies for work, such as a hair dryer and hair iron, a chair, mirrors, a table, capes, combs and brushes.

is 17 years old and lives in the town of Mubende in the Mubende region of Uganda.

The loan will be used to buy more soft drinks such as lemonade and passion fruit juice and a fridge for cooling, and will help Rose to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children and also renovate her chicken farm house. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to build her own house. \n\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Her primary income sources are crops and personal business.\n\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: She enjoys horticultural farming because of the high returns! Her biggest challenge is high input prices. Animals on the farm have been given the names of Kagoiya, Wambura, Munugu, Kabara.\nAnnah has been  in horticultural farming but has requested a loan of 10,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy  dairy goats for a venture into dairy farming.\n\n\nWhen asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, Annah replied that she needed loans to be able to expand her farming.  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, and she learned that she could expand her dairy farming through micro finance loans.\n\nAnnah's highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', she replied that she will be able to cater for the family's needs.\n\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ann owns poultry and a bicycle but does not own a cow, pig, pump, motorcycle or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household  a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, TV, or a DVD.\n\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":111.35,"image":{"id":1242416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Having gotten a taste for it, he is now planning to expand by planting 1,000 new plants. Instead of buying seedlings \u2013 transplant-ready cacao grown in bags for at least six months \u2013 Felipe will have an on-farm nursery where he will grow his own seedlings. The principal reason for the expansion is to support his children who can eventually take over. \n\nHis favorite part about cacao farming is seeing the trees covered in pods and the time when everybody gets together for harvest. The less exciting side to cacao is cleaning and maintenance, says Felipe, as it keeps farmers in the fields and working hard. Besides cacao, Felipe also grows corn and beans, which he sells locally. \n\nFelipe is requesting this loan to hire help to set up the nursery as well as clean and prune his productive cacao trees. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush to clear access to trees for pruning and harvest or prepare the soil for transplanting new cacao seedlings. Pruning is the process of cutting the non-productive branches and is necessary to increase yields and prolong the lifetime of a cacao tree.

He lives with his wife Rebecca and five children in the village of San Jose. Cacao farming is a tradition that runs in the family, and Santiago has chosen to follow it with enthusiasm.\n\nCacao is great because it helps farmers with cash, says Santiago. There is little liquidity in the Mayan villages, where cacao is the only source of income for many a farmer. Santiago\u2019s favorite time in the cacao growing cycle is harvest, because it brings in money and facilitates investment in home improvement among other things. In the near future he hopes to build a home that better accommodates his growing family. \n\nTwo of Santiago and Rebecca\u2019s children are currently of school age. The family hopes to put the kids through school so they can become professionals in their chosen field and get jobs in town. In Belize, schooling is not required past primary (6-14) education, and schools charge tuition for children enrolled in any level of education. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan in order to do maintenance on the farm and expand by transplanting new seedlings. Maintenance includes cleaning and pruning the fields. Cleaning means cutting the underbrush to clear access to trees for harvest and pruning or preparing land for transplanting new trees. Cleaning is a routine activity for farmers living in the lush tropical lowlands and needs to be done three to four times per year.

A farmer from an early age, Honorato says farming is no joke, and wants to provide his children an education to help them get a head start. \n\nHonorato got into farming cacao five years ago encouraged by other farmers and by the promise of a stable and guaranteed market for the crop. He is now farming two acres \u2013 around 600 cacao trees. Honorato says cacao is a good crop because it\u2019s long term: \u201cyou don\u2019t have to replant it, just clean, prune and take good care.\u201d The tricky part of cacao farming for Honorato has been the fungal pod rot disease Monilia, and the trees that go straight up without producing. \u201cWe call them suckers, because they suck the top of the soil without giving anything back,\u201d he professed.  \n\nHis favorite thing about cacao is the moment after the trees are cleaned and pruned. \u201cThen I really appreciate my field. Trees are looking nice and sailing with the breeze,\u201d Honorato says with a smile, adding that harvest is also a fun time. \n\nWith children between the ages of four and 17, and possibly one more in the planning, there are school fees to worry about. However, kids are indispensable assistants to help out at harvest. Macrina also helps with harvest, but also fermenting and drying as well as shelling and grinding cacao for the hot cacao drink that is omnipresent in Mayan homes. Honorato is asking for the loan to expand his farm by buying and transplanting 600 seedlings as well as cleaning two acres of cacao.

Gabino says the family will continue farming cacao, and they have reason to be proud of their product. \n\nGabino\u2019s enthusiasm for cacao farming is contagious, he told us, as he recently got his brother to start and enjoy farming alongside his town job. Gabino is requesting this loan to hire two people for two weeks to help him clean and prune his 600 bearing cacao trees and clear access to the 500 trees newly planted in June. Besides the benefit of clearing access to the cacao trees, cutting the underbrush has the side benefit of producing firewood that can be used for the daily cooking activities. Pruning is an important investment for cacao farmers as it is said to increase yields in the coming season and extend the lifetime of cacao trees. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1281742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Cleaning and pruning four acres of cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863446,"comment":null},{"amount":26.26,"local_amount":47.74,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098934,"comment":null},{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":47.97,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971149,"comment":null},{"amount":26.53,"local_amount":48.23,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751674,"comment":null},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":48.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993415,"comment":null},{"amount":26.78,"local_amount":48.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":53.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255584,"comment":null},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":53.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136425,"comment":null},{"amount":27.05,"local_amount":49.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":53.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900642,"comment":null},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":49.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":54.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088526,"comment":null},{"amount":35.12,"local_amount":63.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":70.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202030,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:32:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520308,"name":"Cifriano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cifriano, age 64, and his wife Eusebia-Leona have brought up seven children, the youngest of who is already 20.

Transplanting means planting into the ground cacao seedlings that are typically raised in special bags for at least six months prior.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.88,"image":{"id":1281745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Clean, prune and expand cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"San Jose","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cifriano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":47.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863447,"comment":null},{"amount":26.26,"local_amount":47.74,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098935,"comment":null},{"amount":26.39,"local_amount":47.98,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971150,"comment":null},{"amount":26.52,"local_amount":48.22,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751675,"comment":null},{"amount":26.65,"local_amount":48.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993416,"comment":null},{"amount":26.78,"local_amount":48.7,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":53.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255585,"comment":null},{"amount":26.92,"local_amount":48.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":53.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136426,"comment":null},{"amount":27.05,"local_amount":49.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":53.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900643,"comment":null},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":49.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":54.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088527,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:01:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520312,"name":"Justo Patrocinio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justo Patrocinio lives in the village of Santa Elena, on a road that leads to the Guatemalan border. Justo and his wife Irma have 8 children, the youngest of whom is four and the oldest 22. The older boys helped plant and take care of the cacao farm, and are now searching for jobs in town, while the younger are interested in and counted on for help around the farm. \n\nJusto likes farming cacao because it both brings in money and can be used to make your own chocolate drink. The drink of the Gods, as it was regarded by the ancient Mayas and limited to the elites, is very commonplace in the Maya communities today. You can make it by grinding the cacao beans (usually by hand) and molding cacao balls that can be dissolved in hot water for a rich and nutritious beverage. \n\nJusto is requesting this loan to hire five people for a week to help him clean four acres of cacao. Cleaning underbrush is a routine activity for cacao farmers in the tropical lowlands. Cacao grows in agroforestry-type ecosystems with varying levels of vegetation and on fertile jungle soil that is especially productive and non-selective about what it grows, so farmers have to be. \n\nLike few farmers in his village, Justo has diversified his crops and besides the typical combination of cacao, corn and beans, he grows fruit trees like starfruit and soursop, coffee and cardamom. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you start things because there\u2019s no money at that point. I have to wait for harvest time,\u201d he explains the difficulty in investing to diversify his farm. In the future, Justo wants to invest in more trees and do some reconstruction on the house. If he works hard this year, he says he might afford to buy a solar panel to illuminate the house before his daughter starts high school. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":229.19,"image":{"id":1281753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Cleaning four acres of cacao farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Santa Elena","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T00:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T00:30:04Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justo Patrocinio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863448,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365098936,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971151,"comment":null},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751676,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993417,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-08T09:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255586,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136427,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900644,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088528,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":45.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202031,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T01:34:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520314,"name":"Firmo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Firmo, his wife Veronica and their eight children \u2013 aged two to 17 \u2013 live in the village of Pueblo Viejo.

terminar la escuela primaria. Tiene 2 hijos a quienes visita con cierta frecuencia. Vive en la casa de familiares en el cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. Jos\u00e9 reside en la Parroquia Puerto Lim\u00f3n de este cant\u00f3n, un sector que fue habitado por una comunidad ts\u00e1chila y tiene varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos. Adem\u00e1s los habitantes de esta parroquia en su gran mayor\u00eda, se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda.\nJos\u00e9 se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de cacao y pl\u00e1tano verde. Aprendi\u00f3 con sus padres desde que era un ni\u00f1o y la puso en pr\u00e1ctica desde hace 8 a\u00f1os cuando emprendi\u00f3 con los cultivos y la venta de su fruto. Jos\u00e9 es un hombre eminentemente campesino,  trabaja d\u00eda a d\u00eda y es poseedor de una incansable e inagotable fuerza de trabajo, su gran obst\u00e1culo para que crezca su negocio se encontr\u00f3 en la dificultad de obtener pr\u00e9stamos en entidades financieras porque a\u00fan no ha podido obtener las escrituras que avalan la finca de su propiedad, pues est\u00e1 dentro de una comunidad ts\u00e1chila por lo que ha tenido problemas pero sin embargo no ha sucumbido ante las inclemencias clim\u00e1ticas, econ\u00f3micas y sociales, es por esto que Jos\u00e9 requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para poder realizar una resiembra de sus cultivos de pl\u00e1tano verde que es muy cotizado en la zona para venderlo en el mercado pues las amas de casa lo preparan cocinado, frito, en pastel o muchas formas m\u00e1s que deleitan el paladar nacional e internacional. Jos\u00e9 agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la confianza brindada, pues ya es la segunda vez que le otorgan un cr\u00e9dito, por lo que se puede apreciar que adem\u00e1s Jos\u00e9 es un cliente muy cumplido en sus pagos. ","en":"Jos\u00e9, 22, is a single young man who, following the customs and traditions of his community, finished primary school.  He has two children, whom he visits with some frequency.  He lives in the house of some relatives in Santo Domingo Canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.\r\n\r\nSanto Domingo connects the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador.  It's a city that has become a commercial crossroads with several developing sectors. As proof of this, there are many enterprising families here who started out with small businesses a few years ago and now are micro-business owners who generate employment. Studies show that all the businesses for the most part started out empirically and have been well-received by tourists, businessmen, and travelers who go from one region to the other.  In addition, this is the country\u2019s third most populous city.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 lives in Puerto Lim\u00f3n Parish in this canton, an area that was inhabited by a Ts\u00e1chila community and has several tourist attractions.  In addition, the vast majority of residents in this parish make a living in agriculture and livestock.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 makes a living growing cacao and green plantains, which he learned from his parents at a young age and started doing eight years ago when he started growing and selling his fruit.  Jos\u00e9 is a consummate farmer.  He works every day and has an untiring and inexhaustible energy for work.\r\n\r\nHis big obstacle is that, for his business to grow, he had difficulty getting loans from financial institutions because he still hasn't gotten the papers that guarantee the farm he owns, which is within a Ts\u00e1chila community so he has had problems.  Nevertheless, he has not succumbed to weather, economic, and social harshness.\r\n\r\nThis is why he needs a loan to be able to replant his green plantain crops, which is highly valued in the area for sale in the market because the housewives prepare it cooked, fried, in pastry, or in many other forms that please the national and international palate.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for their confidence in him, because this is the second time they have given him a loan.  This shows that Jos\u00e9 is also a client who makes his payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":997.68,"image":{"id":1281706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to replant banana trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Ignacio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1077.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":72.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":84.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":86.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":89.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":94.72},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":96.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":98.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.79},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.24,"local_amount":72.7,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":74.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068706,"comment":null},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":84.27,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494974,"comment":null},{"amount":85.79,"local_amount":84.01,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":85.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524902,"comment":null},{"amount":88.03,"local_amount":86.2,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133206,"comment":null},{"amount":89.21,"local_amount":87.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":89.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313745,"comment":null},{"amount":91.41,"local_amount":89.51,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565351,"comment":null},{"amount":92.78,"local_amount":90.86,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":92.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814392,"comment":null},{"amount":94.61,"local_amount":92.65,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320568,"comment":null},{"amount":96.73,"local_amount":94.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":96.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856265,"comment":null},{"amount":98.38,"local_amount":96.34,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":98.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059843,"comment":null},{"amount":100.45,"local_amount":98.37,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":100.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-23T04:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520324,"name":"Marilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marilyn, a 43-year-old mother, and a resident of Taguig, Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP to help her in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an expansion in her business income as she enlarges her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita hopes that her business will grow and expand. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

live in a mountainous area, where electricity is only available a few hours per day.  It also happens that, sometimes, there is no electricity at all.\r\n\r\nHusnoro and her husband are involved in fattening up livestock.  They keep their animals at home, fatten them up and then resell them for a profit. \r\n\r\nHusnoro recently learned from her neighbors about the possibility of getting a green loan from Kiva in order to purchase a special equipment to conserve heat and prepare food.\r\n\r\nUntil now, she had always used an old traditional stove, which was constantly in need of repair.  However, she now has the opportunity to buy an energy-efficient stove which will allow her to cook, bake pies, and heat her house at the same time, providing warmth and comfort.\r\n\r\nHusnoro and her family are very thankful to Kiva for helping them realize this project.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":180.69,"image":{"id":1280426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

He has been providing transportation services to local people using his own minivan since 2006. The minivan he uses for transportation is purchased with a leasing service. His son is 12 years old and goes to high school. Last year he began building a large family house on the plot of land. The house will be complete this summer because using his previous loan he purchased cement, bricks, planks and sand. However due to a lack of finances, he can\u2019t afford to pay all the construction costs. He is now requesting a loan of 4,150,000 MNT to cover the costs related to building his house. These costs include but are not limited to paying workers, installing a heating and conditioner system and connecting to an electricity line. As a result, he and his family will be able to live in their long awaited house with happiness. Most importantly, the high quality house will have an impact on coal usage due to its heat preserving feature. Burning less coal has considerable positive effects on efforts against air

","en":"Mayramjon is a 35-year-old woman. She is married and has 3 children. Her occupation is manufacturing traditional baby cradles. This is a family business: Mayramjon's husband builds the cradles, while she paints and varnishes them. The family makes very attractive and high-quality products and has many regional customers who make large-volume purchases of the cradles.

is 50 years old. He lives in Mtskheta District with his two sons and a daughter-in-law. Merab requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \n\nMerab and his son work as artisans and get a monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence-poor category. \n\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low incomes. \n\nWith the received credit, Merab will purchase a car. After purchasing a car, he plans to serve local people as a taxi driver. This will increase the income of the family.

She would like to improve her work conditions by renewing her work area that needs some renovation in order to be more pleasant. To be able to pay for the work she took a loan from Kiva partner Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three  to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

is a 39-year-old Iraqi woman. She is married and a mother of four children. Her career options are limited because of cultural restrictions and domestic constraints. That is why she is one of many Iraqi woman who work from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and help meet the financial needs of her family. She now has three years' experience running a small, home-based sewing and tailoring business. She makes custom dresses to order, along with other small items made out of various fabrics. She uses an old sewing machine, typically while sitting on the floor and bending over the machine.

is a young 27 year-old Iraqi woman. She is married and has no children yet. \r\n\r\nShagul is the owner of a beauty salon where she works as a hair dresser and beautician. She has five years experience with her shop and she is proud of her achievements. She is constantly working on improving the services and general experience for her customers. In the past, she took a loan which she used to buy mirrors for the salon, an A\/C unit and some small decorations for the shop. Having successfully repaid that loan, she is now taking a new loan to buy a small generator for the shop which will make it easier for her to work during the hours when the city power is off.

He owns several heads of cattle and one dairy cow producing 10 liters [2.6 gal] of milk every day. Jonibek\u2019s wife sells this milk to neighbors and acquaintances. They receive a good income from this work and try to develop their business.\r\n\r\nJonibek would like to use his loan to buy several bags of cattle feed.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Zurab will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. The income of Zurab will increase and he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family. Along with the above-mentioned, Zurab will have enough income to access regular credit products available in the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1239.39,"image":{"id":1281347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

is 27 years old, married, and lives in Martkopi with her husband and two infant children. Several times, Sopiko has applied for loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and lack of experience in her new business. The local credit providers usually insist on prior experience in the business. One source of income for the family is the small monthly income earned by Sopiko, who is involved in a clothing trading business. She buys used clothing and resells these items to her neighbors. Aside from that, her husband works as a taxi driver. Sopiko requested a loan from Credo to start up her own store to sell clothing herself. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start credits on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Sopiko will purchase building materials and build a store. She will buy used clothes for wholesale prices and resell them in her store for a profit. It will be hard work for Sopiko, but, according to estimates, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in clothing to increase her trading stock and sales volume.

When Carlos gets the loan he plans to use it to buy blocks, cement and iron rods, among other building supplies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1282465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy building supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-01-23T19:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-22T19:30:16Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.11,"local_amount":1833.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-21T08:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1861.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347758220,"comment":null},{"amount":77.06,"local_amount":1833.18,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1861.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356527060,"comment":null},{"amount":77.69,"local_amount":1847.82,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1875.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364568265,"comment":null},{"amount":82.7,"local_amount":1966.82,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1996.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373162883,"comment":null},{"amount":75.48,"local_amount":1795.24,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1822.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381968662,"comment":null},{"amount":83.39,"local_amount":1983.42,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2013.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390830470,"comment":null},{"amount":74.58,"local_amount":1773.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1800.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855278,"comment":null},{"amount":78.77,"local_amount":1873.55,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1902,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130593,"comment":null},{"amount":78.58,"local_amount":1868.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1897.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419896271,"comment":null},{"amount":219.64,"local_amount":5223.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5302.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545590,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-24T14:07:32Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T18:58:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520672,"name":"Korpo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Korpo is 27 years old and lives in Paynesville, which is one of the populated areas in Montserrado County.

They are very pleased to inform you that their previous Kiva loan has made a huge impact in their businesses and personal lives. With the help of that loan, they were able to add to their business inventories. This led to an increase in sales and profit. They used the profit they made to repay the loan, feed their children and send them to school.\r\n\r\nHaving repaid the previous loan successfully, they are requesting a new loan now, of SLL 700,000 for each member, in order to further improve on the quality and quantity of the respective businesses.\r\n\r\nThe featured leader, Aminata, is going to use her share of the loan to buy a large quantity of fish to add to her current stock of fish.

All the children are still minors and so Juana and her husband care for them in the house they bought fifteen years ago.  \r\n\r\nEvery day, Juana and her husband go out to care for the corn and potato crops on their own lands, which they tend with great care.  She likes agriculture a lot.  She saw a way of using the leftover fertilizers and seeds, and built a nursery in her home where she plants diverse herbs and vegetables.  This serves Juana for her own use: \"In this, I don't spend a lot on food for my children; furthermore, [the herbs and vegetables] are of a good quality, since they are organic,\" she says.  \r\n\r\nIn the harvest season, she sells her products in the city of Huancayo, where she also brings her nursery foods to sell; she is already an expert of the city and of the businesspeople there.  She currently has two cows that she thinks of feeding and fattening in order to be able to milk them and thereby make cheese.  She hopes to solidify her new project, and to also sell these products in the city, taking advantage of the trips she already makes to trade the products from her own harvests.  \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.
