has lived in the Alor District of West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia since he was born 21 years ago. Alor is a small village with very low economic growth, even though in that village there are a lot of small harbors, because the education level is really low. Lukas' parents work as farmers with income of only 150,000 IDR (around $16 US) per month. He has three brothers who are nine, eight and five years old. His brothers can\u2019t go to school anymore. Lukas chose to leave his village because he really wants to continue his education in the Maritime Academy. Lukas hopes that the loan from Kiva will give him a challenge to make his family's living conditions better, because when he graduates from the Maritime Academy, he will get a job on a National or International ship as a professional sailor and will get a good salary.

is 20 years old and comes from the Belu District in Atambua. Belu is on the border of Indonesia and Timor Leste. Belu is part of Indonesia, with a lot of small harbors. Thomas' father works as a driver and sometimes is a car mechanic with an income of only 500.000 IDR a month, which covers just the basic needs of his family. Thomas has four siblings. The three youngest can\u2019t continue their school and his brother had to drop out a few years ago because his father couldn't pay the educational fees for all of his children. Thomas heard that Maritime Academy in Cilacap gives student loans for poor families like his.

Jean Claude was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is Angelita, 43, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Jeter and a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAngelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  Angelita  earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Angelita is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelita hopes to grow her business and dreams that her children will all finish college through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1198085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to restock her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-24T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-24T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114774,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350828,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959934,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2758.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094647,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1378.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339483824,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-24T15:37:03Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474114,"name":"Saren's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A citizen from a rural village of the Kror Kor district of Pursat province, Cambodia, Saren is a 38-year-old mother of four children, three of whom are dependent on her.

She has farmed rice on a 1.5 hectare area of farmland for eighteen years and complemented her family\u2019s income by selling grocery items. She can earn around 20,000 KHR per day and save about 10,000 KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is 33 years old. He is married to a farmer. They have one child aged four. He has been a maize farmer for 17 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the photo taken recently at another maize farming plantation, he was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He lives with his wife and three children who are between the ages of 10 and 18. For the past five years he has had a store where he sells food, groceries, and general goods from the family food basket. His main customer base is located in the area where he lives. They purchase small quantities from him daily using cash in accordance with the families\u2019 income. \r\n\r\nHis experience dates back to when he was an assistant in a store, and little by little he learned how to manage the business. He starts work at 5 a.m. and continues until 10 in the evening after the last customer leaves. He mainly makes his purchases in cash at the granaries and the market plaza where they give him good prices. \r\n\r\nLately his clientele has increased, and his inventory has been turning over quickly. Many customers come and buy out many of his products, which is why he is turning to a Kiva loan. This is the first loan at the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use the loan to purchase groceries such as rice, oil, sugar, cereal grains, and frozen meats. \r\n\r\nBeing fully stocked will increase his sales, and little by little he can achieve his goal of expanding the infrastructure of the premises, extending it to the corner of his home. That would make it more convenient for him and more comfortable for his customers, helping him build customer loyalty. He also wants to ensure the well being of his children.

is 63 years old. He is married to a farmer and they both have four children. He has been a maize farmer for 40 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at a previous maize farming plantation. He was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

is Virginia, 64. She is a resident of Taguig, Philippines. Virginia is married to Cesar, a tricycle driver, and she is a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the businesses. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVirginia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVirginia hopes to have many loyal customers and dreams to have a good life with her family through all her hard work on her business.

Her customers usually buy items by catalog, which she gets by order.  She gets the rest of the merchandise from stores in the center of the city.  She primarily sells on credit.  She takes orders from her customers, who are mostly women who work for companies in the city, every two weeks.\r\n\r\nMeredith has received a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which served to amplify the market.  She has seen an immediate improvement with this investment.  This is because there is better coverage of the demand.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand the business with greater stock on hand.  In regards to her family, she dreams of getting her own house.  Her greatest challenge is to save enough to achieve her proposals.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan to buy cosmetics, women\u2019s and men\u2019s underwear, perfume, shoes, and sheets.  These are the products that are most requested by her clientele, and the purchases will be made during pre-sales.  The planned investment will be successful because it will cover the demand, which will enable the increase in her sales and her income.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1187458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. He rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue to operate his business, he is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts and accessories needed in his business. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nEddie dreams of having a bigger computer shop. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and were he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The photo was taken recently at a previous maize farming plantation. Grace was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Two of her children are dependent on her and still in school. She has been involved in selling grocery items for five years and supplementing her income by selling pork meats. The current business earns her approximately 22,000 KHR per day, and she manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n\r\nSorn has been with Kiva partner VisionFund for three cycles while the other member of her group is with VisionFund just this cycle. Sorn's past loans have helped her to build a new proper stall for supporting her grocery-selling business; all her loans have been repaid already. Now she and her group member are requesting a loan with VisionFund of 1,400,000 KHR and 1,000,000 KHR respectively. As the leader, Sorn is going to use her portion to buy more grocery items to sell such as sugar, salt and eggs, and also plans to use a portion of it to buy more pork for resale. She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her income so as to improve her standard of living and keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1197295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more

is 37 years old. She is married to a farmer. She has been a maize farmer for 16 years. She will use the Kiva loan to cover labor costs and fertilizer during maize production. She needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently with the previous maize crop. She was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both her family and business. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Paul was very happy and excited that the previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business progress. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under-served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

is 47 years old. He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 19 years. He will use this Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production; he needs the fertilizer in order to increase his production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at a different maize farming plantation. Bonaventure was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatima is the featured borrower for the Mohamad Group. She got together with her other group members to take this Al Majmoua loan because they have always been neighbors and friends. Fatima, seated on the right, is a 29-year-old married woman and mother of three children (Husein (m), 7 years; Zeinab, (f), 5 years; and Zahraa (f), 4 years). To help her husband in making their living and to take good care of her children, Fatima opened a nursery in her house five years ago. She does well in her business because most of the working mothers work hard to find a nursery that keeps their children in a safe and caring place. This was very smart because she is always home to respond to her children\u2019s needs. Fatima is also very talented in hairdressing and she sells beauty cosmetics, which provides extra income to her family and covers unexpected expenses.\n\nShe applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua in order to improve her hairdressing business through the purchase of necessary creams and tools such as a hair dryer, wax machine and make-up set.\n\nZeinab, seated in the middle, is a 43-year-old married woman and mother of three children (Hawraa (f), 14 years; Fatima (f), 12 years; and Mohamad (m), 9 years).

is 35 years old. She is married to a farmer. She has been a maize farmer for 10 years. She will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production.   She needs to buy fertilizer to increase her production. With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business, so that in the future she can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at  another maize plantation.  Yvonne was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product; generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is 50 years old. He is married to a farmer. He has been a maize farmer for 18 years. He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production.  He needs to buy fertilizer to increase his production. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business, so that in the future he can acquire machines like tractors that will enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken recently at another maize plantation.  Yvani was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product; generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

47, is a librarian and she has been working for 16 years nonstop in the college library in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. She is a widow and lives with her daughter in her studio apartment. Byarkhuu uses a furnace which uses coal to stay warm at home. Her daughter always has the flu due to feeling cold. So, Bayarkhuu wants to make repairs to her apartment. She is planning to put insulation in the windows and the wall corners. She will recover some broken and bad parts of the walls with cement and foam. This will reduce heat loss and Bayarkhuu will pay less for coal. Using coal is very harmful for her family's health and the environment, as she knows.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main reasons for Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems and to buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Bayarkhuu is taking will be dedicated to buying some building and insulation materials for her home repair. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1198288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy some building and insulation materials for her home repair.

Bat-Erdene, 28, has been a crane driver for a transportation company since 2009. Every day he loads and transports a lot of freight to the trucks or vans. He lives with his wife and his two sons in a poorly equipped house in Ger district, an area of Erdenet, the third largest city in Mongolia, with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Currently his wife is unemployed and looks after the babies at home. Bat-Erdene will use his loan to replace the dated wooden floor and windows in his home, improving its insulation (due to the heat loss through the existing windows). In winter he uses a water-heated furnace to keep his home warm. It is expensive and very wasteful of water. Bat-Erdene says if he can make his planned repairs, his heating costs will be cut notably and it will allow him to make a contribution to the environment.  \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  In winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  Furthermore, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is a main source of Mongolia's air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and buy cars which run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Bat-Erdene is taking will be used to buy building materials for his home repair.

This will help her gain more customers and improved income.\r\n\r\nJennifer's dream is to become a professional and to have her business constantly growing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1114.51,"image":{"id":1198738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"buy

Therefore, she is eager to make repairs and improve wall insulation with bricks and other building materials. The loan she is asking for will be used to buy the building materials and pay for hired workers to repair her house.

","en":"Abduvoris works as a taxi driver and drives his clients around town. However, his main source of income is fattening and resale of cattle. His wife helps him, as she stays at home and takes care of the animals. Last year Abduvoris has purchased cattle cheaply and now the prices have risen and he is planning to sell the cattle and purchase fodder for the winter. He also wants to use this loan to purchase a truck for cattle and hay transport. Abduvoris started to work with our organization in 2009. He used the first loan to purchase his taxi cab, but now he wants to sell it and purchase a truck for hay transport. Abdurovis is grateful for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1199899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is a farmer in Murang\u2019a, where he has practiced farming for twelve successive years. He is running his farm with two farmhands and is currently producing cabbages, tomatoes, flowers, and tea for the local market. He gets additional income from retailing horticultural products, which he sources from his farm as well as from other farmers in the area.\r\n\r\nJesee has made a request for 35,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy farm inputs for his horticultural farming business.

","en":"Juan de Dios is a 56 year old man who describes himself as very organized.  Proof of this is that after he retired from the store where he worked, he continued making contributions to the social security system to obtain his pension and he has already completed the contribution period required to qualify to receive his pension.  Now, he only has to wait until he is 60 years old.  Juan de Dios worked for several years as a salesman at a clothing store.  After retiring, he decided to start his own business.  He took advantage of the experience he had gained and the relationship that he had with the suppliers in order to undertake his business venture.  He still works from his home, which is his place of business.  Currently, he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will purchase curtains, tablecloths, towels, sheets, jeans, sweaters, pillows, fans, and blenders.  His dream is to find a business location with a medium-term rent in order to separate the business from his residence.

Her husband grows a mango tree for fruits for sales to gain additional income. It has been 21 years already that she has been engaged in this business. This is her fifth loan cycle with Kiva's partner VisionFund. She has paid back the past loans with success. They have helped her to keep up a good pace for her business, as well as better living conditions for her family.

Her husband is employed in a small general store, and one of her sons works in a repairing shop of cars. However, their income is very unpredictable and not enough to cover everyday expenditures. \n\nShe is a loving mother of six children; three of them are school-going while two stay at home. She is in charge of providing her family with good food, health and education. She has slowly but surely improved her business by taking loans from the Kashf Foundation. Now she requested a loan of Rs. 15,000 Pakistan rupees to buy stock of threads and pearls in different colors to meet the increasing demand for her embroidery designs. She hopes to have more profits and hence, better support her family. She desires to spend a part of earnings on two of her daughters' education.

She's forty-five years old, married and has one son. For the past seven years she's run an animal raising business. She owns two cows and two bulls. She has many buyers on the market and usually sells cattle to them after taking care of it for several months.

El origen del nombre de la comuna viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre de Quilicura equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles y que delimitan la comuna. \n","en":"This communal bank is named \"Santa Teresita\" and it's comprised of 15 entrepreneurs. They're in various lines of work, such as sewing, owning a sales stall, selling clothing, selling salads, cleaning products, selling cosmetics, providing services, etc. All of them belong to the township of Quilicura, located in the city of Santiago.\r\nClaudia is a member of the communal bank. In the photograph she's sitting in the front row, the first one from the left. She's wearing a black vest and black trousers, and she wears her dark brown hair down. She has her little niece sitting on her legs.\r\nShe's been in the weaving business for a year, specifically curtains, tablecloths and sheets. She reports that she works from home, Monday through Sunday, and sometimes she gets help from her daughter. She mentions that she learned to sew on her own.\r\nShe buys the materials she needs for weaving her sheets and curtains in the township of Independencia. The town is known for selling supplies both by wholesale and retail, at various quality levels and low prices, so it's financially convenient.\r\nWith the loan she'll purchase only supplies.\r\nOne of Claudia's goals is to stay in the weaving business and take some classes in order to hone her skills. Therefore she'll increase her profits and provide good living conditions for her children.\r\nClaudia lives with her husband, two children aged 12 and 24, and a little niece. Career-wise, her dream is to enlarge a room she has in her house. That way she'll put her machines there and she'll tend to her customers more easily.\r\nShe's very glad and grateful for the opportunity she's getting from Fondo Esperanza, because it will allow her to invest in her business. She reports that the training courses have been crucial for her business and also for her personal edification, since she's learned how to better organize and distribute her earnings and investments. As for the communal bank she's in, she feels very comfortable since they're close-knit and there's respect.\r\nQuilicura is a township that belongs to Santiago, capital of Chile, located in the far northwest of the metropolitan area. The town's name comes from the mapudungun (mapuche language) words \"kila\", which means \"three\", and \"kura\", which means \"rock\"; one can infer that the name Quilicura amounts to \"three rocks\". This name was given by the first inhabitants of this valley, as a reference to the three hills that are perfectly visible and define the township."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1200467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase only supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Quilicura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Transita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leslie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lloy Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1561920,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":106743},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":107466},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108192},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":108930},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":109680},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110418},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108513},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114249},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112689},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":113454},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":114222},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":115002},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":115782},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":116580}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":459.43,"local_amount":214209,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":215474.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147866,"comment":null},{"amount":937.75,"local_amount":437220,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":439803.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381023,"comment":null},{"amount":1207.8,"local_amount":563127,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":566454.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988173,"comment":null},{"amount":745.02,"local_amount":347364,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":349416.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331124650,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T19:15:13Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474376,"name":"Madiada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madiada, 43, lives in Kakata with her husband and has four children, aged between 11 and 29.

Anualitha was very happy and excited that previous season was very helpful for both family needs and business. \r\n\r\nThe agricultural sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market, and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1198460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy more fertiliser and support labor costs in the maize production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2012-09-25T02:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-25T02:00:13Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anualitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":776776,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":776776}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1050.83,"local_amount":627894,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":635754.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382234016,"comment":null},{"amount":249.17,"local_amount":148882,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":150745.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399939071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-27T22:39:55Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:42:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":475623,"name":"Sagrario Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sagrario, se dedica a la venta de pupusas y sorbetes artesanal, vive con sus hijos y su esposo, el negocio se administra desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os, con un horario de 5:30 a 10:00 de la tarde, su esposo se dedica a la venta de los sorbetes este negocio lo tienen bien instalado pero necesita capital para invertir en materia prima.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de chicharr\u00f3n, harina, aceite, condimentos, y otros ingredientes que son necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de la venta, esta ayuda le brindar\u00e1 los materiales necesarios y al mismo tiempo poder aumentar su producci\u00f3n, tambien espera pueda invertir una parte en la elaboracion de los sorbetes.\n\nSu objetivo es estabilizar su condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica trav\u00e9s de su trabajo diario, a futuro su sue\u00f1o es comprarse un veh\u00edculo para poder transportarse junto a su familia.\n\n\n","en":"Sagrario sells handmade pupusas (a thick corn tortilla stuffed with cheese, fried pork rind, chicken, or refried beans) and sorbets.
