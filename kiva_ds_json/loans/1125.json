After high school, Jon left his family home in New York to pursue active duty in the Marine Corps, where he learned more about information management and technology. After leaving the Marines, Jon pursued a college degree and in 2004 moved to San Diego to begin working in the field of computer management.  \r\n\r\nFrustrated with the lack of integrity and low commitment to helpful customer service commonly found in the industry, Jon looked for a way to provide better personal computer and information service to his clients. Through encouragement from a friend and colleague, Jon began to consider owning and managing his own business.  He was eventually offered an opportunity to take over a technology consulting firm, and he became the owner of All Connected Consulting.\r\n\r\nOver 10 years later, Jon continues to offer the highest customer service and innovative solutions to the clients who entrust him with their data.

has seen the serious consequences of drug addiction.  Many of his friends and members of his family suffered from this condition.   Witnessing the devastation of addiction affected Gustavo so deeply that he decided to volunteer at a halfway house for recovering addicts.\r\n\r\nThrough his volunteer work, Gustavo discovered that a drug testing facility didn\u2019t exist in Kaufman County, Texas.  He realized there was an opportunity to meet a need in the marketplace and follow through with his commitment to help recovering addicts and keep them accountable.\r\n\r\nCurrently all drug testing for companies and organizations in and around Kaufman County are sent to Dallas for lab testing \u2013 a time consuming and costly process.  So Gustavo started Anonymous Professional Testing and was able to fill the missing gap.  After learning about Accion Texas Inc., Gustavo applied for a loan for help with startup. Gustavo used his loan from Accion to purchase office supplies, as well as equipment and supplies such as test tubes, syringes and lab coats.  He also used the funds to rent office space for his business.\r\n\r\nGustavo is the proud father of two sons and resides in Garland, Texas.  He will continue offering drug testing services for his community.  Gustavo said he feels a great sense of empathy for his clients because he understands what they are facing, but also understands that with hard work, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

But his world and his finances collapsed when all in the same year, he and his first wife divorced and then he suffered a heart attack. Splitting the assets from his business with his ex-wife, coupled with an avalanche of medical bills after the heart attack, caused Joseph to become homeless for a brief period of time. \r\n\r\n\u201cI was living in this van and I could smell a hamburger that was grilling several blocks away,\u201d Joseph said, describing this time in his life. \u201cThat\u2019s how hungry I was.\u201d  \r\n\r\nJoseph picked up the pieces of his life by getting a job with a trucking company, and then going back to school to get his certification in accounting. Last year, he started a new life: he remarried and became a stepfather.  He also started a new business:  The Accounting Firm of Meizer & Meizer. \r\n\r\nJoseph does payroll and accounting services, specializing in transportation and warehousing companies. Joseph wanted to expand his services and to hire a part-time clerical worker so he could focus on sales. He applied for a small working capital loan with Accion Texas Inc. after a friend and client told him about the nonprofit organization.  Joseph is using his loan to buy a computer and software, to secure a lease for a small office space, and to hire a clerical worker. \r\n\r\n\u201cStarting a small business is like having a child,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI am at the toddler stage. A toddler is learning to walk, and gaining confidence, but he needs something to hold on to while he\u2019s getting on his feet.  Well, this loan is something to hold onto. And now my legs can get stronger and then I can move on from here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs business picks up, and Joseph builds his capital, he plans to expand his business, hire more workers, and then eventually go back into the trucking and transportation industry again. He knows he can do it because he ran successful companies in the past. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the ringer, but I never lost faith,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI really appreciate where I am

They want to give the area where they live a better atmosphere and to keep growing slowly.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is one of the members.  She is from a small neighborhood in the district where the city of Concepci\u00f3n is.  That is where she has her small business, a snack shop.  She works there every day starting in the very early hours of the morning.  She wishes that as time passes, and with help from all of the people from her area, they will be improving their environment.  This way they will give better security to their families and they will also be able to give them a better future.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to buy supplies for her snack shop.  She will buy things like drinks, candy, baked goods, and the rest.  This way she will be able to continue growing with her business.  This way she will give her family what they need to have a life without deprivations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":1355879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy drinks, candy, baked goods, and the rest.

","en":"Esther is a widow, and she has 4 adult children.  She has been working as a merchant for 7 years.  She started her business selling a variety of merchandise so that she could get ahead through her own efforts.  She sells products such as clothing and undergarments, cosmetics, and perfumes.  She sells on cash and credit to her friends, relatives, and neighbors, who have become her best customers.  Many of them pay her gradually over time, according to their ability, for the items that they purchase in the business, where they find a glass display case stocked with items to choose from.  \r\n\r\nEsther has taken 2 loans with the  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With these loans, she has managed to grow in her market, with increased credibility and a good inventory that enables her to fill her orders in a timely manner.  She now buys from another merchant, and she wants to make her purchases in bulk and at a better price.  For this reason, she has applied for a Kiva loan.  She will use the loan to buy toiletries, makeup and shoes that her customers have ordered.

He is 41 years old, married, and he has a family.  He has been working in carpentry for more than 10 years.  He does not own a lot of equipment to work on construction sites.  He therefore has to rent equipment, which is very costly.

Zarina's husband provides taxi services.\r\n\r\nZarina sews traditional Tajik dresses from home. She and her husband jointly provide for the family.  Zarina is a dynamic and responsible woman.  As her children are growing and expenses are now exceeding the family's income, she has been thinking about opening her own grocery store for a few months already.\r\n\r\nA month ago, Zarina purchased a retail outlet.  She has also bought a refrigerator and ordered shelves.  She has some money, but not enough to open her shop.  This is why she has turned to MLO HUMO to get a loan to buy food products.  In the district where she will be opening her shop, the demand for food products is good, and there are already various grocery stores.  She knows that, in the beginning, things will be difficult for her, because she has never worked in this area and because she does not have regular customers yet.  But she has set her goals, she has invested all her savings, and she is very interested in this business.\r\n\r\nZarina thanks all of you for your support!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1147.2,"image":{"id":1352021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products in order to open a grocery store and increase her family's capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T05:10:03Z","loan_amount":2950,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2940,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":163.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":164.02,"local_amount":163.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381765869,"comment":null},{"amount":163.75,"local_amount":163.2,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":163.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390628937,"comment":null},{"amount":163.89,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":163.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399873133,"comment":null},{"amount":163.88,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":163.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410149868,"comment":null},{"amount":163.89,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":163.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419913029,"comment":null},{"amount":163.88,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":163.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561133,"comment":null},{"amount":163.89,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":163.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T10:58:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":561808,"name":"Dilrabo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A beautiful woman by the name of Dilrabo lives in a flat that is in bad condition.

Ghazala is a 42-year-old married woman and mother of seven children. She had a difficult time after her husband's business failure, so she decided to work to initiate her own business to support her family for a better future. \r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago, she began a business of football manufacturing in her house. Over time, she has become famous in her town for providing good quality footballs and earns enough to bear the expenses of her family members.

Asma is a 26-year-old married woman. She had a difficult time after her husband's business failure, so she decided to initiate her own business of a general store to support her family for a better future. She has gained two years of experience in this field, and has attained a regular list of customers.

Shameem is a 50-year-old vigorous lady and a mother of six children. She deals in making and supplying bags and sacks which are used to store cotton and crushed wheat. She has gained 12 years of experience in this field. She stitches bags for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. \r\n\r\nHowever, due to lack of availability of funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers.

Perveen is a 53-year-old married woman who is doing a business of milk sales for the past 16 years. She has one buffalo in milk; she sells its milk to many of her neighbors. Her business is good enough to give her decent life. She has two children; one of them is school going.

She sells palm oil and gari. She has been running this business for 15 years. She works in the business for nine hours per day, seven days per week. She says that her major hardship is cost of transportation, which is very expensive from her operation area to her house, and competition in the market. \r\n\r\nKannah has requested a loan in order to buy more palm oil and gari for resale.

is 45 years old. He lives in Ochkhamuri village, Kobuleti district with his 42-year-old wife, four children and retired mother. Israil requested loan from the local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nIsrail has a car. He drives it as a taxi to transport local people and earns small daily income, which is the main source of living for the family. Their additional income is Israil\u2019s mother\u2019s monthly pension. He is very hard working man and works long hours to earn good income, but it\u2019s still not enough to feed his seven-member family.\r\n\r\nHe requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Israil has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re- start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Israil will install gas equipment in his car.

She was unable to go to school, but she is business-minded. For the past twelve years, she has been selling dry fish from a table in the local market. She likes her business because of the ways customers buy from her. She started this business with money given to her by husband. She walks every day to buy her goods since her table is much closer to the local wholesale area. She is requesting a loan to purchase more dry fish for her business. She plans to buy a piece of land and build a house. She likes to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC

He is a very kind, hard-working, enthusiastic person who has a great desire to get ahead.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources and the need to work to help his parents, Yerson was unable to get a professional mechanic's degree as he would have liked.  In his free time he enjoys watching films and sometimes he cooks delicious pork cracklings to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Yerson works selling construction materials at a hardware store in his city.

is 40-year-old Jusu. He is married and has two children 14 and 18 years old. He has no additional dependents living with him.\r\nIn 1997, Jusu established his tailoring business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 700,000 (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000 in order to buy more tailoring materials. Jusu has been unable to buy a piece of land where he intends to build a house.

is a Ghanaian artisan who specializes in handcrafted jewelry with traditional beads. She would like to invest in the purchase of larger quantities of stone, silver, wood and bone beads. Since these beads come from Cameroon, Abidjan, and Mali, she can get a better price by purchasing larger amounts.\r\n\r\nTina has been selling through NOVICA since 2001. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I am a descendant of the Ga Mashie royal family, and when I was just three weeks old my father died. I wanted to be a teacher, but to cope with difficult financial times I taught reading classes while I trained in auto spraying. I also worked at a textiles company during the week and at the weekends I made beaded jewelry for personal customers and to sell at street markets. I've always been interested in working with underprivileged children, as I too suffered many hardships as a child. I started a program called 'Children In Need' in 1996, and I started teaching them our traditional bead making crafts.

and her husband Francisco are Guatemalan artisans who organized a foundation in memory of their daughter, where young people with disabilities could learn to create handicrafts. They would like to purchase materials such as paper, glue and beads to continue their work.\r\n\r\nArgentina and Francisco have been selling through NOVICA since 2010. This is their story:\r\n\r\n\"Our daughter Nyla Eliza was born with hydrocephaly. She underwent several operations and as a result contracted meningitis, which left huge side effects and multiple disabilities. She passed away when she was 10 years old. In 1998 we founded Asociacion ADISA in her honor. What first began as a support group for parents and children with special needs has now become an association that provides education so that children can join mainstream schools. Youngsters adore making recycled paper crafts so they may eventually have a craft when they are too old to attend ADISA.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to this micro-credit, we will be able to continue giving job training and work to disabled young people. Your generosity will help our project to continue growing and we are very grateful for your assistance.

She accepted, and that was how her business started. Today she sells clothes, footwear, bags and other items for women. She has not stopped working since 2009, when she began. Her day starts at 8 in the morning and continues until 7 at night, Monday to Sunday.\r\n\r\nHer customer base has exceeded expectations, but also it has exceeded her capacity to meet orders.

She is married and has two children who are 11 and 4 years old. She has one additional dependent living with her. In 2008, Isatu established her provisions, school uniform, slippers, and foodstuff business. She began her business because she wanted to raise funds to pay her school fees to further her education. Working seven days a week and six hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,200,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Isatu requires a loan in order to buy more provisions, uniform materials, and slippers for her business. Isatu used the proceeds from her last loan to help her husband complete the dwelling house for their family.

Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 900,000 every month from this business.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Mary now requires this loan in order to buy different types of drinks to meet the needs of her customers. Mary has not opened any new business outlets because she was not able to secure a place to do so.

She has a shop where she sells diverse merchandise and also dedicates part of her mornings to preparing and selling lunches. Both businesses generate income with has every day generated a greater wellbeing for her home. Her life as businesswoman started six years ago, selling products through specialized guides. Her business has been gradually growing and, as a result, she has attached glass cases where she can exhibit her products.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, she sells sweets, cellular minutes, which constitute other income, taking advantage of her captive customers who visit her daily. She makes her sales with cash and credit, studying her customers well. She acquires the sweet and the ingredients to prepare the lunches in the center of the city of Barranquilla with cash. Meanwhile, the merchandise that she offers from catalogs she acquires with credit. Her goal for the future is to build a bigger sized shop where only her business operates. But her great challenge is to have enough cash to fund the expansion of her business, respond to her customers and to always have her shop well stocked. Nidian is applying for her second credit with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With her previous loan, she was able to buy catalog cosmetic products, sweets, and ingredients in large volumes to produce more food. Also, she acquired three glass cases and four tables with which she could exhibit her merchandise better to impact the customers' desire to buy. Her success in this investment lies in her experience and also her purchase is a response to her customers' requests and to the current rotation of her products. Today, she has approached the Foundation to request a CrediKiva with which she will buy a refrigerator and a photocopier. She is thankful to Kiva and to the Foundation for helping her get ahead and she is happy for the support provided."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":328.28,"image":{"id":1356066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a refrigerator and a photocopier.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T12:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T12:40:09Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nidian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70658},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":101395},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":103761},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":106182},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":108660},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":111195},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":113790},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":116445},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":119162},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":121942},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":124788},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":127699},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":130679},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133728},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":136849},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":140042},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":143309},{"due_date":"2014-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":189716}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.39},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.54,"local_amount":70658,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":70895.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968280,"comment":null},{"amount":55.31,"local_amount":101395,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101735.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817462,"comment":null},{"amount":56.59,"local_amount":103761,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":104109.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323737,"comment":null},{"amount":57.92,"local_amount":106182,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":106538.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082967,"comment":null},{"amount":59.27,"local_amount":108660,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":109025.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062326,"comment":null},{"amount":60.65,"local_amount":111195,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":111568.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T14:48:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562129,"name":"Hoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoa is a 51-year-old married man living in Ho Chi Minh City.

Therefore, she decided to apply for a loan of 70,000 YER to expand her business and include different and new kinds of foods and soft drinks. \r\n\r\nShe looks forward to opening a small grocery store in the near future instead of selling in the street because that would attract more customers, which in turn, would result in improving her income and helping the family go over the poverty line.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700.21,"image":{"id":1355388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to expand her business and include different and new kinds of foods and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Habiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aziza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Warda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":210000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":21135},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20985},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20985}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":200.57,"local_amount":42120,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":43052.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381616364,"comment":null},{"amount":199.86,"local_amount":41970,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42899.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400176146,"comment":null},{"amount":99.93,"local_amount":20985,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":21449.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419763664,"comment":null},{"amount":99.93,"local_amount":20985,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21449.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429413720,"comment":null},{"amount":99.92,"local_amount":20985,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":21449.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439631709,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T16:20:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562253,"name":"Saja","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saja is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in the picture taken in their new house in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nSaja is a 21-year-old young married woman with one son and one daughter.

If he does not deal with these issues on time, he is not able to work peacefully.

She and her husband built their own house on a plot of land. Her daughter lives separately from her parents, on her own. She has been working as an attendant at a private business entity since 2011. Her husband renders transportation service between Ulaanbaatar and other cities. The house they live in is vulnerable to heat loss and to strong storms, due to a deteriorated and weak curb roof. So she is applying for a loan of 2,400,000 MNT to buy planks, fiberglass and cement. Using these materials, her husband can repair the curb roof of the house, thus stopping the loss of heat through the roof. Stopping heat loss will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to the efforts to combat air pollution. The borrower is a very hard-working individual who strives for a better future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":538.22,"image":{"id":1355549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy planks, cement and fiberglass to repair their roof.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":25.61,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tserendolgor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":118080},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108670.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":105845.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":116039.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117264.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":117134.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":124846.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":125225},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":128589.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135523.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135685.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":138405.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":144658.9},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147615.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":150350},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":155362.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":159401.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":171302.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.02},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.25},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.41,"local_amount":118080,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":118093.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381690610,"comment":null},{"amount":75.84,"local_amount":108670.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108682.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390553384,"comment":null},{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":105845.1,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105857.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.46,"payment_id":399802395,"comment":null},{"amount":77.16,"local_amount":116039.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":116052.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.83,"payment_id":410078419,"comment":null},{"amount":75.11,"local_amount":117264.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":117277.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.73,"payment_id":419844859,"comment":null},{"amount":77.16,"local_amount":117134.3,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":117147.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.59,"payment_id":429493771,"comment":null},{"amount":82.13,"local_amount":124846.9,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":124861.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5,"payment_id":439717907,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T19:54:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562264,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angelina is a 59-year-old mother who owns and manages a small variety store in her village.

His wife has retired and receives a state pension. His son works as a general engineer at another building company. His work time is short, so he decided to grow vegetables as a food source and for sale. So he is applying for a loan of 6,000,000 MNT to buy necessary items, such as a shovel, pipe for watering, and seeds. Those materials are needed urgently, because the appropriate season for growing vegetables is here, and any delay will result in a poor harvest.

She is unmarried and lives with her parents and siblings in their own house. Katherine works selling timber: slats, boards and other pieces for walls and floors. She purchases all of the wood from sawmills and sells it from the same place. She also sells from home where she has an area equipped for this purpose. However, she is usually able to sell everything at the sawmill. She tends to her customers in a friendly way, and this has earned her the preference of each and everyone one of them. Thanks to this, they recommend her to others.\r\n\r\nShe began this business 3 years ago with her own capital. She sold in small quantities and soon increased her sales due to a high demand for the product.  She considers her business to be quite profitable due to the income that it generates for her and also because of the good reception it has received. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion she requests 2000 Peruvian Nuevo Soles.

It was from her mother that she learned her skills, watching her since she was a little girl.  Now mother and daughter support each other as they both sew school uniforms and sports kits.  In addition, they also sell products through specialized company catalogs which makes them extra income.  Their daily tasks begin at 7.00am and they work, without stopping, until 6.00pm.  They buy raw materials and supplies, design, cut, repair, sew, finish off the garments, then sell them.  They make their purchases with cash and their sales are on credit though some are for cash.  \r\n\r\nCatherine is currently applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy raw materials and supplies such as fabric, threads and accessories because she has an order for some sheets that she needs to fill.

She is the mother of three children, who are 24, 21 and 16 years old, and her children live with her in her own home.  Lina's business is designing and making clothing.  She also repairs clothing that her customers bring to her, restoring them to a perfect condition. Lina has a small workshop in her home and she has been doing this work for 18 years.  It has allowed her to feed her family and provide her children with a good education.  Lina works alone and is very happy because her business is going well even though her number of customers decreases at certain times of year.\r\n\r\nWhen she started sewing for a living, Lina experienced a number of problems stemming from a lack of experience such as inaccurately cutting her fabric or not picking the right fabric for each garment.  However, she learned from experience and also from the training that she sought out and received to improve her skills.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Lina is requesting a loan for 3,000 soles.  She is very grateful to be receiving this financial support and pledges to make her repayments on time.  She will use the sum she has requested to buy materials so that she can continue working.

The idea was a great success and they still make these beautiful items today, especially 'guayabera' shirts (a delicately embroidered, loose-fitting men's shirt made from lightweight material which is not worn tucked in).  Her main customers are friends and neighbors but she also has buyers who she has reached through the Internet and who she sells to for cash.  \r\n\r\nDennys is currently applying for a Kiva loan (her 12th loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy fabric for making her shirts.

When his harvests are in he takes them to be sold in the market in Managua because he\u2019s paid well for the grains there.  Francisco also sells the cheese made from milk his cattle produces.\r\n\r\nToday, Francisco is requesting a loan to buy fertilizer and manure and to pay labor costs for his corn and bean crops.  Francisco says that the loan will help him do all the work required to plant corn and beans.  He says that once he repays the loan with income from the harvest he will use any left over money to make improvements to the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1356231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farm supplies and pay labor costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-22T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-21T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":408.23,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":408.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":408.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T20:58:55Z","paid_date":"2013-10-22T08:48:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562683,"name":"Amparo Justina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Amparo, una se\u00f1ora que ha procreado 8 hijos, lo cual no ha sido nada f\u00e1cil darles la alimentaci\u00f3n, educaci\u00f3n y muchas otras  cosas primordiales en la vida, pero como es trabajadora y con la ayuda de su esposo ha logrado salir adelante, hoy en d\u00eda casi todos son independientes a excepci\u00f3n de dos que todav\u00eda son adolecentes y est\u00e1n a su cargo, su medio de ganarse la vida continua siendo una peque\u00f1a pulper\u00eda, ella busca como mejorar las condiciones de su hogar por lo que solicita este 4to cr\u00e9dito para reparar techo y continuar la construcci\u00f3n de un cuarto que ya hab\u00eda empezado y espera con este financiamiento poder avanzar lo m\u00e1s que pueda ya que le hacen falta paredes ventanas entre otros.

Meteda can be found in local markets around his hometown, Sentani, promoting Nazava Water Filters.\n\nMeteda wants to expand to more local markets, plus begin doing demonstrations at local offices. Meteda will use this loan to buy more Nazava water filters on credit.

She lives with her ailing husband and four kids. Her husband is suffering from a prolapsed disc thus he cannot move freely.\r\n\r\nNgailam sell toys in the town market shed and she makes a very good profit. Her sales includes toys for girls and boys whose age ranges from 3-13 yrs. She sells dolls, kitchen wares, dressing kits, doctors kits etc. for girls and plastic guns, pistols, water pistols, paint guns and GI Joes for boys. She makes a good income because there are very few vendors for toy shops. Kids like to purchase new toys and play with them thus it is essential for her to refill her shop with more interesting toys to attract kids. Her sales increase during the summer and winter breaks because kids are on vacation. Therefore, she keeps track of the school breaks and makes sure she has what the kids want in her toy shop.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva Loan she will purchase more variations of toys for both boys and girls. She is planning to purchase and sell Barbie dolls, stuffed toys, war tanks, remote access toys and super heroes masks. She always wanted to keep these toys in her shop but her income was small. She also takes care of her ailing husband who needs a monthly routine check-up in which she spends a lot on medication. She is glad that Kiva will assist her financially in bringing growth to her business and allowing her to sell better and attractive toys.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to save money and give surgery in a well-reputed private hospital in the state capital. She thanks WSDS and Kiva for the love and support towards herself and the Chikim B Group. The rest of the group members are also engaged in poultry, weaving, piggery, and grocery.

The traditional work of this community is cobbler (making, repairing and polishing of different leather products). Normally this work is done by the male members. They formed a joint liability group named Hara Gouri. One of them is Surekha. The lady sitting second from the right with raised hand in the photo is Surekha. Surekha is 33 years old; living with her husband and three sons aged 16, 14 and 11. All three of the children are attending normal school. \r\n\r\nSurekha herself has been selling vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, brinjal, ladies finger etc., and seasonal fruits like mangos in the daily market of the town for the last 15 years. She brings stock from the local wholesalers. There was always some left-over stock that was not sold which had to be thrown away as they did not have a storage space of their own. So, Surekha decided to start selling these vegetables on her own by the roadside in the market. She now wants to rent a shop that will help her to have a place to sell the vegetables. It will also help her to buy more stock for starting a wholesale business. Buying more stock will help reduce her frequent travel to the market and eventually transportation and buying costs. A portion of the loan amount will help her to rent a shop in the market and purchase more stock of vegetables and fruits. Surekha hopes to complete the construction of her half-built house as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group are Chanchala, Sabita, Kumudini, Gouri and Premsila doing same business of vegetable vending.

She sells electrical goods like bulbs, wire, tube lights, frames, holders etc. Bimala was able to increase the variety of items at her electrical shop with the previous two loans from Mahashakti Foundation and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is 6,000 Rupees. Out of this small income she is hardly managing her household expenses. \r\n\r\nAs per the statement of Bimala she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase stock of her business. This is the third loan for Bimala and from this loan amount she is planning to purchase electrical items like bulbs, tube lights, frames, holders, sockets etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock frequently. Bimala hopes to save enough for building a permanent house.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Pazil will purchase calves.

is married and a mother of two children who are of school-going age. They reside in the Nkubu, Meru region of Eastern Kenya. She has been a farmer for over 10 years, growing and selling cereals. Besides farming, she has a retail business for more income generation.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve her farming, Catherine requested a loan of KES 30,000 so that she can purchase water pipes for an efficient supply of water to her farm. The challenges she faces are insufficient funds and crop pests.

Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php,50,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Elma dreams of having another branch and hopes to have another source of income.
