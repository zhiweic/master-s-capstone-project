She separated from the father of her children after many years together and now lives with her children, 23-, 21- and 12-years old, respectively, in a house that she bought with her ex-partner.\r\n\r\nJacinta operates a meat sales business.  She has a food stand that she sets up in her front yard where she can meet her customers.  She buys live chickens from her brother's farm, chickens that her brother sells to her at a discounted rate.  The business is the only one of its kind in the neighborhood and has steadily grown as more and more of her neighbors have come to buy her chickens.  She has operated the business for 7 years and spends much of her day tending it.  She relies on her children who often help her with everything from buying and preparing the chickens to selling them.  For the future, she wants to build on the business by opening a grocery.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 4th MFP loan.  She says that she is grateful for your help and confidence because the loan will help her meet her goals.  She says, too, that she is committed to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time and that she is happy with her community bank because she considers its members to be responsible and supportive.\r\nJacinta will use part of this 2500 new soles loan to buy more chickens for her meat business and the rest to buy merchandise (rice, sugar, milk, eggs, cooking oil, bread, flour, soft drinks, snacks, fruits, vegetables) to start a grocery

is Angela, 59, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. A widow, she is a mother to her children. She manages her own household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nAngela operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She makes profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also has a direct selling business for her customers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nAngela hopes to expand her business and to have a bigger stall. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1157437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

The electronic data capture is a machine that helps Ibu Siti to create payment\/buying transactions in her shop. \r\n\r\nA payment point like Ibu Siti's is needed in her neighbourhood because it is really hard to access banks and ATMs, the electricity hub, water company or post office as they are far away. It will cost more money and is time consuming for people to go to there. Therefore, by having this new service product, she hopes it will make it easier for people to pay bills and reach the target of transactions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1157465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for a deposit on an electronic data capture (EDC) machine for her bill payment business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Cilegon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":3000000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-02T09:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3071250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T03:55:57Z","paid_date":"2013-04-02T09:29:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":456972,"name":"Chinyavu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A 28-year-old young lady, Ms. Chinyavu is married to a businessman and the mother of a 7-year-old son.

This activity has made it possible for him to generate income needed to cover basic household expenses.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he has time available to do his other work which is growing bananas, corn, manioc, tropical chilies and others according to the season.  What he likes about this is that he\u2019s learned through experience how the plants behave according to weather conditions and this gives him much satisfaction.  He also likes to be able to generate profits for his home through his grocery sales.  Prior to starting these businesses he worked for others and his profits were small; this was one of the motivating factors that pushed him to become independent and now he does much better and feels he\u2019s on the right path towards progress.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #17 and he\u2019s very grateful to know that he\u2019ll have financial support and commits once again to make his installment payments punctually like he\u2019s done in previous loans.  He\u2019s also very happy to be part of his communal bank because all its members are very responsible and mutually supportive.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1000 soles to buy certified corn seeds to start to plant and will also buy sacks of rice and sugar to continue selling in his grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn seeds and also to buy sacks of rice and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":162.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456508,"comment":null},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":160.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452169,"comment":null},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":174.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447345,"comment":null},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":175.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053245,"comment":null},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":187.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188178,"comment":null},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":193.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572069,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-21T17:06:12Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":455788,"name":"Ositos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo los Ositos lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es \u00c1ngela del Socorro quien tiene una pulper\u00eda desde hace 5 a\u00f1os.

She\u2019s single but has a little boy who is the result of her relationship with her ex-spouse.  She lives in her own house with her parents, siblings and her son.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling traditional regional food and other daily consumption dishes.  Her work day starts very early with the purchase of ingredients needed for food preparation.  She sells all day from breakfast to lunch and some evening dishes.  Her food stand is located on the path alongside her house and she\u2019s always in constant activity.  She\u2019s been in business 7 years and her mother and sister help her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it produces income she can use to help her family cover household expenses and above all because it allows her to provide her son with everything he needs.  She\u2019s had many economic needs for a long time because of the lack of employment or because of businesses that produced neither much satisfaction nor peace of mind.  But now she feels more at ease because she has an occupation she\u2019s passionate about and that has helped her quite a bit.  She now plans to rent a locale and enlarge her business so that she can tend to customer with more comfort.\r\n\r\nThis is her first MFP loan.  She thanks all the people who make her loan possible in order to continue working towards making her plans a reality.  She commits to being a punctual member and to make her installment payments responsibly.  She affirms that she feels at ease with and grateful to her loan officer for all the training and advice she\u2019s gotten to start on this new path.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 700 new soles to buy ingredients and supplies like rice, oil, condiments, sugar, spices, vegetables and tubers to prepare her dishes; she spends about 150 soles per day.  She will also buy some utensils in order to provide better customer service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1154261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":120.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":122.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":128.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.01,"local_amount":106.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":110.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456509,"comment":null},{"amount":41.74,"local_amount":106.24,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":109.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452170,"comment":null},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":115.83,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":119.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447346,"comment":null},{"amount":47.21,"local_amount":120.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":124.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053246,"comment":null},{"amount":48.02,"local_amount":122.25,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":126.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188179,"comment":null},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":128.59,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":133.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572070,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T03:36:25Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":455800,"name":"Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR DE TETE CACA \u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en la  provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

The process will take several years, since it must be done in phases, and he will receive training from Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco in order to do it. \r\nHis last harvest yielded eight tons, and he is hoping to reach ten tons next season, three of which will be organic coffee beans, since he previously sowed plants which had been treated for this purpose. \r\nJaime's greatest dream is being able to build his own coffee brokerage so that he can process all of his output himself, although he also has plans to improve his sugar mill."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1154762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to switch from conventional coffee production to organic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":868.7,"local_amount":11582.73,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":11643.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355936712,"comment":null},{"amount":31.3,"local_amount":417.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":419.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810651,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T15:24:02Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":456919,"name":"Phan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phan is 38 years old.

Para cumplir con su trabajo instala todos los d\u00edas un \u201ccarrito sanguchero\u201d en la puerta de su casa donde fr\u00ede las papas, el pollo y otros insumos que caracterizan este platillo.

She has lived with Francisco who works as a day laborer for many years and they have five children who are 19, 18, 9, 7 and 4 years of age.\r\n\r\nHer activity is selling fast-food like \u201csalchipapa\u201d (fried sausage with fried potatoes), hamburgers and others.  To do her work she sets up her food cart every day at her doorstep where she fries potatoes, chicken and other ingredients characteristic of this dish.  She also sets up a pair of tables and chairs where she tends to her walk-in customers.\r\n\r\nHer work starts very early shopping for necessary ingredients and in the afternoon she prepares everything at home and the selling starts at 5pm.  \r\nFortunately, her house is located on a very busy corner on her town\u2019s main street.  She\u2019s been in business two years and her older children help her.  \r\nThe only problem is having to set up and take down the stand every day which is why noting that her work is generating profits and with support from her spouse she\u2019s planning on renting a locale where she can have everything set up permanently and ready to provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth MFP loan and she thanks the people who make it possible for her to access credit.  She commits to making all her installment payments punctually like she did with previous loans.

It was his parents who taught him how to grow coffee.  As the years passed he was acquiring a lot of experience.  He currently receives training from the Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco to be able to take maximum advantage of the land and resources that he has.\r\n\r\nThe coffee that \u00darsulo produces is conventional, and he wants to convert all of his plants to organic coffee.  He wants to do this because organic coffee does not use chemical fertilizers, and it has a greater market value.  During the last harvest he had a production of six tons.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue producing at this level he needs to buy coffee plants to renew the old ones.  That is why he is requesting a loan.  In addition to growing coffee, on the week-ends \u00darsulo sells pork in order to have an extra income.  He mostly does this during the times when the coffee is barely giving fruit.\r\n\r\n\u00darsulo and his wife, Obdulia, have as one of their biggest dreams giving their three children a university education.  They know that working as they have been up until now will make this be possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1154774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to convert his conventional coffee production to organic coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u00darsulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":15078.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810652,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T02:43:38Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":458109,"name":"Clotilde","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Clotilde est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de quatre enfants dont trois vont encore \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 35,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMichelle hopes to grow her business and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Actualmente vive solo en una humilde casa que ha podido edificar con el resultado de su esfuerzo.\nSu negocio es la venta de frutas. Su labor empieza con la compra, al por mayor, de frutas regionales, principalmente naranjas y sand\u00eda; luego las pela y las coloca en envases, al natural o en jugos. Lo hace ambulatoriamente y tambi\u00e9n se coloca en un establecimiento fijo. Viene realizando este negocio desde hace 15 a\u00f1os y siempre le ha ido muy bien. La experiencia que ha logrado con el paso del tiempo le ha permitido consolidar una amplia clientela y eso se ve reflejado en que a diario termina todo lo que tiene. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es que tiene tiempo para poder realizar algunas otras actividades en su casa y dedicar, eventualmente, su tiempo libre a realizar trabajos de carpinter\u00eda o alba\u00f1iler\u00eda. Lo que no le gusta es que a veces tiene que irse muy temprano al mercado para poder realizar la compra de sus productos.

He has six adult children and currently lives alone in a humble home that he was able to build though his efforts.\r\n\r\nHis business is selling fruit.  His work begins with him buying regional fruits in quantity, mainly oranges and watermelons.  He then peals the fruit and packages it up as fruit or juice.  He does this on foot and also sets up in a shop.  He has been doing this for 15 years and things have always gone well for him.  He has been able to consolidate his wide customer base and this shows because he sells out every day.  What he likes most about his work is that he is able to do other things in his home and use his spare time to do other jobs such as carpentry or masonry.  What he doesn\u2019t like is that at times he must go to the market early in the morning to be able to buy his products.  He expects to continue working so that he can continue saving up so that he can have a peaceful old age in a business where he can work from home.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 18th loan through MFP and he appreciates those who make possible for him to continue with his objectives.  On the other hand he is very committed to making his payments on time, as he has been doing in the past.  He is very glad to belong to his communal bank because the other members are good, friendly, and united.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan (1,000 PEN) to buy oranges, mandarin oranges, watermelons, and grapes by the crate so that he can continue selling them.  His daily investment is between 300 PEN and 500 PEN, depending on the season and the quality of the fruit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"buy fruit for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456513,"comment":null},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452174,"comment":null},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":173.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447350,"comment":null},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053250,"comment":null},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":186.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188183,"comment":null},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572074,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T20:32:55Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457014,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a hardworking farmer, blessed with three children who are in school.

Her principal function is to administer this business, settling all the accounts and giving her workers everything they need.

He is single but has one daughter who's eight years whom he cares for and visits periodically.\r\n\r\nHis work is transporting passengers. He works inside the city and its outskirts. He spends his days driving his taxi and it doesn't matter whether it's daytime or nighttime- he works with energy and always carries a smile to give to his occasional passengers. Due to having these qualities he is always requested to fulfill this function. He's been doing this work for four years and owns his own car. He was able to buy it from a friend who was going to throw it away. He knows the city's streets very well and always provides fast service. At the beginning things were complicated for him since it was difficult to have to drive for so many hours and he was not getting used to the routine. But, when he began to see this job as profitable, he had to adapt to the working rhythm and fortunately managed to do so.

This loan will be used to pay the guarantee money for this machine.\r\n \r\nAs a Loket Ruma Agent, Mugi will become a payment point, where customers can come to his stall and pay their monthly bills or buy an electricity voucher. He expects that most of his customers will come to him to pay their electricity bill, buy an electricity voucher and pay motorcycle installments. By becoming the payment point, Mugi helps the neighbor to access the banking system, since going to the nearest banks & ATMs are time consuming and have higher costs. In the end, having the Loket Ruma product is adding more business to his current stall.

She lives with her spouse, the father of their six-year-old son.\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is selling automobile spare parts and lubricants.  She rises very early every day to do her household chores and when she finishes them she heads out to her store located in a strategic, central spot in the city.  She\u2019s been doing this work for six years and has learned that customers must always be treated courteously and their needs must be met which is why when she does not have some spare part a customer needs on hand she immediately goes to the establishment next door to get it because she does not want to lose any of the customers she worked so hard to secure.\r\n\r\nHer only help in her shop is her spouse who takes care of the mechanical part of the vehicles while she sells and offers the spare parts.  Her goal is to have a locale of her own since the current one is leased; she hopes to accomplish this in the short run.\r\n\r\nThis is her third MFP loan.  She thanks those who make the loan possible for her to continue towards her objectives.  On the other hand, she\u2019s most committed to once again make her payments punctually like she did with previous loans.  She\u2019s very happy to belong to her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1000 soles to buy oil, lubricants and some spare parts to continue with sales in her shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"  to buy oil, lubricant and spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.97},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":183.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":154.17,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":161.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456524,"comment":null},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":151.88,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452185,"comment":null},{"amount":66.23,"local_amount":165.58,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":173.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447361,"comment":null},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":166.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053261,"comment":null},{"amount":71.19,"local_amount":177.97,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":186.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188194,"comment":null},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":183.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":192.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T19:13:12Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":457010,"name":"Jennilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennilyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who earns an income by buying and selling meat and frozen products.

He is a very responsible and hardworking man. He has lived in a common law relationship with his partner for the past 40 years and they have six children who are all now adults. Now he lives with his wife in his own house and it is with her that he passes his days.\r\n\r\nHe dedicates himself to cultivating and harvesting the oil palm. He leaves for his fields very early, where he inspects his plants\u2019 growth and tries to keep his cultivated area well weeded. He has been engaged in this work for the past 20 years and it has allowed him to be economically viable as well as providing him the opportunity to support his children for many of their expenses.  He works alone, however occasionally his sons help him which enables him to save money that he could eventually use to contract a labor force. He owns a van that he uses to transport his entire crop to the place where he sells it. \r\n\r\nJuvencio complements this business by working as a laborer constructing residential buildings. In addition, he also works as a wood operator when the opportunity presents itself. What he likes about his main line of work is that it provides him the necessary time to engage in other activities. His farming is going well because, similar to other agriculturalists in the sector who work with the oil palm, he sells his products at a good price to a palm oil business that is located a few kilometers from his farm.

She has a cart, or trailer, that she has set up to sell hot-dogs and hamburgers, and she does this work every day from 5:30pm until 9pm in front of her house.  She also has a bicycle set up to sell tacos, and she uses this to sell at a school that is located a kilometer from her house from Mondays through Fridays from 9 to 10am.  She buys all of the products that she sells in her store, including those that she uses to make fast food, from shopping centers in the city located 5 kilometers from her house.  She transports these products using public transportation.  \r\n\r\nMaria is requesting a loan to build a shed and to put cement on the floor so that she can start a business selling tortillas and pay off a loan that she has from another institution.  With this investment, she will set up her sales post to start a new business (selling tortillas) and will make an improvement to the roof in the place where she sells to her hot-dog and hamburger customers.  In addition, she will pay off another loan, which will allow her to improve her financial situation.   Among her goals are: expanding her business, teaching her children how to run the business, and creating sufficient capital to invest in the purchase of a big house for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1154911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

He has been working since 1994 nonstop and has become one of the skillful specialists at the electric power plant. \r\n\r\nHe lives with his wife and son in the city. His family owns an old apartment with two rooms.  They have been living there since 1994; before that, he used to live with his parents. \r\n\r\nSince 1998 he has not made any repairs or renovations to his home, and now it is old and rundown.  In winter it becomes too cold to live in because of the heat loss through the door and window of the living room.  In response, sometimes he uses a coal stove to heat his home. His son Tuvshinbayar, who is 14, always has a flu and cold every winter. \r\n\r\nSo he decided to repair his apartment.  At first he will enclose the balcony by the installing shelter. He hopes it will reduce the heat loss through the window of the living room and the need to use the toxic coal fuel.

is Toufic, a Lebanese single man. He\u2019s 25 years old. From childhood until now, Toufic has lived with his parents, as well as his three siblings, one of whom is working. His father is the one responsible for covering their costs and expenses. However, Toufic doesn\u2019t hesitate to give help whenever needed. This is why he decided to start his own business. He opened his own laptop and mobile phone shop in 2009.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"I have always loved handicrafts. When I was 17, I started my own ceramic workshop, but I changed direction and began to work in wrought iron and blown glass. I experimented with sheets of iron to give my works more movement. We cut the metal sheets, hammer them into shape and weld them before treating to retard rust. Every piece created at my workshop goes hand in hand with originality, design and quality. We are always developing new designs and products.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you you for your interest in assisting us artisans, for our only desire is to work and provide for our families in a dignified manner.

Her short-term aim is to grow her business and, eventually, she would either like to open another restaurant or focus on selling alcohol, as running a restaurant means that she is forced to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning every day, which is early for someone of advancing age."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1160445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food

This income will put him in a better position to ensure his children's education. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1160455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy spare parts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Douala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-08-07T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-06T11:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"F\u00e9lix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10401},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10782},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11165},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11545},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":11927},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12310},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12691},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13072},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13455},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13836},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14218},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14598}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.38},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.8,"local_amount":10401,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":11008.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072075,"comment":null},{"amount":21.57,"local_amount":10782,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":11411.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306472,"comment":null},{"amount":22.33,"local_amount":11165,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":11816.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914812,"comment":null},{"amount":23.09,"local_amount":11545,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12218.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047051,"comment":null},{"amount":23.85,"local_amount":11927,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12623.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436846,"comment":null},{"amount":24.62,"local_amount":12310,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":13028.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989265,"comment":null},{"amount":25.38,"local_amount":12691,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":13431.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622882,"comment":null},{"amount":26.15,"local_amount":13072,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":13834.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437038,"comment":null},{"amount":26.91,"local_amount":13455,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":14240.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842110,"comment":null},{"amount":85.3,"local_amount":42652,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":45141.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610126,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T16:09:00Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T08:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":455078,"name":"Annet's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annet's group is comprised of three hardworking women.

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is married and has 3 children with 2 of them currently in school. For the past 4 years, Jauahara has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities like dry beans, sugar, and maize flour. \n\nTo help expand her business, Jauahara has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like maize flour, dry beans, and sugar for resale, and will help Jauahara to generate greater profits and save her profits and add some to the business capital. Jauahara hopes that in the future she will be able to own a boutique. \n\nJauahara is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

Gorret is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is married and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Gorret has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells fresh food like \"matooke\" (green bananas). \n\nTo help expand her business, Gorret has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food for resale, and will help Gorret to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Gorret hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \n\nGorret is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is single and has two children with one of them currently in school. For the past three years, Hajarah has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells charcoal. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hajarah has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more charcoal for resale, and will help Hajarah to generate greater profits and pay for the rent where she has the business. Hajarah hopes that in the future she will be able to own a clothing business. \n\nHajarah is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Hajarah's future prospects by helping her own a big retail shop in town.

The loan will be used to purchase more fresh foods and tomatoes for resale and will help Cissy to generate greater profits and pay rent for the business. Cissy hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \n\nCissy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

is 20 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past two years, Justine has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells essential commodities like dry beans, sugar, and maize flour. \n\nTo help expand her business, Justine has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities like maize flour, dry beans and sugar for resale. This will help Justine to generate greater profits and pay rent were she has the business. Justine hopes that in the future she will be able to start a chicken business. \n\nJustine is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Hasifa is 18 years old and lives in the town of Bulenga in the Kampala west region of Uganda. For the past year, Hasifa has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells chicken. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hasifa has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chicken feed and more chicken birds for resale. It will also help Hasifa to generate greater profits and save her money so as to buy domestic animals in the future for resale. Hasifa hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \n\nHasifa is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 30 years old and lives with his wife and daughter.

Together with her partner she has three children ages 18, 15, and the last is two months old. They live together in the home they built through years of hard work, effort, and savings.\r\n\r\nShe works selling groceries and basic necessities. Every day, starting very early, she opens the doors of her store to attend to her customers who come all the way to her store with the confidence that there they will find what they need. Her shop is the most well stocked in her neighborhood, and her clients never hesitate to buy from her, not only for that reason but also because of the quality of the brands that she offers and her cordial and friendly service. She remembers that when she started out in this business she did not have a lot of products to offer and so could not make good sales during the day; however, she sought a solution, saved up a little capital, and gradually was able to put together her small store. Now sales are going very well for her. She has been in this business for two years and always has the help of her spouse. What she enjoys most about her work is conversing with her customers and watching them start the day with a smile. The most difficult thing about her work is getting up early to open the shop and balancing this with the care of her young baby, though when she feels tired she knows that this is her work and that it has to get done. For this reason she hopes her business will grow and provide her better income.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is very grateful knowing that she has financial assistance and can thus feel more confident moving forward with her business. She also pledges to make punctual payments of her dues. She is happy to belong to her community bank, as all of its members are very responsible and caring. With the money requested (S\/. 1000), she will buy additional products with which to stock her grocery store, such as rice, sugar, eggs, pasta, vegetables, fruits, and other items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1154130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy additional products with which to stock her grocery store, such as rice, sugar, eggs, pasta, vegetables, fruits, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-07T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-06T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.95,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456506,"comment":null},{"amount":63.81,"local_amount":159.53,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":168.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452167,"comment":null},{"amount":63.57,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447343,"comment":null},{"amount":68.57,"local_amount":171.42,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053243,"comment":null},{"amount":71.12,"local_amount":177.81,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":187.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188176,"comment":null},{"amount":72.98,"local_amount":182.44,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":192.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572067,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T20:48:45Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":456368,"name":"Agua Marina Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cAGUA MARINA\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el ciclo decimo primero ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por seis integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Maxima es la Presidenta.

2002 raising animals with savings amounting to 25,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her tenacity and perseverance, today her farm consists of two dairy cows, seven sheep, four heifers, and 13 goats. Her monthly income is about 20,000 som (KGS) from the sale of dairy and milk products. Gulmairam also works eight acres of irrigated land and 16 acres of non-irrigated clover and wheat. For the processing of grain, her husband built a small mill that brings in about 7,000 som (KGS) in the seasonal months. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Gulmairam approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 102,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional heads of cattle -- calves. In the future, Gulmairam wants to increase her farm and expand her
