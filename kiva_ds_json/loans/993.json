At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeyerlita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeyerlita hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1234826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leyerlita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960325,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2740.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095042,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.97,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484192,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":685.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036710,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T16:35:51Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495244,"name":"Dania Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santa Rosa del Pe\u00f1\u00f3n se Llama el municipio donde habita Dania del Carmen una preciosa ciudad dedicada en diferentes actividades comerciales.\n\nDania necesita un financiamiento de Kiva y Ceprodel para la compra de una refrigeradora, dicho pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 de mucho beneficio debido a que podr\u00e1 guardar sus alimentos y vivir en una mejor condici\u00f3n saludable con su familia. \n\nEs madre soltera con dos hijos bajo su cargo donde trabaja como maestra de educaci\u00f3n primaria, con lo poco que ella gana a duras penas mantiene a su familia en su alimentaci\u00f3n, pero debido a la necesidad que ella presenta en su hogar solicita este tipo de cr\u00e9dito. \n\nDe momento solo cuenta con su buena salud, su capacidad de trabajo, su peque\u00f1a vivienda que la ha ido construyendo con muchas dificultades que ha presentado en el transcurso de su vida.\n\n \n","en":"Dania del Carmen lives in the municipality of Santa Rosa del Pe\u00f1\u00f3n, a beautiful city home to a number of business activities.\r\nDania needs a loan from Kiva and Ceprodel to buy a refrigerator.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nFedelina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFedelina hopes to expand her business and dreams to have a good life by the grace of God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1123116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fedelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6849.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095056,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484206,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3424.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036724,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4166.93,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355781312,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500.07,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2568.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364488278,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-13T01:51:30Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:50:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495419,"name":"Annet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annet lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She is a very conscientious and hard-working woman. She is married to a kind man named Mamurchon, and they have 5 children. Her husband works at a sausage factory and earns 1,000 Tajiistan Somoni per month. For the last 20 years, Sayora has been raising cattle and growing crops. She and her husband try to provide their children with good housing and education. Their eldest son, Kodirchon, is now a first-year student at the Tajikistan State Medical University. However, because Sayora did not have a good harvest this year, she is not in the position to be able to pay for her son's tuition. For this reason, she is seeking a loan so she can cover the cost of his studies.

She and her husband have 2 sons. Her husband and sons work doing plastering and finishing. They renovate buildings, and whenever it is possible, they do repairs in their own house to save money, but most of the work is done by builders. Mahbuba wants to help one of her sons with his marriage plans next year, but there are not enough rooms in their house so the family has decided to build a couple more rooms for the newlyweds. Mahbuba will use the loan to buy construction materials. She is grateful for your financial assistance.

At an early age, she decided to live independently with the intent of providing her mother with all the necessary support.  She currently owns a home made of solid materials.  When she was a girl, Nelva helped her mother with all of the farm work until she became an adult.  She then inherited plots of cacao and started her work in a more proactive manner.  This is how she became a cacao producer.  Nelva has already been doing this for two years and has been able to move forward with her business.  She also has the help of day laborers.  Nelva admits that the work in the fields is very hard, especially with cacao since it requires a great deal of attention.  She finds it comforting that she is able to sell the dried kernels to traders who offer a good price.  \r\n<p>\r\nNelva has entered into the season of maintaining her farm by grafting plants, sowing her nursery, and acquiring fumigation supplies and sacks of organic compost.  This enables her to make the most of her land.  In addition, she needs to hire day laborers and must pay half their salary in advance.  \r\n<p>\r\nNelva plans to continue working with the same level of motivation and effort.  She would like to open a grocery store in the city so that her mother can have a peaceful job without having to work in the fields.  This will be her seventh loan.

He plans to use the profits to buy a tractor instead of using human labor.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is a hard and dedicated worker, with a strong desire to get ahead. She lives with her partner, Evaristo, who works in sales.

For this business everyday she sets up her fryer, tables and chairs, in a space set aside for this in her home. Close to her home there are streets that are very busy. She considers her business to be profitable because it gives her good income. She likes her business because it generates income to cover household costs and to help her husband. However, it is tiring to have to set up and take down her sales stand everyday, but this does not discourage her and she has the desire to continue working.

This is why there is a lot of milk and many dairy products, like cheese, cottage cheese and cream.\r\n\r\nMany people, original from the countryside, have been born and raised here, and they have got ahead in life through a lot of hard work, which is admirable.

She has three children, all of them independent. She was born in a district, 20 km from Achuapa. She learned to be a hardworking person already when she was a child, as her parents taught her to work the land, sow grains and milk the cows.\r\n\r\nBut she wanted to get ahead in life and her biggest dream was to be a teacher, because she loved to teach others how to read and write. This is why she moved to the urban area, to study and then work, which is how she has been able to have her own house and a decent living. Besides, she has kept her farm and her animals, because she thinks her roots are something important in her life.\r\n\r\nWith the goal to improve her quality of life, she would like to renovate her kitchen.

He tells us that he works as an agricultural worker but a little over a year ago decided to start his own business since he wasn't making enough money to support his family. He wants to give his family a better life and pay for his children's schooling, so he started thinking about what business was lacking in his community that would make a profit and that his wife and children could help him run.

Her father and brother were killed during the Acehnese civil war and the shop of her family was burnt down. The sales of Nazava Water Filters offer a great opportunity for her and her husband to increase their daily income. \n\nIn just 6 months Salma sold over 300 water filters and provided over 1500 people with access to safe and affordable drinking water. Most of Salma\u2019s customers are poor to lower income coffee farmers that earn less than 5 USD per day. Compared to buying water households save 132 USD per year using Nazava Water Filters, which enable them to purify rain, well or river water and make it safe to drink. \n\nTo respond to the high demand for Nazava water filters in her district, Salma would like to purchase bigger stock at reduced costs. She has already established a network of 5 sub-resellers that can directly sell the filters to their customers. \u201cI currently have the cash for just 25 filters, that\u2019s why I run out of stock easily, which is bad for my business.

When he was little there weren\u2019t too many schools in his community and only elementary school classes were available.  If one wanted to continue going to school one had to leave and go to other towns and this was very costly so he had to learn how to work in the fields.

Even though sugarcane is only harvested once a year it produces good profits he\u2019s used to support his family the last few years.\n\nWith a Vision Fund loan, Cleto will be able to buy manure and fertilizer.

She lives alone and is a very hardworking, very cheerful woman who belongs to an indigenous town called Francisco Serrato where the Mazahua culture still predominates.  She\u2019s part of the group called \u201cMussha.\u201d  She says that they formed this group because several of the people wanted to start business of their own because people in the big towns wouldn\u2019t hire them because they came from indigenous communities.  \u201cPeople in the cities sometimes discriminate against us because we speak our own dialect and dress in traditional, multi-colored skirts and they don\u2019t want to hire us which is why we are asking for loans to set up our own businesses,\u201d she says.  \n\nShe says that she did not go to school because she\u2019s been an orphan since she was very little and her grandmother didn\u2019t care one way or the other if she went to school or not.  She says that she taught herself to embroider when she was very little and also how to plant since she has large parcels of land with very fertile soil that produces very good quality corn.\n\nShe has a business selling candy, fast-food snacks, soft-drinks and juice outside a school and her town\u2019s health center and she says that she does well since there are just two stands there.  She buys the candy in a nearby town where she finds low prices and the soft-drinks are delivered to her by the various soft-drink company delivery trucks.\n\nRight now she\u2019s asking for a loan because she wants to stock her stand and also wants to sell marigolds and velvet to sell in her community for the Day of the Dead since year after year residents in her community visit the graves of their departed and decorate them with flowers and food which is why the loan is urgently needed now so she can buy everything she needs.\n\nShe says that she\u2019ll go buy the flowers in a town near her community that specializes in growing this type of flower used for Day of the Dead.  She says that she\u2019s very happy because she thinks she\u2019ll do very well.  She\u2019s grateful to Vision Fund because her life has been improving thanks to the loans she\u2019s requested because with profits obtained she\u2019s been buying one or two sheets of metal to make improvements in her little house because it\u2019s made of wood and pasteboard.\n\nThe other six members of the group are Venancio, Aurelia, Elpidio, Aurelia, Mar\u00eda Eduviges and Yolanda.  They will invest their loans in a carpentry shop buying supplies to manufacture furniture, in a sewing shop buying fabric and supplies to make traditional indigenous costumes, to stock up on soft-drinks to sell, to buy supplies to do artisanal embroidery and to buy some goats to raise and then sell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1228926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy marigolds, candy, soft-drinks and juice to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Venancio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elpidio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eduwiges","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2417.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2574.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2630.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2686.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2744.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2804.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2864.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2926.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2989.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3054.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3187.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":203.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.94},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.88},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":385.43,"local_amount":4992.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5016.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120097,"comment":null},{"amount":410.51,"local_amount":5317.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5342.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068146,"comment":null},{"amount":428.41,"local_amount":5548.96,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5575.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284884,"comment":null},{"amount":447.1,"local_amount":5790.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5818.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199174,"comment":null},{"amount":469.68,"local_amount":6083.48,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6112.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595980,"comment":null},{"amount":483.87,"local_amount":6267.27,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6297.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663423,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T20:44:40Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492133,"name":"Emiliano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Emiliano es cliente de la instituci\u00f3n desde hace varios meses, es una persona a\u00fan muy joven con muchas ganas de superarse.

He is still a young person with a strong will to get ahead in life. Mr. Emiliano is forty years old. He finished high school and he has been married to Mrs. Azucena for nineteen years. They have a family, composed of three children that go to school. Mr. Emiliano has a printing workshop where he sells printing services (both on paper and on clothes), invitations, flyers, etc.\n\nMr. Emiliano says, \u201dI started from scratch, since I was and employee in a printing workshop myself for sixteen years, but I wanted to start my own business in order to be able to manage my own time and work. I had the experience that was required, so I just needed to make the decision and start this printing business.\u201d\n\nMr. Emiliano opens his workshop very early and provides the best service possible. He is requesting the loan to buy an offset printer and some components for a machine, a screen printing machine, an iron for drying and some design equipment he was missing. Without this machine he would not be able to provide a good service.\n\nHe tries to keep his customers satisfied. Fortunately, he does well with his business. If things continue as they are, he would like to expand his business, saying: \u201cI would like the business to be profitable enough to help me pay for my children\u2019s education; I would love to see them getting a professional degree. I deeply appreciate the help of the institution, since with previous loans I have been able to expand my business, by buying more material that I was lacking. Now, I can provide more services, like printed t-shirts, medical prescription forms, invitations, canvas, etc.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1229273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an offset printer, some components for a machine, a screen printing machine, an iron for drying and design equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T01:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T01:30:18Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emiliano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1349.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1380.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1412.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1445.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1479.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1514.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1549.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1585.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1622.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1660.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.76,"local_amount":5588.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5697.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120104,"comment":null},{"amount":115.95,"local_amount":1480.26,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1509.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068153,"comment":null},{"amount":364.4,"local_amount":4651.95,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4742.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284891,"comment":null},{"amount":256.89,"local_amount":3279.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3343.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199180,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T05:57:04Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":492142,"name":"Meloma Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Meloma est\u00e1 conformado por 8 mujeres muy trabajadoras ellas viven en una comunidad hermosa donde la gente aun conversa en su lengua materna, platican que el nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque as\u00ed se llama su pueblo solo que esta en su lengua materna llamada Mazahua.

This is his first loan from the institution.  \r\n\r\nCasto will use this loan to buy a motorcycle, which is something he needs very much, because it will allow him to do his work in a more efficient manner.  He has contracts to complete, and this will allow him to get around more quickly to his work sites, because he has long distances that he has to travel.  He is in a rural area where the distances are long between the towns and the road is not in good condition for cars, and so a motorcycle would be very useful.  His reason for requesting this loan is so that he can continue to improve in his work.  \r\n\r\nCasto is a very hardworking person who feels happy about the credit opportunity that he is getting, because this is the only activity he has that allows him to support himself.

Kiva a few times in the past in order to develop and expand her business. She is systematically developing two sales outlets, working at one herself and having hired a salesperson for the second one. She earns a steady income from them, and recently has been able to buy exercise equipment so she can take care of her health. Thanks to her previous loan from Kiva, she was able to buy a collection of spring-summer sportswear (tracksuits, shorts, and t-shirts) at a good price, and successfully sold it. This time, Nataliya is seeking a loan of 8,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia to buy new goods for her second outlet to increase sales. She plans to buy warm tracksuits and jackets to sell for the winter when the ski season kicks into high gear. Nataliya is not afraid of difficulties; however, she is somewhat worried about the increase of internet shopping for clothing, as young people are not coming to shop at the market as often, which is leading to a drop-off in business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1234562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase new goods for her second sales outlet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Pavlograd","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.516667 35.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nataliya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:28:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323024868,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331160983,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339545848,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347095674,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T21:16:12Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:40:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495814,"name":"Rasela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasela  is a 52-year-old married woman with six children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nGlicelle operates an accessories retail business. What she basically does is buy accessory items from a wholesaler and sell them by the piece or pack for a profit. Her products range from beaded jewelry like necklaces and other similar products to bags, lotion and perfume. Customers are attracted to buy from Glicelle's business due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are students and mall patrons. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantities and varieties of accessory products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGlicelle hopes to have her own house and dreams of being able to give her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God as she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has been working as a teacher in a junior high school in her area for around 15 years. Her husband is a driver who transports construction material. Her children are all in school. The house where she lives with her family is in need of major renovations as the conditions are very bad. Zaynura and her husband have been working for many years to save up money for repairs, but have not yet managed to set aside enough.

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and in her personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 PHP loan for her to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add in her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAlma dreams that her children will finish studying with a good and quality education. She hopes that she and her family will continue to have good health and a strong spiritual life. She never fails to attend the fellowship* every week, for the teachings and sharing of the word of God continue to enlighten and uplift her spirit. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1235621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Her husband is working in Russia, as there is no steady source of income in her village; he is a builder there and sends monthly money home as he is able.  Inobat lives with her son and daughter, who help her around the farm.  The main family income is from raising livestock.  By saving the money her husband has sent over the course of a year, Inobat bought a few head of livestock not long ago and she is trying to increase her business.  In this way, she can support her family.  Inobat's elder son is already grown up and she is preparing for his wedding, so she turned to our organization for help.  She would like to receive a loan to use for her son's wedding.  She is not capable of spending a large amount of money on this event and she has decided to take out a loan, which her husband has agreed to help repay.  She thanks us in advance for the understanding and support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1234439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase wedding accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Taboshar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.568889 69.640278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-15T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inobat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":108.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":111.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":113.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":116.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":122.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":128.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":138.89},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":145.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495901,"name":"Puspa Kencana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Puspa Kencana group is getting their fourth loan from MUK.

Her neighbours are complimentary both about her work and about Isabel as a person.  She is well known and popular as she is a very friendly and hardworking woman, and she has gained the trust of her neighbours, who can see how she has bettered herself day by day.  \r\n\r\nHer dearest wish is to continue making an income from her business which, to date, has helped her to cover most of her household  needs.

She has acquired enough experience over these years to be able to attract a sizable clientele but her stock of merchandise does not permit her to satisfy her customers. She is thus asking for this loan to be able to buy more cases of drinks and grow her stock of merchandise (healthful drinks).

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of  500 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Edna is requesting a loan for 15,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands the business. \r\n\r\nEdna hopes to give her children a good education and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work with her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week,  where she draws strength and inspiration from God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

","en":"Rahimjon is Arvand's client since 2010. He makes a living by selling men's clothing on a market. His wife and son help Rahimjon in running the business. Initially, Rahimjon didn't want to take out a loan, because he wasn't confident in his revenues. But, thanks to advice from his friends, he took a risk, asked for a loan and exceeded all of his expectations. He was able to expand his shop and product range with the new profits.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
