Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

was born in 1994 in a small town near Hanoi. The woman sitting next to her in this picture is her mother. Currently, she studies geography at Hanoi University of Natural Resources and Environment (http:\/\/www.hunre.edu.vn\/hunre\/vn\/portal\/index.jsp). Even though, it is a very difficult subject, she decided to apply for this course to follow her passion. However, now she is about to have to defer her study since her family does not have enough money to pay for tuition fees. Both her father and mother are farmers. Besides, her mother also sells fish and chickens. However, her family's monthly income is only 16,000,000 VND which is not enough for a big family of six members. As a result, Vui would love to borrow 10,710,000 VND to spend on tuition fees. She hopes that after graduation she can find a stable job, be able to support her family and also the community where she lives. Vui believes that there are many students like her who are struggling to follow their dreams and are seeking  help. Through this program, she would like to thank the program and expects that more students would like to receive the same support as she does."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":29.17,"image":{"id":1486138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"with tuition fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Dong Anh- Ha Noi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":85,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":10710000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":595000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":595000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":615460.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439843534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T03:21:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654227,"name":"Kule","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Kule.

She believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase her yields and she will not only get enough food for her family but will also sell the surplus and obtain money to contribute to her children\u2019s education.\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum, and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-07T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-05T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wankuru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philgona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":48300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":48300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-19T07:27:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642721,"name":"Saroen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saroen, 52, lives with her husband in a village in Kampong Cham province\u2019s Ponhea Krek district, Cambodia.

38, is a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rodolfo and they have children. She and her husband manage their household while operating their business. Maricel works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaricel operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Maricel earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Maricel earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nMaricel is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to help her continue operating her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nMaricel dreams of expanding her business and hopes that her children will finish their studies.

Marufakhon's husband is currently a migrant worker in Russia, whereas she's a dairy farmer in Tajikistan; she's been at it for more than 5 years, selling milk, kefir, sour cream, and a number of other dairy products, and currently has 8 cows on her farm.  Her children and daughters-in-law help tend to the farm, and she has a number of regular customers thanks to the high quality of her dairy products.\r\n\r\nMarufakhon is preparing for her daughter's upcoming wedding, but lacks the money to buy everything necessary for one.

He is single and has no children. He lives in his parents' house with his 3 siblings and his parents whom he loves and supports very much. Fernando's activity is being an electrician. This consists of making repairs to electronic equipment, stereos and more. He learned this trade by going to an industrial training center. He liked it and has done this work for 2 years. Seeing that his labor was required constantly, he started to buy basic materials needed to do his work with the best results. Now he works with private companies that need his services. He has the help and support of another electrician who lends him electronic equipment that he doesn't have right now. What he likes about this activity is that it has allowed him to have substantial income with which he is able to pay for his own household expenses and give his siblings a better quality of life. What he doesn't like about his activity is the risk involved in its execution and he has to be working until very late at night to be able to finish and deliver electrical wiring plans by the date they are ordered. These work hours have caused him some health problems, but he is not discouraged and he keeps going forward. He wants to open his own electrical workshop. At this time, he will ask for s\/. 2500. He is grateful for the confidence and help that has been given to him so that he can firm up his plans. In addition, he is committed to making his payments on time.

High quality grapes which he gathers from his orchard are used in wine production and are highly demanded among local wine producers. \r\n\r\nVahram applied for the loan to be able to enlarge his farm. By requesting this loan of USD 1,000, Vahram would like to pay for renovation of the greenhouse and also purchase fuel for organizing the cultivation process of the sunflowers. He took a loan before from a local financial institution, but unfortunately he wasn't able to pay it back; however, thanks to his hard work during recent times, Vahram has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. Therefore, he has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future, he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

He is 22 years old. Abdukarim lives in a village in the Qubadiyon region. He intends to launch a livestock business. He plans to do it at his home. He has a cow stall by his house. Abdukarim plans to raise sheep. Many rural residents in Tajkistan raise livestock and grow produce. Abdukarim also wants to follow this local tradition.

She now lives in a rented house along with her husband and her little ones, striving to advance. Cimi's work consists of making articles of clothing. She has a workshop in her home, and she has been doing this work for 17 years. Everything that she knows she learned by working since she was a young woman as an employee of a woman who worked in this occupation. Little by little and with much patience, she learned the techniques of dressmaking and decided to become independent to generate her own income, putting into practice everything that her employer taught her up to that time. Now she is part of a sewing workshop that she established with a partner. During the time that she has done this work, she has always searched for the best way to do her work, since many times the pressure of her customers has made her feel that she was not going to be able to complete her work efficiently. Nevertheless, she has coped with adversities, and now she has plans to expand her business, but she knows that the road to achieve this is long, and for the moment she wants to keep this as a long-term goal. Now she will prepare to begin to make her own designs and sell them, since she has orders from her customers. At this time she is applying for 1800 PEN. She is very happy to know that there are people who will offer her financial backing to continue developing her business. She also promises to be a punctual and responsible partner. With the amount she has applied for, she will stock her sewing workshop by buying fabrics, needles, threads, and other accessories that she needs in order to continue with her dressmaking work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1506653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy dressmaking materials such as fabrics, needles, threads, and other accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":269.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":286.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":297.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":299.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":319.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":328.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.43},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.03},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-07T20:42:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642799,"name":"Rovshen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rovshen is 45 years old, married, with 3 kids ages 3, 9, and 11.

Maximilla joined One Acre Fund so that she could earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  \r\n\r\nBecause she wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Maximilla has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Maximilla's life because she has more profits from her harvest.  In the future, Maximilla hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nMaximilla and the Imani Farmers Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo, standing on the left.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ferika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":406524,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406524}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642815,"name":"Andrew's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chepsitat is a group of nine group leader farmers in the Chwele District with Andrew selected as the Kiva group representative. \r\n\r\nAndrew joined One Acre Fund because he wants to promote the area he lives in.

Jacob has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJacob is a reliable member of the community. He is married with four children. Jacob is 34 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 10 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Jacob is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJacob first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2009 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Jacob joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member.  Jacob plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to repair the home and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Jacob\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and more farm group support. \r\n\r\nJacob and the Imani WG Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to access hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":4325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Electina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliff","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":374430,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374430}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642831,"name":"Hasmik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasmik is 34 years old and she lives in Koghes village in Lori region.

Wabuke has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize seeds and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet seeds.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWabuke is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with four children.  Wabuke is 32 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 10 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Wabuke is very active in his community and is involved in the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and also continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Wabuke\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  He first joined One Acre Fund in 2007 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  As an active member in his community, Wabuke also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Wabuke plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from his harvest.\r\n\r\nWabuke and the Hope Life Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wabuke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":470712,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470712}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642861,"name":"Gulnora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnora was born in 1984.

For the past 30 years, he has worked making and selling plaster moldings. He learned this profession through hands-on practice, and over time he continued to perfect his technique. He currently has a shop open to the public, but with the aim of expanding, he wants to open another branch in a municipality in the eastern part of Antioquia, since he sees great opportunity in that area for expanding his business and gaining recognition for his products and services. For this reason, he is requesting support through the loan, which will allow him to finish setting up his new shop. The funds will be invested in improvements to the shop and buying wholesale supplies (powdered plaster and other chemicals). In this way, he will be able to start his new project, through which he hopes to achieve greater profitability, offering innovative and high-quality products which his customers will use to decorate their homes in a modern style.

Other than farming, she is also involved in community activities such as the women's and prayer groups. Janepher described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Long Rains season won\u2019t be Janepher\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund.  She joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and has continued working with them to get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and to earn enough to feed her family. As an active member in her community, Janepher also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she wants to help more farmers. Janepher also became a One Acre Fund group leader because she was elected and this shows that farmers in her group have confidence in her. \r\n \r\nJanepher and the Epeneza Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJanepher plans on using future profits from her harvest to repair her home and buy a cow.  Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from her harvest and is able to save money and feed her family.

Since the death of her husband, she has brought in a small income. She had to work to provide for the needs of her two children.   \r\n\r\nFrom a friend she learned about Amway and began selling Amway products (linens, kitchen appliances, cosmetics and detergent). Her neighbors, relatives and friends became her customers. Since she knew a lot of people, making sales wasn\u2019t a problem. Later, she sold products from other companies the same way. \r\n\r\nWith her loan from Maya, she will order products to sell to her clients. When she applied for the loan, she already had customers waiting to order.  Because she sells from catalogs, she took orders from customers without the products on hand and ordered them wholesale. When she has the money in advance, she can order the products from the company at a discount. This way her profits are greater.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue doing this work as long as she is in good health. When she meets friends and neighbors, she can show them the products in the catalogs easily. She has the items they order shipped to her home and then delivers them to her clients. This type of work has advantages for \u00dclker, who also has time to spend on her home and children. \r\n\r\nBecause \u00dclker wasn\u2019t able to study, she wants her children to stay in school and she wants to give them a better life. Her son is currently enrolled in college and his goal is to study four more years.

He is pictured here in a group of five One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 69 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Pius has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPius is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with eight children.  Pius is 36 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 10 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Pius is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and enjoy the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPius first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.

With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
