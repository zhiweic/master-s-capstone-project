Zebur works as an administrator, his brother as a barmen, mother as a cleaner and father as a manager. The hotel is very small so the salaries are very small too. Their additional income is Zebur\u2019s grandmothers\u2019 monthly pension. The family's total income is hardly enough to cover monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nZebur requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Zebur will purchase a car. The hotel where they all work doesn\u2019t have a car to serve the clients, so he wants to buy a car and rent it to the hotel owners. This will bring him an additional monthly income. With the increased income Zebur will be able to help his family with covering their expenses. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1334.25,"image":{"id":1327100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a car ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kakhaberi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zebur ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.4},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.02},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.03},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.46},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.3},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.4,"local_amount":154.4,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":154.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969130,"comment":null},{"amount":156.46,"local_amount":156.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":156.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749548,"comment":null},{"amount":161.56,"local_amount":161.56,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":161.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613455,"comment":null},{"amount":164.02,"local_amount":164.02,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":164.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857173,"comment":null},{"amount":167.93,"local_amount":167.93,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133826,"comment":null},{"amount":172.91,"local_amount":172.91,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107416,"comment":null},{"amount":176.03,"local_amount":176.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":176.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254971,"comment":null},{"amount":180.94,"local_amount":180.94,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":180.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019127,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T04:45:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545561,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 54-year-old Lebanese married man living with his wife and three young children who are still attending school.

He has lived with his wife Jessica for 12 years. He loves her very much and they have two children together. They care for them in the house that they bought some years ago. He has worked in agriculture since he was very young and his main crops are potatoes, peas, and corn. He plants them on his own farmland. What he likes most about his work is being able to clear the weeds from his crops. What he doesn't like are the frosts that come on due to the rain, because he loses many crops, generating losses. For this reason, and because he is a very smart person, Fredy also has livestock. He raises rams, pigs, and guinea pigs, which he fattens and then sells at a good price. This way, he meets his family's needs. Things are going well for him in his business, so he is thinking about buying a ranch, where he can care for his animals better. Fredy will invest the 3,500 soles in organic fertilizer to nourish his fields and he promises to make his payments on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1326891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-07T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-07T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3557.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352474,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T04:23:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:03:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545427,"name":"Cecilia Mirna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Cecilia Mirna es su tercer cr\u00e9dito, es maestra del colegio de primaria en una escuela p\u00fablico desde hace 33 a\u00f1os.\n\nEste cr\u00e9dito sera  utilizado para reparaci\u00f3n de cambio de techo en la compra de zinc, alfajillas, clavos y otros materiales para mejorar en un dormitorio el techo\n","en":"This is the third loan for Cecilia Mirna.

She is married and has two children who live at home. They study in school and depend on her for everything. Day after day, together with her husband, she has looked for a way to earn an income for their household. Thanks to her effort, she was able to open a business that sells dairy products like butter, and different types of cheese in the area where they live. She got the land where they grow things like corn and beans as an inheritance from her parents. Her customers for the different products that she sells and makes are neighbors and nearby communities close to where she lives. Her crops are 100 meters from her house. She walks there every day. She learned this activity when she was very young, because her parents have been farmers their whole lives. Currently, she is asking for help to buy fertilizers and manure for her corn and bean crops. This will keep them safe and free from the plagues that damage them.

","en":"The \"Las Flores 2\" group is found located in a very tranquil community in which many people work growing corn.  The majority of the group members have known each other since they were little.  They express that they enjoy living in this community because the festivals are very pleasant, especially the festival to celebrate the Virgen of Guadalupe on December 12th.  There are seven members that make up this group, all of them very hard-working and responsible women.  They they choose the group name because they liked it a lot and everyone agreed.\r\n\r\nLuci, who is the group's representative, is 20 years old and has lived with Marco Antonio in a common law marriage for the past four years.  Together they have formed a family with one child who does not yet attend school.  Luci is requesting the loan to be able to purchase two young lambs that she will raise so that they can reproduce and someday she will have enough and can sell them when she encounters financial problems.  She began raising sheep five years ago and had two sheep, but she had to sell them.  For this reason, she wants to have sheep again.  Luci comments \"I really enjoy this activity.  The only difficulty is that at this moment, I don't have a stable to accomodate them.\"  Luci believes that if the sheep don't have a good stable, they may get sick more easily because it is cold in the mornings.  However, this hasn't hindered her from continuing to raise her sheep so that some day, she will have many sheep, both large and small.  This will help Luci's family to live without financial worries.  Like Luci, the rest of the group members are also happy to receive the loan that Vision Fund and KIVA have granted them.  Do\u00f1a Gregoria will invest in traditional clothing.  Luisa and Veronica will invest in a grocery store.  Rosario will invest in raising chickens. Ma Rosario will invest in clothing.  Do\u00f1a Juana will invest in sweets and Mariana will invest in chickens.

She weaves for income while her husband is a carpenter to support the family. \r\n\r\nLhingboi says weaving without a loom is painful for her backbone and a lot of time is consumed to finish the woven products. She wanted to get a loom, but always failed because she has three kids to take care of. Providing them with education is not a small task for irregular incomes like theirs. She could weave only two or three wrap-around skirts in a month, provided she is in good health. The amount she gets after the sales are not sufficient to start a weaving business. There never was a time where she could spare her savings to get a loom. On the other hand, her husband earns money by woodworking, which provides an unreliable income. He gets orders for furniture and most of the time, he fails to deliver them on time because he can\u2019t afford to buy advanced tools for his woodworking. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Lhingboi will get a loom and try to secure her business by producing more woven products with the help of the loom. She also says that her chance for weaving at middle age is very low but with the loom, she can continue her weaving activity for a long time. And with the returns, she is planning to get advanced tools for her husband, to enable him to be successful in his business, too.  \r\n\r\nShe says that both her husband and herself will continue their businesses until their kids can replace them and manage the family.

The oldest is married and the other 4 live with her. The youngest is studying in school. She learned this activity more than 18 years ago, taught by her parents. She sells her product near her home to neighbors, people who sell on a small scale in the local market, and others. This business has worked for them for a long time and it is their only income for the family, covering their basic necessities, such as food, clothing, medicines, etc. Their crop is located 50 meters from their house, and they go there everyday. This allows them to give their crop better maintenance and protection.

is 37-year-old Hawanatu. She is married and has three children aged 15, 12 and 10 years. In 2000, Hawanatu established her local foodstuff (groundnuts, rice and beans) business. She began her business as a way to support her husband in taking good care of the home. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and eight hours a day, she earns about 600,000 SLL (Sierra Leone leones) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 6,000,000 SLL.

Having successfully repaid the previous loan, he is now taking a new loan in the amount of 2,900 USD to be able to purchase an oven.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

Walter was able to receive both an elementary and high school education, receiving his diploma in 2012 from the high school he attended the last year.\r\n\r\nBasically, he has always lived with his entire family: his parents, his minor sister and a niece.  They rent their home and use most of their income to pay for rent and food, and to cover university costs.

is 50 years old. He and his wife are happy and have four children. He is very hardworking and kind-natured. He has a lot of friends and all of them love him very much.\r\n\r\nGulmurod has been busy with farming for 20 years, producing onions, carrots, wheat and other agriculture produce.

Milk and yoghurt he sells to the neighbors. Milk and meat-selling brings 170 AZN in income per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes, such as pilau and dolma, and always use yoghurt sauce. Milk products are considered as very healthy and are also present in everyday life.   \n\nThis is the only financial income in his family and is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved son. Balakhan applied for 1,500 AZN to purchase three cattle, two milking cows and fodder.

is a 51-year-old married man from Lebanon. He is living with his wife and only one working child. In 1995, in order to supplement the family\u2019s income, he decided to start his own work. His job consists of selling vegetables. He has a wide variety of goods which he sells to customers from his town and the neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nToday, he is asking to borrow a loan from Kiva partner Vitas s.a.l. to purchase a vegetable cart, where he can expose all his products.

He lives in a small village of Didgori District with his wife and two children. Tariel has requested for a loan from local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTariel works as an artisan at a local building company. His wife works as a nurse at the hospital. They both get a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTariel has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

Since 1989, he has been earning a living by growing carrots, cabbages, watermelons, melons, beets, and garlic. He is helped with the farm work by his wife and 2 children, who are 18 and 20 years old.

They sell and market products and services to bottom of the pyramid (BoP) consumers.\n\nAlfones targets people who are typically not reached by traditional marketing. They go directly to the consumer, as opposed to requiring them to visit their shop. Alfones\u2019 products and services include mobile phones, mobile banking services, solar lights, and efficient cookstoves.\n\nAlfones started selling Paradigm\u2019s efficient firewood cookstoves in 2010. They saw it as a beneficial product for their customers, most of whom live in rural areas and cook over three-stone fires. This traditional cooking method produces large amounts of health-damaging smoke and is very inefficient, contributing to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves reduce the toxic smoke a woman inhales by 70% and reduces the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%, saving families money and time spent buying or collecting firewood.\n\nAlex and Juliet started Alfones together in 2005. Their storefront is located in the town of Sagana, Kirinyaga county, while most marketing is field-based with operations extending to Muranga, Laikipia, Naivasha, and Nakuru counties. Alfones employs ten full-time staff, seven of whom are female.  Alfones reaches an estimated 24,000 people, over 95% of whom are women. Cookstove sales are strong and nowadays require Juliet\u2019s full attention. Juliet and her sales agents are responsible for cookstove marketing and sales, while Alex continues manages the other aspects of the business.\n\nAlfones currently offers its customers the ability to buy their cookstoves in three monthly installments. It has an almost perfect repayment rate as the groups they work with ensure proper repayment from its members. More customers are eager to purchase cookstoves, but Alfones struggles to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves to allow more women to pay on credit. With a loan from Kiva, Alfones will be able to offer cookstoves to more women and offer better credit terms of four monthly installments instead of three.\n\nWith a Kiva loan of $4,650, Alfones will receive 300 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members improved financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the stoves accessible to even the lowest income women in their customer base.\n\nHelp improve the health and financial stability of a rural family in Kenya today!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":1323303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Sagana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.666667 37.2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-04-08T17:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-08T17:20:01Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":163,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfones Communications Ltd","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1179.69,"local_amount":1179.69,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1179.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373020134,"comment":null},{"amount":1194.37,"local_amount":1194.37,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807987,"comment":null},{"amount":1143.91,"local_amount":1143.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-28T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1143.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390668058,"comment":null},{"amount":1132.03,"local_amount":1132.03,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-26T08:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399913863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-11T19:19:18Z","paid_date":"2013-09-26T08:46:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":545705,"name":"Maroun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maroun is a 34-year-old Lebanese man.

is 59 years old. She lives in Khoni district with husband, her 25-year-old son, and her 23-years-old daughter-in-law. Mariam requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family's poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nHer family owns an agricultural plot of land where maize is grown. Also they have a milk cow. Mariam is milking the cow to make dairy products and sells them along with the harvested maize at the local markets.\r\n\r\nMariam requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Mariam wants to start trading in household goods. She will go to the capital city to purchase stock at wholesale prices, bring it to her village and sell it with the price markup among her villagers. This business will bring good profits to Mariam's family. She plans to reinvest part of the profit in the same business and use another part for providing better living conditions for her family.

He also makes a living in livestock farming, caring for cows, bulls, donkeys, rams, and pigs.  After fattening the animals, he sells them for a better price.  \r\n\r\nHis main challenge is not having his own working capital; he comments that the sale of his animals helps with this, and it is for this reason that he hopes to improve the care of his animals in the future.  \r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan with KIVA, and he therefore promises to be punctual with his payments.\r\n\r\nManuel will invest the 2500 soles in the purchase of organic fertilizer for his crops.

Due to the large family size and low monthly income, they are facing many problems. Her husband needs additional capital for the growth of his business. She has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can invest in her husband\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money, her husband can buy a variety of goods like rice, sugar, soap, cereals, milk and utility items for his general store to fulfill the demand of customers and to increase his savings for the better future of their children. The profit amount would be used to expand the business and pay the household expenses.\r\n\r\nPervaizan and her husband are very hopeful that the loan will be a lucky and productive one for their

It\u2019s very difficult for Gulnaz to keep the education of her children continued because of the huge educational expenses.\r\n\r\nGulnaz is working hard to meet the family\u2019s needs by stitching clothes. She has been operating her business very efficiently and honestly for the past 7 years. She is very experienced in the stitching and sewing of dresses, and her clients always appreciate her work.\r\n\r\nGulnaz, as a member of a three-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. With the loan amount, she will be purchasing a new sewing machine so that she can work more efficiently in the future, and her production will be increased. She can stitch more dresses in less time with a new machine. As she is living in a rented house with her family, she dreams to build her own house. She also desires to expand her business and provide quality education to her children. With the profit she is planning to open a tailoring centre for girls. Gulnaz and her family are very thankful to both BRAC Pakistan and Kiva for their support.\r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, Gulnaz is raising her

Adrianne envisioned a clean, simple and elegant salon offering a relaxing environment while still communicating a modern, trendy vibe.\r\n\r\nSince opening, The Lab has grown into a bustling business.

Lighting has been a constant issue in her shop, as clients have a hard time seeing the outcome of their stylist\u2019s hard work. This loan will be used towards installing new lights as well as upgrading the front desk and other equipment.\r\n\r\nWith her business thriving, Adrianne hopes to soon open a second location and pass

","en":"Bashorat is 51 years old, married, and has one 16-year-old child. She is a kind and tolerant woman. When she was young, she studied with seamstresses who taught her how to sew women's clothing. She also graduated from the Pedagogical University. She currently works as a high school teacher, but her salary is very low and is not sufficient to provide for her family. She wants to set up her own business sewing women's clothing. She has to work very hard and earn a good income because her husband is unemployed, so she needs to cover all expenses herself. She took a course entitled \"To Get Ahead\" that was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She is seeking a loan of 1,000 Tajikistan Somoni to purchase fabrics so she can establish her business. She is waiting for your kindness.
