He sells mobile phone accessories, air time recharges, chargers and also provides repair services.  He also rents movie DVDs earning enough money this way to contribute to household support.\r\n\r\nJuan learned the activity from a family member who taught him how to manage in business especially in the mobile phone area.  His business has had good results and his sales have gradually increased.  This motivates him to continue seeking alternatives to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is why he\u2019s requesting his 7th loan that he will use to buy a display case and merchandise at wholesale (mobile phones, movies, chargers, screen protectors, cases, etc.) in order to better display his goods and to have a more varied inventory of products on-hand to satisfy his customers\u2019 needs and wants which will lead to a significant increase in sales and in income generated by them.\r\n\r\nWith his warrior spirit and enthusiasm, Juan intends to continue strengthening his small business and dreams with acquiring a larger locale to expand the business and combine it with an Internet caf\u00e9 to provide an integrated service in the same place succeeding in attracting more customers improving his income to provide better quality of life for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1455078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a display case and merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caldas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Pablo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":107541},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":110521},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":113584},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":116731},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":119966},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":123290},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":126707},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":130218},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":133826},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":137534},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":141345},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":145262},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":149287},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153424},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":157675},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":162045},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166535},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171150},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175892},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":180766},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":185775},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":190926}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.14},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.35},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.82},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.44},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.15},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620298,"name":"Halima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima is widowed and has five young children who go to school.

She has four children and has been operating a farm for five years. Her primary income sources are milk and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated that horticulture is what she finds most enjoyable about farming. Her biggest challenge is lack of enough funds. One of the animals on the farm has been given the name Tuyai.\r\n\r\nWhen Regina was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, she replied, \"because of the grace period.\" During Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, she learned that they offer several products, not only dairy cows.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked how the loan will benefit her family, Regina said it would help her to pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Regina owns a cow, but she does not own a pig, poultry, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.

Aida currently needs a loan of USD 1500 to purchase one cow, and some forage for the livestock.

However, thanks to the hard work during the recent times, Aida was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

In the future, he would like to acquire more machines and offer more jobs, improving his the quality of life of his family and of the other people who inspire him in this difficult work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.32,"image":{"id":1455130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy necessary supplies in bulk (fabric, thread, buttons, elastic)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":57107},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":58689},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":60316},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":61987},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":63705},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":65470},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":67284},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":69149},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71065},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73034},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75058},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77136}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.94,"local_amount":76333,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80760.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095689,"comment":null},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":77811,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":82324.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074755,"comment":null},{"amount":46.61,"local_amount":82866,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87672.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009951,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T22:07:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":620374,"name":"Nyadzuwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nyadzuwa is married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

She lives with her husband, her school-age daughter and son (15 and 12 years old), and her parents-in-law. Ripsime's husband works in the private sector. However, he cannot fully meet the family's needs based on his salary alone. To help her husband in earning a living, Hripsime is engaged in breeding a livestock of cows and hens, and in cultivation of tomatoes, peppers, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, strawberries, pomegranate, grapes, apples and pears. The family sells the agricultural products in the local market. \r\n\r\nTo sustain the agribusiness and develop it further, Rripsime currently needs a loan of USD 3000 to purchase a new piece of land and to buy some forage for the livestock. As this is Ripsime\u2019s first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and SEF. The first-chance loan program provides loans to people who didn\u2019t have access to credit products before, because they have no credit history.

lives with her long-term partner and their three children in the city of San Pedro de Macoris. She has run her fruits and vegetables stall in front of her house for over four years, having started it with her own capital. Her latest loan was invested in the business. \r\n\r\nThis is Senovia's fifth loan, which she will use to finish building her house. Many years ago, Senovia started building her house, and with her business profits, she has been able to build her house little by little. Now Senovia wants to invest this loan to buy construction materials such as cement, concrete blocks, rods, and other building materials. She has a wood structure home and she will build a safer structure with concrete blocks and cement. \r\n\r\nEsperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in repaying their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business, and who have shown fidelity in their groups.

She is very excited to be receiving her second loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off her previous loan. She has had her business for around 18 years. Her business consists of selling second-hand clothing. She says her biggest challenge so far in her business has been the seasonality of supply from vendors, which causes drastic changes in prices. With this next loan, she will be able to buy in bulk, which will allow her to get through those tough times of low supply without having to pay the extra high prices. Augustine has big dreams for the future and hopes that one day she will be able to travel abroad to study business. She thanks you all for your support!!!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3127.77,"image":{"id":1452144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

The group consists of 11 microentrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Basile is married with nine children whose ages range from 22 to 36 years old. Basile is very excited to be receiving his second loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off his previous loan. He has had his business for around five years. His business is a general store, selling many different items including drinks, flour, sugar, and other food items. He says his biggest challenge so far is the inconsistency of his suppliers. Often, when he goes to restock his store, the supplier does not have any inventory available for sale. With this next loan, he will be able to buy more of each of these items to further grow his inventory.

She lives in the city of Dushanbe with her daughter. Her daughter is studying at the university. Shahzoda is a housewife and most her time she spends alone at home. Therefore, Shahzoda decided not to just sit around, and she opened a grocery store near her house. She built a small room, and the only thing left is to finish the interior and to buy food. She doesn't have enough money to make repairs and buy goods. Shahzoda believes that people will patronize her shop, and it will not only give her something to do, but will also allow her to contribute to the family budget.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":298,"image":{"id":1454293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to finish building a store and buying food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-10-22T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-21T23:10:07Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahzoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":150.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":154},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":157.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":160.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":164.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":171.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":179.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":188}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.7},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":147.4,"local_amount":147.4,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":147.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561603,"comment":null},{"amount":150.6,"local_amount":150.6,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":150.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030504,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T20:14:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":622385,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 -

She was born into a family of farmers and miners and all her life has been spent in the country. Since she was a child, her father taught her all about agricultural work. While he was working as a day laborer, she cared for the animals at home. Thanks to this, today she makes her living breeding and raising chickens, an activity she alternates with work in the home and the care of her family which consists of her husband and 2 small children. At 25 years of age, she wishes to start another productive project in order to generate sufficient resources to support her husband with the economic burdens of the household. Therefore, she is requesting a loan to buy 10 pigs for breeding, fix up the space in the pens, and to buy food pellets to feed the animals. This will allow her to launch her idea and she will be able to keep an eye on her family while caring for the animals. Also, she sees this activity as a good source of income initially because the Christmas season approaches when it is customary that the demand for this meat will increase. On the other hand, it is a very affordable meat so during the rest of the year the families of Antioquia prefer to consume it which, for her, would be an advantage to be seized. Maria knows that to achieve her goals with this activity she should work steadily, with discipline, commitment, and love and only then will she be able to fulfill the dream of strengthening her business and give her children a good education and improve the quality of life for all her family.

","en":"Sandra is a young, 20-year-old entrepreneur, and the single mother of one child. She started her own business, an internet cafe, which she runs from her own home. She has six stations set up to offer internet services. She got this idea because of her need to make money to pay her basic household expenses while looking after her young son at the same time. \r\n\r\nSandra works alone from Monday to Sunday from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm. She seeks to make the most of her time and to generate more income every day. Her drive, dedication and desire to excel push her to seek out options that will let her continue moving forward. For this reason, and because she's motivated to support her baby, she is requesting this loan to buy more computers. This will let her increase the space she has available and provide better services to her customers, which will allow her to generate more income. In short, this will mean improving her family's well-being and quality of life.\r\n\r\nSandra wants to continue to work hard to achieve her dream of expanding her business, which will help her business to be well-known in the sector and  guarantee improved profitability. This will let Sandra continue to have a good source of income.

She also instructed her in the preparation of the bakery products.  She initially started working with one of her other daughters.  However, due to a serious illness that struck her, she died a little while ago.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with the help and the love of her other children, she knew how to endure the situation.  Little by little she mourned her loss.  Now, another one of her daughters has assumed the challenge and trained in the preparation of breads and other bakery products and pastries.

The business generates enough resources to help her husband with the financial responsibility of the household.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all of the adversities and difficulties that she has experienced, her drive, tenacity, and desire to progress prompt her to request the loan.  She will use the loan to make improvements in order to expand her place.  She currently only has one table, three chairs, and a small wall where her customers sit.

He currently works as an independent merchant, traveling through various municipalities of eastern Antioquia selling merchandise door-to-door on credit. His mode of transportation is a bicycle adapted as a wagon so that he is able to carry the products that he offers. In this way, he has been able to generate sufficient income to take care of his household. With the loan he currently seeks, Jorge will build his business by purchasing wholesale merchandise (cabinets, fans, sheets, pots and pans, and other household items) in preparation for the end of the year sales season.

Legend has it that this town was formerly called El Idolo.  When the Spanish conquerors came, they rested here for a while.  When they moved on, in gratitude to the people of the town, they left a sculpture of San Jos\u00e9.  The people then changed the name of the town to San Jos\u00e9 El Idolo (Saint Joseph The Idol). \n \nThe women of this group have businesses that include selling food, wood, clothing or household goods.  There is also a dressmaker and a small store.  These are poor women with a great desire to better their lives and the lives of their families.  They now have the opportunity to do this by upgrading their businesses and increasing their profits with the help of Namaste\u2019s business advisors and money management classes.\n\nAngela (3rd from left) is 64 and does not know how to read or write.  She has a life partner but she is the only one contributing to the house and business.  She has had her store for about ten years.  Unfortunately, four years ago a car ran over her leg and she almost lost her foot.  She was not able to work for two years, during which time her partner took care of the store for her.  However, without her guidance the store did not do as well and her profits went way down.  With her loan, she wants to buy what she needs to stock her store with things her customers want.  She can then bring her sales to the level where she had them before the accident.  She currently has a monthly profit of around US $117, working 140 hours a month.

After the death of her husband, she has been raising their 4 children and running the household on her own.  Churek has secondary specialized education.  Her family's main source of income is raising of livestock, a business that she started 10 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS.

provide socio-economic support to each other. As a result, the group established a merry-go round where they would provide micro loans and emergency loans to its members. Joseph, on the far right, is a single father raising a child with the help of his parents. He has successfully completed training on life skills, and he hopes to use the loan in starting a poultry business. The group was identified by Junior Achievement and they are currently undergoing an entrepreneurship program with the objective of building their capacity to grow and expand their businesses. Through market research the group has seen the opportunity for selling eggs and chickens in the community and have already constructed a brooder for their venture. Through mentoring from Junior Achievement, the group will be able to embark on a poultry business and be successful, given the demand for the product and the newly acquired business skills that the members of the group have."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy
