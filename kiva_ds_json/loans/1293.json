We are with my wife in this activity; otherwise by myself would have been almost impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\nDritan has been photographed in front of his house and with an agricultural type of vehicle that he\u2019s been using in his work.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1508618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AL","country":"Albania","town":"Elbasan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 20","type":"point"}},"partner_id":239,"posted_date":"2014-01-10T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T03:50:07Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dritan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ALL","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7500},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":5900},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6200},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6700},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6300},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6800},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6600},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7100},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7300},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7300},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7600},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":7700},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7700},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8300},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8200},{"due_date":"2015-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8300},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8600},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8800},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8900},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9100},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9500},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9800},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10300},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10500},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":10700},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11000},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.14},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.99},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.81},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.72},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.27},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.7},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T01:08:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":655767,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary lives in Paynesville in one of the populated area in Montserrado County.

She offers her customers diverse products, such as rice, sugar, cereals, canned goods and more for making meals. Among her main customers are her neighbors and townspeople who go to her store from the early morning hours, because after that they go to their land to care for their crops. She usually gets her merchandise wholesale since that way she gets much lower prices. Over time, she wants to keep improving her business to obtain better income. One of her main objectives is to build a home out of brick to keep her business in the best condition. This is the first loan that she has asked for from Kiva and she hopes to get the support she needs to keep going forward. She wants this opportunity to have 1,000 nuevos soles to buy merchandise wholesale such as cereals, rice, sugar, pasta and more, hoping to stock her business and keep it supplied. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1489593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy edible products such as cereals, rice, sugar, pasta and more.

He is married, with six children. He is 48 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last ten years to support his family. Julius is also known as Pastor. In addition to this, Julius is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group.  He described his harvest last year as being good.

He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and he has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, and earn enough money to feed his family. As an active member in his community, Julius also chose to be a group leader and a Kiva representative because he is an active community member, he wants to help more farmers, and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Julius plans on using the future profits from the harvest to send his children to school and to buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest, he has more farm training, he was able to save money, and he was able to feed the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nJulius and the Abangonya Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers, as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase his harvest of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":5400,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otwero","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eshituku","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":465363,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465363}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644137,"name":"Shezian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shezian is a 26-year-old married woman who is the mother of two children.

Competition is not a problem; her customers have plenty of options but in the end they go for the best product and hers is one of the favourites because of its size, flavour and healthy condition.\r\n\r\nIn the future Sulma plans to build her own house where she can live with her partner, since they currently live under the same roof as her parents. Her dream is to increase the use of technology and look after her crops well, to extend them and grow a different variety from the one she grows currently to offer to her customers.\r\n\r\nSulma has asked the COMIXMUL cooperative for a loan which will be used to pay for labour for picking the coffee beans and cleaning and washing the crop, as well as clearing weeds from the property. She is hoping for the support of this loan since she is a young woman who wants to improve herself and do well in life, and to contribute to the household with her family and others so that later on she will be able to fulfil her goals and dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1489601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for labour to pick the coffee beans and clear the property of weeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Barbara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.083333 -88.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T16:50:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulma Yoselin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T01:03:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656017,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is a hard-working entrepreneur who earns a living by farming rice and raising pigs in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 25,000 through Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc.

The village is about 4 and 1\/2 kms from the district town and one has to pay rs.20 to the auto rickshaw driver as the fare to reach the village.

She usually gets the supplies from the town or at the capital market. The generated income is small and insufficient to manage the family expenses and also to stock a large variety of supplies.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase more cereals, first aid kits and drugs for common illnesses like coughs, diarrhea, and fever.

Como desventaja en este rubro son las diferentes enfermedades y bichos que afectan los cultivos los cuales al no dar asistencia quedan expuestas y pueden ser perjudicados.\nPor lo que hoy en d\u00eda ella solicita financiamiento a la cooperativa COMIXMUL para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas y semilla de papa certificada misma que ser\u00e1 sembrada y cultivada ya que de esa manera ella podr\u00e1 extender sus cultivos y generar mayores ganancias. \nSu sue\u00f1o es que sus hijos estudien y sean personas profesionales en la vida que tengan mejores oportunidades y mayores formas de generar sus ingresos para el sustento de sus familias ya que la mejor herencia que a un hijo se le puede dar es la educaci\u00f3n, principios y valores.\n","en":"Manuela, age 33, is a female farmer and housewife.  She is married and the mother of three children.  Her two older children are independent and only her six-year-old child is dependent on her.  Manuela completed her elementary school education thanks to the financial and moral support of her parents.  She is very appreciative, but she was not able to continue her studies due to a lack of financial resources and growing up in a modest family.  \r\n\r\nFor the past eight years, Manuela and her partner have worked together in their business.  She is very grateful to God for the different customers she has encountered during her time as a farmer.  As a result, she was able to build a modest house where she can have small family get-togethers and also a place to prepare tamales and sell food as a way of generating more income.  Her land was acquired through a purchase.  \r\n\r\nA disadvantage of this line of work is having to deal with different diseases and pests that affect crops, so she must do whatever she can to prevent exposing her crops and sustaining damage.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from the COMIXMUL cooperative in order to buy farming supplies and certified seed potatoes that she can plant and cultivate.  This will enable her to extend her crop and generate more income.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children study so that they can become professionals, which will provide them with better opportunities in life and the ability to generate more income to support their families.  The best inheritance that she can leave to her child consists of education, principles, and values.

The solar package enables her to charge mobile phones and to use a small radio as well as to save on buying kerosene. The jikos (economical cooking stoves) save at least 50 percent of the firewood and the charcoal consumption compared to what she was using before, therefore easing the burden of buying charcoal and collecting firewood daily. The cook stove also reduces smoke emissions, making it better for her health.\r\nSeeing an opportunity, Elizabeth decided to be an entrepreneur by being a distributor for solars and jikos. She approached VEP for financing and received a credit facility that enabled her to purchase small solar systems and jikos to sell to other women in women groups.

","en":"Lobar was born in 1990.  She is married and is raising three children.  Lobar is a smart young woman, who completed the Pedagogical College.  Currently, she is working in a high school.  Lobar wishes to obtain a university-level education and to advance further in her current career.  Driven by this goal, she enrolled into the Pedagogical University to take night classes.

Meerim has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 2 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Meerim's hard work, today her business contains 1 horse and 4 tons of potatoes.  Meerim leases a 1.0 hectare plot of land, where she plants potatoes, wheat, barley and sainfoin.

She and her husband have one son who was born this year. Manzuura married Ramil right after finishing school, so she wasn't able to get a higher education. \r\n\r\nManzuura has a high school education and now farms and raises livestock to provide the family's main income. She started four years ago by buying cattle for 5,000 KGS. Due to her hard work, she now has two dairy cows, two calves and 20 sheep. At the same time, Manzuura farms 1.8 hectares on which she grows beans and clover. Her husband helps her, along with her mother-in-law who lives with them. \r\n\r\nTo care for her animals, Manzuura hires a veterinarian twice a year. She has her cattle at home where she has the needed set-up for them. Only in season does she take them to the cattle pasture. She gets income from milk sales and from farming. Her monthly income is 11,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Manzuura would like to take a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy a heifer for cattle breeding. She plans to use the profits to invest in further increasing her herd and save to repair her house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1488329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a heifer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-11T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzuura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2255},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2323},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2392},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2464},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2538},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2614},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2693},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2773},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2857},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2942},{"due_date":"2014-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3031},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-12T17:00:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":644141,"name":"Robina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robina is a 26-year-old, married woman and the mother of three children.

Since childhood, he has has an affinity for making handicrafts. He collected things that others had thrown away and made them into useful, decorative objects to sell to family and acquaintances. With time, he became responsible for supporting his family, as he had a son at a young age. So he looked for a job that would provide steady income to pay for his family's needs.

Merab runs an agricultural business harvesting nuts and kiwi. The products are sold locally and he gets a small income from this activity. Now Merab wants to start another activity that will increase the family's income and be more stable. The startup program that is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo enabled him to get a loan of $4,000 for purchasing a secondhand car. Merab will serve the local people as a taxi driver and transport them intercity. He is a very enthusiastic and hard working person with a great desire to ensure his family has a good life.

This loan would help her to pay the tuition fees, to purchase education equipment like books, notebooks, pens, pencil etc. and to pay private coaching fees for her son\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nArchana and Biman (in the photo) are very thankful to BJS and Kiva for this educational loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay tuition fees, private coaching fees and other school expenses for her son.

She is a courageous housewife and blessed with one daughter. She lives with her husband in a small mud house. Her husband sells betel nuts (they are used as a mouth freshener) in the local bazaar. His income is so small that they cannot even afford the educational expenses of her daughter. Chaya and her husband decided to discontinue her daughter\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, one fine day Chaya met with a Credit officer from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and came to know that BJS gives loans to poor women to educate their children. She decided to take a loan from BJS for her daughter\u2019s education so that her daughter can continue her studies. With this loan, she will pay the school fees and buy school dresses and other necessary study materials like books, notebooks, pen, pencils, for her daughter\u2019s schooling.\r\n\r\nNow Chaya is very ambitious for her daughter and quite relaxed about her daughter\u2019s education as BJS and Kiva came forward to help her financially to secure her daughter\u2019s future. Chaya and her daughter (shown in the photo) give hearty thanks to Kiva and BJS for this educational loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1509154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay school fees and buy school dresses and study materials for her daughter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2014-01-10T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-09T19:30:07Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-10T21:28:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
