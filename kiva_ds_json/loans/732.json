Like his fellow drivers, he drives around his town looking for more customers. What he likes the most about his job is that the people who get to know him confide in him and ask him for his services.

For this reason he hopes for your help in order to put his plans into practice. This will be his first loan with MFP, and he commits to complying with the repayment of his dues.

She began her business because she was receiving a very low income from the hairdressing she was doing, so she decided to create an additional source of income. Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she earns about 1,000,000 Sierra Leone Leones (Le) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Namisa requires a loan in order to buy more provisions and drinks for her business. In the future, Namisa plans to develop her business to the point of a full-scale provision shop and to become a distributor for breweries and cold storage companies; she also plans to educate her children very well. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":936182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more provisions and drinks for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Freetown East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-12-05T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721844,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124763,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505669,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974775,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815342,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444399,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537124,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284612,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338194,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":301000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T22:15:56Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366839,"name":"Alberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alberto is 53 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She buys coconut from different farmers in nearby provinces and delivers it to her regular customers, the coconut retailers, who sell the coconut per piece or use it in their own business. She also manages a small variety store for added income. She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of the coconut needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMaria Ligaya hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes that her children will finish their studies up to college. She also dreams of buying a vehicle to be used in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,600,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 4,500,000 leones. Kadiatu has already received and successfully repaid her first loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy garri, bulgar, beans, and groundnuts for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 350,000 leones.

Her sales point is alongside a highway.  It\u2019s a honey producing zone and the sale of rosquillas [ring-shaped cookies], candy and stone extraction is very typical here.  People pass by the place and buy these products because they are less expensive.  She also goes to the community of Tela where she has a large number of customers that buy Rosquillas, candied fruit and candy from her.  The paving stones are used to build walls or decorative fences on dwellings.  She buys them at one price and then sells them at another producing good profit for her.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and she requested it to invest in her business.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five-Philippine pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMaria Nenita hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which covers her costs each day. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nApolonia dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nCuriously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In 2007, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Ryskul started up her business in cattle breeding. Using a starting sum of 40,000 som (KGS), Ryskul was able to start a farm, which now has two milking cows, two heifers, one horse. It yields around 20,000 som (KGS) a month from selling dairy products and meat. In order to further develop her business, Ryskul turned to the company \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle. In the future, Ryskul plans to repair her house.

Seeking a way to provide for her family, Gulzara, with the support of her father, is starting her own business raising livestock. Utilizing a starting capital of 30,000 som (KGS), Gulzara has managed to earn a profit of 2,000 som (KGS) this month from selling milk. In addition, Gulzara is selling baked goods, such as pastries and cookies, that she makes at home. This also adds a little income to the family budget. \r\n\r\nHoping to further grow her business, Gulzara has asked Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and dairy cows. In the future, Gulzara plans to expand her business so that she is able to get her children an education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":937682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ala-Buka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-08T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":728.32,"local_amount":33875.39,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938381,"comment":null},{"amount":346.68,"local_amount":16124.61,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16188.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070915,"comment":null},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50199.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426579,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-09T06:27:26Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:10:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367111,"name":"Akech","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akech is a 28-year-old married woman with two children.

Her husband is a fireman. Taking into account her husband's low wages and looking for a supplemental income source for her family, in 2008 Fariza started her own business in livestock husbandry.  After an initial investment of 15,000 KGS, Fariza earns 20,000 KGS per month in income from selling milk and dairy products. In order to further develop her business, Fariza came to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase additional livestock. In the near future Fariza is hoping to buy home appliances and fix up her

is a coconut supplier in Mombasa, Kenya.

Six years ago, Nathaniel sold one of his cattle to raise the capital required to start the business, but it was not sufficient to run the business. \r\n\r\nSince being introduced to Milango, he has decided to apply for a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase more coconuts to sell.
