This group of women trade in various items such as fruit and vegetables, cosmetics and others.  \r\n\r\nTo improve the scale of their businesses, the members of Djekafo have decided to request a loan from the field partner Soro Yiriwaso. This will be the first loan for this group.  \r\n\r\nDjenebou (second person from the right) only sells cosmetics.  She will use her loan to buy boxes of creams, perfumes, toilet soaps, pomades, lotions and nail varnish.  She buys these products in bulk in Koutiala, from the Yoruba people.  Djenebou makes retail and cash sales from her home, and at the market.  She has a diverse range of customers.  \r\n\r\nWhilst the other members of the group hope to make an average profit of 62,000 francs CFA each during this period, Djenebou expects to make 70,000 francs CFA.  As well as repaying their  loans, they will use part of their profits to fund their day-to-day, personal expenses, and increase their stock levels.

Financed from personal funds, Gary expanded his business and was recently able to purchase office space for production with hopes to break through Baton Rouge boundaries and connect to readers outside his town.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of The Rouge Collection is to share photos and articles that highlight everything positive happening in Baton Rouge along with the people behind the positive events and include places worth visiting. Gary\u2019s new goal is to receive articles from fresh writers with fresh perspectives, ideas and concepts to shape the future of the mag. \r\n\r\nCurrently, The Rouge Collection is in high demand for samples and orders but, due to lack of equipment and supplies, Gary is unable to execute large orders and sample requests. Failure to complete orders could result in closing the business. As new as his business is, it was no surprise to Gary that he would eventually need financial assistance. A quick Internet search introduced him to Accion Texas Inc., a nonprofit microlender with America\u2019s largest lending portfolio, and ended his worries. Once approved, Gary set out to purchase office equipment to print product samples.\r\n\r\nWith his recent loan, the 28-year-old was able to continue his service to his hometown, keep his four part-time sales employees, and continue to educate his readers on relationships, health and fitness, style and beauty, entertainment and sports.

The alternate to smoking regular cigarettes, vaporizing allows a smoker to enjoy the vapors of an e-cigarette and avoid the multitude of harsh chemicals and potential life-threatening side effects of traditional cigarettes. \r\n\r\nAs stated on his site, http:\/\/www.zooksvapor.com\/, Todd says: \u201cI have always wanted to go into business for myself, and now I am able to do that and help others along the way! The more you get to know me, (the more) you will understand how passionate I am about this!\u201d \r\n\r\nTodd says his family history of health issues increased his need to discontinue use of traditional cigarettes and find a new outlet. Once he made the switch to vaping and experienced the difference, Todd began spreading the word. He noticed he could make a business out of the work he was already doing. Realizing the need for inexpensive, high-quality vapor supplies and accessories in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, Todd went to work opening Zooks Vapor.\r\n\r\nBeginning his business seven months ago from his own money, Todd hopes to one day open a store and attract more customers and hire a team instead of working alone. Before he can accomplish his next goal, Todd ventured to community partner SCORE, which then referred him to nonprofit microlender Accion Texas Inc.

And he could earn maximum profit so they can spend their old ages with peace and calm.\r\n\r\nHafeez Begum is very pleased after taking this loan and thankful to the BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.99,"image":{"id":1434880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy billy goats to sell before Eid.

Ishfaq repairs such types of accessories and resells them at high prices. In this way he gets high prices in his scrap dealing business.

Through this practice he can easily find repairable doors and windows for resale.\r\n\r\nA few months ago his elder daughter was married and he spent a lot of money over her dowry. Recently, he found a house under construction and the owner is selling the iron goods, but he does not have sufficient amounts to buy the scrap iron.

However, her salary of a nurse is not even close to covering the family's basic needs. To be able to take care of her large family's needs, Alvard is engaged in cultivation of wheat, walnuts, and some fruits, including peaches, apricots, plums, quinces, pomegranates, pears, and apples. Her family helps her a lot in running the agribusiness; her sons and husband help her in selling the products in the local market.

The oldest son is a college student, and the rest are in school. Atirgul's husband helps around the house, and his source of income is his taxi business. \r\n\r\nAtirgul's main source of income is a cafe which she opened two years ago with 15,000 KGS. The menu mainly consists of national dishes. Thanks to her hard work, Atirgul was able to develop her business and attract regular customers. She loves her work and enjoys making the food. According to her customers, the food is delicious and there are many choices.  In order to further expand her business, Atirgul is applying for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners in order to buy additional products for her cafe and to diversify the menu. Atirgul plans to invest any profits resulting from this loan into her business, and wants to save enough money to educate her oldest son, who just started medical school this year in the state university."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":462.21,"image":{"id":1440312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products, to diversify the menu in the cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uchar village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-26T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-26T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atirgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7468},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":7297},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":7510},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":7729},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":7954},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8186},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8425},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8671},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8924},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9184},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9452},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":9200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.17},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":154.96,"local_amount":7468,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7555.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777242,"comment":null},{"amount":151.41,"local_amount":7297,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":7382.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427090,"comment":null},{"amount":155.84,"local_amount":7510,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":7597.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942635,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T13:07:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609757,"name":"Leonena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonena is 44 years old, married, with five children, one of whom is in school.

Mrs Mariam was quickly interested in commercial activity, in particular related to the sale of d\u00e9gu\u00e9 [a local Malian drink made from millet, a common african cereal] and small articles. She is very often solicited at the market, notably during the main market days. Building on her experiences in this domain, she is collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso to enlarge her business in order to better satisfy her growing customer base, by asking for her second loan, after having correctly reimbursed the first one.\r\n\r\nMariam plans to use this loan to purchase cereals, sugar and milk. She stocks up at the wholesalers in the market. She sells her merchandise individually for cash to families as well as during market day, to a customer base composed of both men and women.

This is the region with coffee, tea, and dairy farming. Its also the region that has had a lot of problems with deforestation, hence there have been water shortages in the recent years. Lilian is no exception from the millions of women who use wood and dung fuels for cooking and kerosene for lighting. Their income levels can not enable them to install and sustain electricity energy. The situation is not easy now that the forests are reserved and therefore getting wood is becoming harder. Like her neighbors, she has to suffer every weekend walking up and down the hills to go fetch water and collect wood to last her a week so that she can till the land during weekdays.\r\n\r\nLilian learned about VEP and the biogas project during a training at her church, and determined to resolve the fuel issue she approached VEP to help her construct one at her home. She has received a biogas loan and started the life-changing project that will see her and her family become empowered with cleaner, cheaper, and more efficient fuel. This will also save her one day in her weekends to rest and be with her children. The biogas will also supply her with light so she will not need to buy kerosene anymore. This will be good for her children who need to study in the evening and can now enjoy more study hours. We believe this will improve their grades. With the monthly income from tea and the sale of milk from her three cows, Lilian will be able to repay the loan, and once she clears she hopes to purchase a water tank to store rainwater and solve her water problem as well.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.76,"image":{"id":1435128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To construct a bio-digester","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-09-26T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-26T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian Njeri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4167},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4159}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8390.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639971,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":4167,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4195.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867624,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T11:05:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609855,"name":"Teing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teing is 35 years old and married.

knows challenges and will never be afraid to face them. While everyone told her she is out to fail with her project, she kept working harder and harder until she proved them wrong.\n\nRana is a 35 years old Iraqi woman, she is married and a mother of 3 children. Five years ago her husband was paralyzed and since then she is the sole provider for the family. Facing a tough situation others might not have been able to handle, Rana took matters into her own hand.\n\nUsing the small land they had, she had a store built which was gradually filled with various goods. With great intuition about supply and demand, she purchased items for retail her customers could only buy in different towns before. With 5 years experience and a well built reputation, she is now able to attract many customers and carry many items from basic household goods to clothing and accessories for every member of the family.\n\nHer growing business qualifies for the WLIFT program as Rana is taking a SME loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount 12,500 USD. Rana plans to use the loan to improve the current store and also to add small electrical appliances to her current stock.\n\nRana is confident, and her strong personality and persistence to succeed will surely help her succeed  She is not only growing into a respected local business woman but also is a great role-model for success to her children and other women in her area. \n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":10375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1440344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to improve the current store and also to add small electrical appliances to her current stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-09-26T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-26T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":12500,"lender_count":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":12500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":702},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":702},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":694}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609840,"name":"Lavalenesi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lavalenesi is 41 years old and married with seven children.

She is 34 years old and has three children to take care of. Her business, which she has had for 12 years, has enabled her to generate almost 32,000 KHR per day. With this new loan, Mom will be a fifth-time borrower whereas her co-borrower will be a six-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). The positive impact of Mom's past loans has enabled her to repay her loans and to support her living better than before, especially in purchasing household appliances and three meals a day for her family.

She is a farmer and a business lady operating a small shop next to her house. She joined VEP in 2012, and since that time she has been able to benefit from renewable energy, having bought her first solar lamp and cleared her debt. Happily, she shares with us how much she has enjoyed life while using a solar lantern that helped her save at least 50% of the money she previously used on kerosene. The lamp she bought could be used in the sitting room for her children to study, during dinner and for the master bedroom. She would then only need to buy a little kerosene for her kitchen lantern, which the children would also use in their bedroom. \r\n\r\nFor this loan, she would like to take a solar package that comes with four lights so she can have light in every room, charge mobile phones and power their small radio. The other older lamp can then be used in the shop to serve the evening customers instead of using a candle. This way she can open her shop for longer hours. With the package she will not have to buy kerosene anymore or pay to have her phone charged. This means a lot of savings for her and convenience for her family.

She started buying and reselling cattle three years ago and continues to grow cattle for future resale. She is from the Zafarobod region. A large part of the residents in the region do animal husbandry and grow cattle and produce milk. At this time Shahlo only has one milk cow and a calf. She wants to use the loan money to buy a couple of calves and increase the headcount of livestock. Shahlo is positive that everything will come out alright because her son and husband always help her.

in the regions and villages the main type of business is livestock breeding and crop cultivation. Young people have to leave their native cities, villages and regions to, in order to feed their family and support the native people financially. And to them all, it is not easy to be far away from their native land and soul. \r\n\r\nSalohiddin loves his family so much that he was not able to travel far, even though work is hard and they pay is small in his native country. It is not strange, as he can be near his family. Salohiddin is 30 years old and works as a farmer. The work in the field is hard, but he does not complain. Salohiddin's wife helps him.
