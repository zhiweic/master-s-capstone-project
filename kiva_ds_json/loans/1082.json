Avec une telle exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine, il jouit d\u2019une parfaite confiance de la famille des tailleurs ce qui lui a valu la pr\u00e9sidence du Comit\u00e9 de Surveillance de l\u2019Association des Tailleurs de Sikasso (A.T.S.). En plus de la couture, il ach\u00e8te des machines \u00e0 coudre \u00e0 Lom\u00e9 (r\u00e9publique de Togo) et des tissus pour homme afin de les revendre aux tailleurs de Sikasso. Dans le souci de mieux satisfaire des commandes de plus en plus croissantes, il sollicite ainsi ce quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso avec laquelle il est en partenariat il y environ quatre ann\u00e9es. Ce nouveau cr\u00e9dit lui permettra d\u2019acheter 15 machines \u00e0 coudre et accessoires et 30 complets tissus.\nAvec ce pr\u00eat, il envisage r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mensuel de 300 000 FCFA. Avec ces b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9alis\u00e9s, il compte r\u00e9soudre l\u2019essentielle de ses d\u00e9penses personnelles, contribuer aux d\u00e9penses familiales, payer les int\u00e9r\u00eats de son pr\u00eat et investir le reste dans son atelier. \n","en":"Almoudou is over 46 years old.  He is married and the father of four daughters.  He lives with his family in M\u00e9dine, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAlmoudou did not have the opportunity to progress far in his studies.  Instead, he quickly learned to sew from his uncle, in Sikasso.  He has now been working as a tailor for more than 30 years.  His shop is located at the Grand Market in Sikasso, and most of his customers are male stallholders.  Thanks to his vast experience in his field of work, he is held in high esteem by other tailors and he is the president of the Supervisory Committee of the A.T.S. (Association des Tailleurs de Sikasso), the Sikasso Tailors' Association.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to his job as a tailor, Almoudou also buys sewing machines in Lom\u00e9 (republic of Togo), as well as fabrics for men, which he resells to other tailors in Sikasso.\r\n\r\nEager to meet the increasing number of orders he receives, he is requesting this fourth loan from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which he has collaborated for about four years.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will allow him to buy 15 sewing machines and accessories and 30 pieces of fabrics, each measuring 1 x 3 meters.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Almoudou is expecting monthly profits to reach 300,000 CFA francs, which will help him to cover most of his personal expenses, to contribute to his family's expenses and pay off his loan's interest.  He will reinvest the rest of his money in his shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1318244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy some sewing machines and fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Almoudou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126606.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819577,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126606.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207335,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":126606.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T11:06:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540061,"name":"Nabweru Development Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is 35 years old, a resident of Nabweru, and a member of Nabweru Development Group.

He has two children and a wife. He is the sole supporter of his family. Currently he is trading some household items, like washing powder and soaps, which are used in every home. But, due to lack of a proper display space and shop, he works from his home. Because his selling is home-based, he doesn't have enough customers. \r\n\r\nNow he has requested a loan amount of PKR 120,000 in order to purchase a shop, so he can start a proper retail business.

is 54 years old from a small village of Kobuleti district. She has a large family: a husband, three sons, a daughter-in-law, an infant granddaughter and her parents-in-law. Ketevan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but had no success. Her loan request was always rejected, because of her low income and her family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nUntil recently, the only source of the income for the family was from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow different kinds of vegetables, which are sold locally in open markets. In addition she has newly started a business where she buys and sells clothing. But still, it is hardly enough to buy food for her family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKetevan requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions available to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Ketevan will purchase more clothing to sell. She will be able to expand her business and this will increase the income of the family.

Grace hopes that in the future she will be able to add to the business. \n\nGrace is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Grace who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":621.96,"image":{"id":1306842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to stock more g-nuts (peanuts) and dry maize to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Fort Portal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136112},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141028},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146122},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151400},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156868},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":162534},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":168405},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":174487},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":180790},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":187320},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":194085},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":200849}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.74,"local_amount":136112,"processed_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":139597.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355772728,"comment":null},{"amount":54.65,"local_amount":141028,"processed_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-22T08:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":144639.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364880021,"comment":null},{"amount":56.62,"local_amount":146122,"processed_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T08:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":149864.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372885739,"comment":null},{"amount":58.67,"local_amount":151400,"processed_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":155277.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381908221,"comment":null},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":156868,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":160885.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391396502,"comment":null},{"amount":62.98,"local_amount":162534,"processed_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":166696.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399776080,"comment":null},{"amount":65.26,"local_amount":168405,"processed_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172718.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411560339,"comment":null},{"amount":67.61,"local_amount":174487,"processed_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":178955.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420923261,"comment":null},{"amount":70.06,"local_amount":180790,"processed_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":185420.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429469885,"comment":null},{"amount":72.58,"local_amount":187320,"processed_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":192117.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440155623,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T19:42:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534981,"name":"Darlison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Darlison is 30 years old and lives in the town of Kijura in the Hoima region of Uganda.

This is hardly enough to provide food food for the family. According to Credo\u2019s evaluations, this family belongs to the category of the subsistence poor. Nino applied for a loan from Credo to start up her family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-start credits on \u201csoft\u201d conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d based on their low income levels.

The primary occupation of her family is raising cattle and growing crops. In 2009, Narynkul decided to expand her business by getting into fattening and selling cattle, investing 10,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to make her first purchase of cows.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnnaliza operates a buy-and-sell business. What she basically does is buy scrap garments from a textile factory and sells them with a little profit. Her products are used in making rugs and doormats. Customers are attracted to buy, due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are rug-makers from her local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Annaliza is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy additional stocks of textile items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnnaliza dreams of having more sewing machines and hopes to have their own house and lot. She meets up every week with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The harvested wheat is sold at the local markets. In addition, Sarkis is working as a security guard and gets paid a small monthly salary.\r\n\r\nSarkis requested a loan from Credo for his start-up family business. His loan request was approved by the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing credit and soft repayment conditions to the country's rural poor to allow them to fund their start-up businesses.  The rural poor do not have access to credit since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nSarkis will use the loan to purchase calves. He will raise the calves and later sell dairy products at the local markets. This will significantly increase his family's income.

","en":"Arzygul is 48 years old and the mother of four children--two school-aged students, and two in university.  While searching for a source of income for her family 18 years ago, she started her own farming and livestock business.  Thanks to her hard work, Arzygul today has 2 head of cattle, 1 calf and 1 horse.  The revenue from the sale of milk, dairy products and selling animals is around 12,000.  She also plants 2.12 hectares of land where she grows beans and potatoes.  With the goal of further developing her business, Arzygul has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 120,000 to buy 3 dairy cows to increase her income from milk sales.  She plans to use the income from the loan to increase her herd and to pay for her children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1367.71,"image":{"id":1317322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 3 cows ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Arashan village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arzygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458970,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863107,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-30T08:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631637,"comment":null},{"amount":105.2,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495541,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743772,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013994,"comment":null},{"amount":105.21,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5038.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777059,"comment":null},{"amount":420.83,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":20155.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426869,"comment":null},{"amount":210.42,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10077.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942465,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T14:05:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541062,"name":"Denis Alexander","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Denis, solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito  porque necesita m\u00e1s capital de trabajo y por la buen atenci\u00f3n que la institucion  le proporciona.

Eva will use the 1,500 soles to buy organic manure to nourish her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1318517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.77},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":169.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.3},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":192.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":201},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":211.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":219.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":58.71,"local_amount":146.77,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":152.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578016,"comment":null},{"amount":67.79,"local_amount":169.48,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":175.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530245,"comment":null},{"amount":70.12,"local_amount":175.3,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":181.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975275,"comment":null},{"amount":74,"local_amount":185,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":192.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996541,"comment":null},{"amount":76.83,"local_amount":192.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":199.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864023,"comment":null},{"amount":80.4,"local_amount":201,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":208.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352367,"comment":null},{"amount":84.41,"local_amount":211.02,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":219.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904253,"comment":null},{"amount":87.74,"local_amount":219.36,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":227.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-22T19:44:08Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541067,"name":"Carlos Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"CARLOS  tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero no tiene hijos vive con los padres en Chillanes provincia de Bol\u00edvar.\n\nPertenece a la VRC SAN JUAN BAUTISTA se encuentra formada y creada en la ciudad de Tambanal a una distancia de 40 minutos de la oficina de la cooperatva, La actividad econ\u00f3mica es la agricultura, crianza de animales.\n\nCARLOS se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, fr\u00e9jol,adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de ganado y cerdos.\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar un ganado, vacuna y alimentaci\u00f3n.

Credo approved his loan request, in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Robert will purchase a truck, with which he will start trading in potatoes.

The couple is raising three children, all of whom live in and are currently enrolled in school. The family manages a four-acre cacao farm with around 1,200 trees. \n\nA cacao farmer of 27 years now, Julio says he enjoys every part of the process of farming cacao. A more challenging part of cacao for him is the fermentation and drying, especially in the rainy season. Belize has two seasons \u2013 rainy and dry \u2013 with the rainy season typically going from June to November. The Toledo district receives most rainfall of all of Belize. Moreover, with climate change, the seasonality has become less predictable, with rains occurring in the dry season and vice versa. The family is happy to now be able to sell fresh cacao in place of having to dry it themselves. \n\nFlorentina has been an active participant in farm management. She oversees and organizes harvesting with other ladies in her village, hiring three women to help with harvesting every two weeks during the productive season. Cacao trees in Belize produce all year round, with peak seasons from February through May. Besides caring for the children and helping on the farm, Florentina makes local Maya crafts from woven Jippi Jappa palm leaves. \n\nIn the future, the family hopes to continue improving their cacao farm by expanding and diversifying into other crops that can be planted alongside the cacao trees. An interplanted farm yields some kind of crop all year round, creating more stable income for the farmers. Ideally, the children will finish school and take over the farm. \u201cIf they want, it would nice if they could continue to run the farm business, if not, somebody will take care of it,\u201d Julio told Maya Mountain Cacao laughingly. \n\nThe family is requesting this loan to prepare for expanding their farm and to hire help for harvesting. Expanding cacao requires buying and filling bags with topsoil and seeds in order to raise cacao seedlings. Moreover, to prepare land for planting, farmers need to clean the underbrush and mark where the trees will be planted. Seedlings are ready for transplanting into the ground when they have four or more leaves, usually about six months after they are bagged. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":145.85,"image":{"id":1318838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean and expand cacao farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":83.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751707,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993447,"comment":null},{"amount":20.81,"local_amount":41.62,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":42.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255616,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":41.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":42.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136456,"comment":null},{"amount":20.81,"local_amount":41.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":42.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900672,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088552,"comment":null},{"amount":0.05,"local_amount":0.06,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":0.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440202043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T00:31:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541771,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonio, 52, and his wife live in the village of San Antonio, on the under way highway that will connect southern Belize with Guatemala. The family, besides managing 3 acres of cacao, has raised 10 children, five of whom live in at the moment. The children are aged nine to 30, and two of them are still enrolled in school. The older kids have moved out, and some of them have followed their dad\u2019s example and begun their own cacao farms. \n\nWith the help of his wife, Antonio tends to around 1,300 cacao trees that were planted five years back with the help of a local association of cacao growers. Cacao trees typically take about four to five years to become productive, and the family is happy most of their hard work five years ago is now paying back. Antonio says cacao farming is no trouble once the trees are grown and producing. The hardest thing about cacao for Antonio is the two-year period right after planting new trees. \u201cYou have to clean it often, not let the bush cover it, because the branches don\u2019t make it through the bush,\u201d he told Maya Mountain Cacao in perfect English, his second language after the native Maya Mopan language spoken in the village.\n\nBesides cacao, the family grows corn and beans for home use. The two main sources of income for Antonio is a job as security officer for a local airline and cacao. In the future, he hopes to retire from the side job and focus on the farm and possibly expand it. The family puts a lot of focus on providing their children with the opportunity of education. \u201cI put my other three boys to school even without me having a job,\u201d said Antonio, adding that cacao and his job have helped save enough to put the rest of the children through school if they want to. \n\nAntonio is requesting this loan to hire help with cleaning the three acres of cacao. Cleaning is the process of cutting underbrush surrounding cacao trees to clear access to them for harvesting and pruning. Cacao requires shade, and is typically grown among timber trees and underbrush. To keep their farms manageable, cacao farmers in southern Belize clean their fields about three times in a given year. The job at hand for Antonio will require and create about 12 days worth of work in the community. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.17,"image":{"id":1319630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Clean three acres of cacao.

He hopes that the future loan will be invested in opening a shop for his wife instead of working from home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1245,"image":{"id":1317306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to start a new business for his wife","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Nabatieh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-03-22T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-21T23:10:06Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355736040,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441438,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846666,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614896,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472398,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728490,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997420,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762026,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412114,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630107,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T01:10:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540272,"name":"Zahara's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahara's group is comprised of 7 hard working women.

He lives in the Marneuli District with his wife, Ina, and two sons: 25-year-old, Guram, and 14-year-old, Otar, and they all go to school. Paata requested a loan from some local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of having a low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nPaata is an artisan. He is working on some private-order renovations. In addition his older son, Guram, is a distributor, and they both get a small monthly income that is not enough to feed the family. \r\n\r\nPaata requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Paata plans to open a restaurant. As he has a commercial space, Paata will not have to pay the rent. He will only need to purchase some materials for the renovation, which will be done by him. This will reduce the cost, increase his profit, and Paata will have a source of income. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of his family.

In addition, his family has seasonal income from renting rooms.\r\n\r\nVitali requested a loan from Credo to start a family business.

lives in an agricultural area, in a village far away from the city.  He is married and is raising three children.  He has twelve years of experience in raising livestock.  His father raised livestock and Gulom helped his father since his childhood.  They had one calf that he had to take care of.  He grew up and followed in his father's footsteps.  He started his business with two sheep.  At first he had a hard time, especially in wintertime he had to spend more for livestock feed.  But over time experience proved valuable and Gulom started finding ways to overcome barriers and ways to better expand his business.  Today he has more than 50 heads of livestock.  His wife and three children also take part in the business.  Due to the season he does not want to sell his cows right now, because their prices fell.  Gulom needs additional resources to buy livestock feed.  With this goal he turned to MDO Arvand for a loan.  He plans to use the loan to buy livestock feed.

It is the first funding he has sought with the Foundation of Mario Santo Domingo which he requires to be able to produce living room, dining room, and bedroom sets, as well as doors and closets.  Javier is a married man and father of three grown children that organized his own cabinet-making workshop in the patio of his home.  This also functions as a small storeroom for his wife's miscellaneous items.  He learned this cabinetry work when he was very young, as his father also did woodworking.

The 12 of them, 10 women and 2 men, are farmers in Kakamega North District. Farming inputs will be delivered to him on credit consisting of the necessary materials to plant \u00bd acre of millet and sorghum. Justus joined One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2013 season. Justus joined One Acre Fund so that he could access the best input prices and grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining One Acre Fund, Justus was only able to harvest three bags of maize per acre, but after joining One Acre Fund during the Long Rains 2012, he was able to harvest five bags per acre!

He is a caring father of five children and a loving husband.  For the last 25 years, from his early childhood, he has worked as a rancher.  His grandfather and father were butchers.  Shamsiddin continues on in the footsteps and also became a butcher.  This allows him to earn extra income.  Since he has a large family, he needs to have multiple sources of income.  He skillfully combines breeding, butchery, and farming activities. Basically, he breeds, raises and sells cattle.  This is his main source of income that provides for his family, his children's education and general living expenses.  Shamsiddin and his wife try also to set aside for their children's univeristy tuition.  Using his experience and seasoned skills, he would like to buy an additional cow and feed for his cattle.  But he doesn't not want to use his savings since it will be difficult to rebuild them.  He turned to Arvand for a loan to help.  He hopes his plans come to fruition.

For the past 3 years, Eresi has been working hard to manage her retail shop, where she sells rice, sugar and busiquetes.\r\nTo help expand her business, Eresi has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more items such as rice to sell, and will help Eresi generate greater profits and provide her family with their basic needs. Eresi hopes that in the future she will be able to own a wholesale shop.\r\nEresi is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1317433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

En este cant\u00f3n se puede encontrar varios lugares para visitar como r\u00edos y bosques que son visitados por varios turistas, quienes al coincidir en las fiestas del cant\u00f3n pueden experimentar las exposiciones de artesan\u00edas y las ferias donde se exponen productos agr\u00edcolas y tambi\u00e9n ganado que son animales que conforman la riqueza de muchos habitantes. Estas actividades combinadas con el comercio han dado la oportunidad a la empresa privada para construir hoteles, hoster\u00edas y varias ofertas de servicios para turistas. Sin embargo la principal actividad de este pueblo es la agricultura y ganader\u00eda que cada a\u00f1o permiten que el \u00edndice de rendimiento econ\u00f3mico suba cada a\u00f1o a pesar de la poca transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda al lugar.

As\u00ed se describe a Alba y Florinda; quienes se dedican a la crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n y cada una espera incrementar sus ingresos comprando pollos, balanceado y mejorando los criaderos. Florinda tiene 2 hijos que estudian y es soltera, tiene 37 a\u00f1os.  Alba en cambio tiene ya 56 a\u00f1os y no tuvo oportunidad de estudiar y ha atravesado muchos obst\u00e1culos por su analfabetismo, tiene 2 hijos adolescentes que estudian.

","en":"Rebeca is 60 years old, is not married, and works hard every day to support her 16 year old child who is in high school. Rebeca was born to a poor family, and so she left education after primary school, for reasons beyond her control. She was born in Macar\u00e1, Ecuador, and now lives with her partner and son in Los Bancos Cant\u00f3n in a rural area of the Province of Pichincha. There are many places to visit in this Canton, such as rivers and forests, which attract many tourists. If these tourists visit during the regional festivals, they can see handicraft exhibitions and fairs with agricultural produce and livestock, which contribute to the livelihoods of many inhabitants. These activities, combined with trade, have provided private business opportunities in the form of hotels, hostels, and various tourism services.\r\n\r\nHowever, the principal activity of this area is agriculture and livestock, which allow the rate of economic performance to increase every year, despite the lack of technology in the region. In the midst of meadows, countryside and mountains, the inhabitants of this place make the most of every opportunity or the needs of visitors and neighbors to turn their continuous business ideas into reality, which contributes to the growth of the sector. \r\n\r\nRebeca has worked for several years in her grocery store. She learned this trade from her family and now wants to grow her business, buying new stock. She has a dream that, one day, she will be able to buy a plot of land to raise chickens. It is for this reason that she works in her store every for up to 14 hours at a time, from sunrise to night. Although there is a lot of competition, Rebeca hopes to increase her profits and improve her family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nFriends with the same enterprising spirit who want to succeed in their business activities have joined her. Their names are Alba and Florinda, and they work raising chickens to sell and hope to increase their earnings buying chickens and chicken feed, and making improvements to their cages. Florinda has two children who study, is single, and is 37 years old. Alba, meanwhile, is 56, never had the chance to study, and has overcome many hurdles due to her illiteracy. She has two teenage children who study. \r\n\r\nAnother member of this group is Laura, who is 31 years old and has two children aged 17 and six. She is single and makes a living selling bananas and corn on a stall in the street. The biggest challenge she faces every day is to transport her barbeque, table and containers from her stall to her home. She will use the loan to buy tools and supplies to improve her work. \r\n\r\nThese women have come together to request a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where, apart from trust and flexibility, they have received important tools to grow their businesses. They are grateful for Kiva's help enabling people around the world to make their dreams reality."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1317545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to increase the stock of products in their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T12:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeca Ufracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flerida Alba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1054.4,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":160.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":171.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":175.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":178.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":185.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.35},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":163.59,"local_amount":160.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":163.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524935,"comment":null},{"amount":175.04,"local_amount":171.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":175.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133239,"comment":null},{"amount":178.95,"local_amount":175.52,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":178.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313778,"comment":null},{"amount":182.35,"local_amount":178.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":182.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565383,"comment":null},{"amount":185.62,"local_amount":182.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":185.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814422,"comment":null},{"amount":189.45,"local_amount":185.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":189.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320595,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-26T03:32:32Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541125,"name":"Gil Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Gil vive en Playas, el tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad.

","en":"Qobiljon is a jack of all trades. He is as adept at dealing with people as he is with building materials. With the forest at his feet and a palette and paintbrush in his hands, he creates beauty. He is also very skilled in the field of animal husbandry, as he has 20 years of experience raising livestock. He is married and has 2 children. Because he himself was unable to get a good education when he was younger, he now wants his kids to grow up educated.  To achieve his goal, he works very hard, sparing no effort to earn a living and to save for a brighter future for his children and family. He has several head of sheep. Every time he sells an adult sheep, he buys a young one, and in this way, he earns an income. Currently at this point in the season, he does not want to sell his sheep since the prices for livestock have fallen slightly. In order to realise his plans, Qobiljon is seeking a loan to buy livestock and feed. He is really hoping for assistance from Kiva and is thankful in advance for the support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1312028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"for the purchase of livestock and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Qobiljon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2541.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":528.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":546.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":528.54,"local_amount":2458.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751975,"comment":null},{"amount":546.46,"local_amount":2541.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616052,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T19:18:47Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540391,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":390.08,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fresh fish to fry and sell.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2013-03-23T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-22T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":185.85,"local_amount":354,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":359.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364730709,"comment":null},{"amount":45.15,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372901763,"comment":null},{"amount":159.08,"local_amount":303,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":307.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381677754,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-23T15:37:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541161,"name":"Olivo Floresmilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olivo tiene 62 a\u00f1os de edad es casado tiene 8 hijos vive en el cant\u00f3n de Chillanes de la Provincia Bol\u00edvar. \n\nOlivo pertenecia a la ventanilla rural Progreso Comunitario pero por motivos de desintegraci\u00f3n del grupo realiza el cr\u00e9dito solo. \n\nOlivo se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz y cacao.

The combined incomes of Valijon and his wife are only sufficient to cover the family's expenses. The children are growing up, and there will be post-secondary education to be paid for and weddings to be hosted. Covering these costs will require a large outlay of money, and for this reason, Valijon has approached Arvand for a loan.

He says that he has worked with the group for around three and a half years, and that little by little, his business has improved. \r\n\r\nPreviously, he explains, he just bought and sold fruit and vegetables, which he purchased from his community and sold in the town of Tuxpan. Now, he grows his own fruit because his father gave him a large plot which has roughly 80 avocado trees, 20 peach trees and blackberries. He says that his fruit sells well, as he sells avocados by the tonne and people visit his orchard to buy them. He says, \u201cMy name is becoming known as I sell very high-quality fruit and this pleases my customers. I am very grateful to VisionFund for helping me with the loans, because it means I can buy what I need to improve my trees\u201d. \r\n\r\nToday, Iv\u00e1n is requesting a loan to buy supplies, as his trees have small fruit and May and June are harvest season. He recounts that during harvest time, he pays local people to help him gather the avocados and peaches. Iv\u00e1n's dream is to continue expanding his orchard because through large amounts of effort he has managed to make it succeed. He comments that he wants to build a home out of high-quality materials for his mother, because she lives in a small house at the moment. He also wants to continue studying since he left school after high school due to a lack of money. \r\n\r\nThe other group members are Imelda, Ausencio and Ma. Julia.

She says that she has already completed several loan cycles with VisionFund in the group called \"El Eucalipto\" (The Eucalyptus), and that she likes how the lending agency works. She says, \"The payments have not been hard to make, and apart from that, I have the opportunity to save and to stock my grocery store.\"\r\n\r\nShe says that she has had a small grocery store in her community for 20 years and that it was one of the first that existed in her town. She is asking for this loan to improve her shop. Although it is small, she keeps it very well stocked. It is in her home and her spouse built a little room out of wood so that she could put her business there. She wanted to start this type of business because she didn't have a stable job since she hadn't studied beyond primary school, and she couldn't find work elsewhere. Since she saw that there weren't any shops close to her home, she decided to start one. \r\n\r\nShe buys her products in different shops in the town of Zitacuaro, where they give her low prices. With the loan she is requesting, she wants to stock her shop with items like eggs, bleach, sugar, milk, beans, toilet paper, tissues, lightbulbs, napkins, soft drinks, snacks, bread, cookies, canned chiles, tuna, sardines, mayonnaise and cream. She also wants to get tomatoes, onions, serrano chiles and manzano chiles, which she says she will buy at the wholesale food market in Zitacuaro.\r\n\r\nSanta's goal is to be able to build her shop out of a material that won't get ruined by the weather. The other group members are named Mar\u00eda Margarita, Elvira, Lilia, Fausto, Ma. de los \u00c1ngeles, Cleotilde, Virginia, Camerina and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe. They will invest in their businesses and buy fruits and legumes from the region, items for grocery stores, and jewelry items to re-sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5850,"image":{"id":1317712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to invest in
