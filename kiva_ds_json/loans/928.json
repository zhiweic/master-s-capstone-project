Her growth plan starts with the purchase of supplies in larger amounts in order to qualify for volume purchase discounts which translate into higher profits and good customer service so that her business will function in a comfortable environment.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing she gets from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy supplies for her daily work.  \r\nShe will also invest in making improvements to her business with the purchase of work tools to improve the quality of her service; this is what her loan\u2019s success resides in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1167698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy manicure and pedicure supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-21T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-20T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Alba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":65395},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74699},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":76442},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78225},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80050},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81918},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83830},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85786},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87787},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89836},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91932},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":65395,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67307.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775419,"comment":null},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":67572,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:42Z","rounded_local_amount":69548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130590,"comment":null},{"amount":36.43,"local_amount":63348,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65200.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497511,"comment":null},{"amount":462.12,"local_amount":803685,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":827192.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928102,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T19:46:47Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":460803,"name":"Cleotilde","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cleotilde invirti\u00f3 su credikiva en dos partes, por un lado compr\u00f3 materias primas con los cuales fabric\u00f3 bolos y por otro lado invirti\u00f3 en el cultivo del campo; Su meta es continuar tecnificando su infraestructura y tener   maquinaria industrial y construir un deposito donde provisionarse de agua.

","en":"Minerva, 48, is the mother of three children whose ages range from 12 to 30.  She\u2019s owned a sewing business that operates at home for the last 18 years.  Her business was born when she used to work as a domestic employee and learned from her employer during two years.  When she got the opportunity, Minerva took courses at SENA [National Occupational Learning Center] and when she finished her course work decided to gradually set up a workshop that would allow her to work from home while caring for her children.\r\n\r\nShe currently sews for schools, students, independent workers and teachers; her focus is industrial clothing.  Minerva is currently manufacturing student outfits, sports uniforms and women\u2019s clothes primarily.  Her sales are primarily cash and her purchases in specialized sewing supply warehouses in the city of Cartagena are too.  Sometimes she travels to the city of Barranquilla to have more varied options in accessories.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy fabric and thread and will also do some physical upgrades to her shop because she wants to increase sales since she has growth potential in the marketplace that she\u2019s not yet explored which is precisely what will make the investment of her loan successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1167736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

For a number of reasons, she sadly separated from her partner, and now she is both mother and father to her child. Despite her youth, she is a very happy, hardworking, and enthusiastic person with a great desire to get ahead. She completed secondary school through her concerted efforts. Because she had to work and earn money to pay expenses, she could not pursue the business administration degree she so desired, though some day she would like to do so. In her free time, she likes to teach her daughter how to dance, and sometimes she prepares the delicious traditional pasta dish \"tallarines rojos\" to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith dedication and enthusiasm, Esthefany started her small business selling cosmetics and perfumes. She begins selling early each morning from a small case where she displays her products, and she also takes catalog orders. She works about 10 hours a day and believes her business succeeds because of her dedication and friendly customer service. \r\n\r\nEsthefany is very grateful to Kiva lenders for the support they provide that allows her to buy merchandise for her business: cosmetics, perfumes, and clothing such as polos, overalls, jackets, and other items. Esthefany will have a well-stocked business that she hopes will generate more sales and income. She will keep working and putting her efforts into getting ahead and achieving her dream of seeing her daughter become a professional, upstanding woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1167800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

The current business earns her about 22,000 KHR. For the four loan cycles that she has been with Kiva partner VisionFund, she has paid back all the loans with success, maintaining a better standard of living for her family. Now, she has formed a group of three female members to seek a new loan and she is the group leader. This is the fifth loan cycle for her and one of her fellow group members, while it is the first loan cycle for the remaining member. For her, the loan portion will be used to buy more pigs for raising.

Vanna has been engaged in this rice farming business for 26 years. For her, the main challenges are the declining price of the rice crop and the high cost of fertilizers, which affects her income. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these difficulties, she is applying for a new loan with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, as a first-time borrower. Vanna will use this loan to buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland.

The investment will allow her to fill orders that she has already received, orders for merchandise such as women's and children's shoes.  She asked us to pass along a message to Kiva lenders: \"I am grateful to have found an organiation that helps small businesses like mine get ahead, not only with financial help, but with training

Her business ideas have gradually been bearing fruit for every day she has more customers and more services that generate income.

","en":"Emilce, 41, is married and has two children who are 10 and 15 years old who she dreams becoming successful professionals; they are her greatest dream and for whom she works hard to provide with wellbeing.\r\n\r\nEmilce has a small sewing workshop where she manufactures women\u2019s clothes like skirts, dresses, blouses and pants.  She designs, cuts, prepares, assembles and finishes the pieces.  She started out 12 years ago working as an employee and then took three courses to perfect her dressmaking techniques and decided to start her own business.  She bought her first machine and worked to order gradually moving into working in the \u2018all included\u2019 modality.  Her goal for later on is to export her products to other countries in Latin America and to continue providing her children with professional studies.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is having cash flow that will allow her to make cash purchases thus obtaining special prices.  She sells in two ways: on credit when she provides the all-included and for cash when she does the sewing only.  This way of operating has allowed her to meet her customers\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy raw materials and supplies because she will make women\u2019s clothes ordered by her growing clientele that she wants to continue to retain.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1168528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":" to buy

Catalina will use the loan to buy an umbrella and more merchandise for her business and needs the loan because she lacks working capital to make these purchases.

","en":"Marisol, 52, lives in the southwest of the city with her four children whose ages range from 19 to 28 years.  She has a store there where she sells snacks, foodstuffs, soft-drinks, beverages and general staple items.  She started her business in 1998 initially selling from place to place and then when the opportunity arose to take over clientele from a neighbor\u2019s who was closing her store she started her own business venture buying basic staples like rice, oil, meat, tubers, vegetables, etc. at wholesale gradually adding other products.\n\nShe sells for cash Monday through Sunday from 6 in the morning until 9 at night.  Her main customers are housewives in the area and neighbors in general who find in her store what they need and are looking for to buy.\n\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the 11th loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She used previous loans to increase her profits and her dream is to prosper and expand the business into hardware; she\u2019s disciplined enough to accomplish this.\n\nShe will use her Kiva loan to buy beverages and foodstuffs which are the products that sell the most and she needs to have many of them in inventory so that her capital will turnover and her income will be greater which is what the Kiva loan will make possible for her to accomplish.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1168539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She owns a corner shop that she has operated from a space in her house for 20 years and a kiosk that she set up more recently at a local bus terminal.  She is a long-standing client of Fundacion and says that they have helped her grow her business.

Since they married, she has started a business buying and selling tires, because they noticed that in their area there are no stores that sell spare parts for cars. That's why she started the business two years ago. She now has regular customers who order a pair of tires from her every month. She says, \"The income is constant, because the roads are not asphalted. They are made of earth and rocks, which means that tires wear out constantly.\" For each tire sale, they earn an average of 50 soles, or 100 soles for a pair. Her customers are regular, so Betty wants to open her own store for wholesale tires. She is already gathering the necessary capital to achieve her goal.\r\n\r\nBetty belongs to the solidarity group Nuevo Amanecer and this is her third credit with MFP, so she promises to be on time with her payments.

This is her story:\r\n\r\nJacqueline owes her artistic inclinations to her mother, a fashion designer. \"I used to go to nearby markets for a necklace or a bracelet, but I was never satisfied with what I saw. So, I used to buy more than one, tear them apart, and make one piece according to my own design. Eventually I decided to learn about design and silversmith techniques, visiting several workshops and learning from those who would have me around. I haven't stopped ever since. My jewelry designs fill me with satisfaction. My motivation comes from knowing that someone might feel happy when they wear my designs. My inspiration comes from my children, a daughter and a son, who fill my house with happiness and give me strength to try new things every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to thank you in advance for the help you're giving me.

raised six children.  She works as a social worker at the village \"Dolono\" council and, to provide additional source of income for her family, has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for five years, having started this business with a group loan from Bai Tushum.  Thanks to Kunduz's hard work, today her business contains one dairy cow with offspring, fifteen small livestock and one horse, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 4,000 som (KGS).

This motivates me to wake up each day to carve! I have trained about 30 people to carve and some of them have now set up their own workshops. I currently have five people working with me. My dream is to one day have a big workshop to train a lot of people \u2013 especially school dropouts who think life has ended because their parents couldn't further their education. Their success in the art of carving would be my legacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for your support through this microcredit; it will help me so much!

She sells a variety of items for women such as cosmetics, cloth, small home appliances, and women's outfits.\r\nHer business was born when her husband went to Panama in search of better opportunities for making an income for his family; she was required to assume all of the costs while he got settled and his income stabilized.

For now, she works exclusively on order, so as not to have any unsold products on her hands. She works three days a week, since she only visits her customers when she has the order. What she sells the most are products such as perfumes, deodorants, make-up products, creams, and lipsticks. Since she has been doing this for quite some time, she would like to be able to offer more variety, which is why she will use the loan to buy more types of cosmetics as well as clothes to sell.

adquiri\u00f3 su experiencia de 5 a\u00f1os; En el a\u00f1o  2009 inici\u00f3 su propio negocio, con $300.000 Cop, enseres prestados 10 platos y unas cuantas sillas; El primer d\u00eda llegaron 15

Sus ventas las realizan directamente al consumidor final y vende el 34% de ellas a cr\u00e9dito y el 66% de contado. Sus principales clientes son empleados de empresas ubicadas en el sector, donde esta su restaurante y algunos visitantes del barrio. Su meta mas adelante es tener un local de su propiedad donde ubicarse m\u00e1s c\u00f3modamente y apoyar las carreras universitarias de sus hijos para que en un futuro tengan un mayor potencial de \u00e9xito. Actualmente su necesidad de crecimiento no se detiene pero su mayor desaf\u00edo es que su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente ante el logro de sus metas empresariales. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas e insumos, pues responder\u00e1 a la demanda de tres empresas mas y necesita tener suficientes inventarios para lograr descuentos e insumos para responder a ellas. La mayor ventaja competitiva de Martha es su experiencia y capacidad de trabajo y disciplina para afrontar sus propios retos.   ","en":"Martha is 35 years old and she works making and selling lunches, an idea that was born after she worked in different places like stores, bakeries and restaurants where she acquired her 5 years of experience. In 2009, she began her own business, with a loan of 300 Colombian Pesos, loaned fixtures, 10 plates and a few chairs. The first day 15 customers arrived and today she can count on 50 customers each day. She provides lunches to 4 businesses and she offers 5 menus simultaneously. The sales are made directly to her customers and she sells 34% by credit and 66% by cash. Her main clients are employees of the businesses located in this area, where her restaurant is, and a few visitors from the neighborhood. Her highest goal is to acquire her own place where she can locate herself more comfortably and support the university education of her children so that in the future they will have a greater chance of success. Right now, her need to grow has not stopped, but her biggest challenge is that her working capital is insufficient to meet her business goals. This is the reason why she seeks a loan, the first financing that comes from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. Through the loan she will buy more source materials and supplies because she will respond to the demand of three more businesses and she needs to have sufficient inventory to be able to obtain discounts and the supplies necessary to respond to them. The greatest competitive advantage that Martha has is her experience, her capacity to work and her ability to confront her own challenges. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1168770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy source materials and supplies\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-08-22T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-21T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":153765},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":186520},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":190872},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":195325},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":199883},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":204547},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":209320},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":214204},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":219202},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":224317},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":229551},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272494}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.11,"local_amount":153765,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":154134.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775446,"comment":null},{"amount":104.45,"local_amount":186520,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":186967.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387433,"comment":null},{"amount":106.89,"local_amount":190872,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":191330.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994260,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":195325,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":195793.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130614,"comment":null},{"amount":111.93,"local_amount":199883,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200362.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519477,"comment":null},{"amount":114.55,"local_amount":204547,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":205037.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071319,"comment":null},{"amount":117.22,"local_amount":209320,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":209822.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497537,"comment":null},{"amount":119.95,"local_amount":214204,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":214718.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527351,"comment":null},{"amount":529.52,"local_amount":945564,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":947833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928125,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-12T14:08:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":461176,"name":"22-Virgen De Urkupina Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento 22-VIRGEN DE URKUPINA,  Est\u00e1  compuesto por nueve integrantes siete mujeres y dos varones,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

She forms a beautiful family with him and their three sons, a nine-year-old and two seven-year-olds.  She sells artisanal bread and chocolate in tablets and her husband grows tomatoes and green chilies.\r\n\r\nThis family works baking and selling artisanal bread especially tustacas [sweet cookies with raw sugar topping] and totopostes [cheese and corn cookies], among others.  She also processes cocoa beans to sell chocolate in tablet form.  She sells the bread twice a week and the chocolate tablets twice a week.  She\u2019s been doing this since she was ten-years-old.  She says that her grandmother and her mother do the same thing and this activity gives them status and recognition in their community because of the quality of their products.  At the same time it makes it possible for her to generate and retain customers.  Amanda states proudly that her products are well-liked and sold in the United States by means of people who take them there and by family and friends who return to the community to visit their families and then return [to the USA] to work.  She currently employs two women she pays 20% of sales.\r\n\r\nShe pays cash in the municipal market for all of the raw materials she uses and she also sells her products there once a week; it\u2019s located six kilometers from her house.  From her house to the bus stop she must walk for about one and a half kilometers along gravel roads with the loaded crates balanced on her head.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy raw materials to make bread and building materials to roof the galley protecting the oven from the rain and the sun.   In addition, she will also buy fertilizer for the tomato crops.  She has 2500 plants in seed boxes that will be transplanted in about a week.\r\n\r\nThe investment will serve for maintenance and protection of the production infrastructure (artisanal oven), for working capital for making bread and chocolate tablets.  With respect to this latter activity in particular, she is planning on hiring two more women to sell it.  Finally, it will help to buy farm supplies especially fertilizer and insecticide for the 2500 tomato plants.\r\n\r\nShe believes that her products are well-received by her customers and they refer her to others which is why she wants to process more to employ more women from the community especially to sell thus improving their living conditions.  She hopes that the tomato harvest will be good.  She believes that producing isn\u2019t difficult but the selling is and she gets directly involved in it because she believes she\u2019s better at it than her life companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1168800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to

This is their only income. She has 15 main pigs whom she fattens and takes care of with a great deal of dedication.  She sells their meat to order and sometimes sells the pigs live. \"Everything depends on the client\", she says. She is doing very well in this business.  She has a good income which allows her to raise her children, but to bring home extra income she also works as a laborer in various fields during the harvest, and as a brick layer in the nearby area. Her wish for the future is to open a restaurant in her home, as there are none in her area.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the solidarity group \"The Entrepreneurs\" and this is her second loan with MFP.  She is very grateful for the support they give her to meet her goals. She promises to comply with the payments of her loan and also enjoys being associated with them since they have known each other for many years.
