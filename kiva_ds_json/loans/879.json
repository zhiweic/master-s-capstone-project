However, just a month back, he had to pay tuition fees and living arrangements for his children, and that made him lack the money at the moment to buy some spare parts for his bus. This is why Uran is requesting a KIVA loan via VisionFund Albania for the first time.  He is grateful to KIVA for the opportunity he has been granted, because this loan will be a great help to him.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1116957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"buy

single 35-year-old woman. She lives in the city of Ica, which is characterized by its hot climate and welcoming people. She has always been a very hardworking and enthusiastic woman who dedicates all her efforts to bettering herself and coming out ahead. Unfortunately, owing to a lack of financial resources she was not able to study to be a nurse, as she wanted so much. But she wants to do it one day. Ana is very religious, and in her free moments she likes to dedicate a little time to reading, especially reading the Bible. Sometimes when she visits her parents she cooks some very delicious \"Tallarines Rojos,\" (homestyle Peruvian spaghetti in red sauce) to pamper them. \r\n\r\nThanks to her great desire to overcome, and thanks to the support of her mother, Ana began her small business selling hardware items. She works at her business approximately ten hours each day, and can wait on an average of 45 customers each day. Ana believes that her business is going well owing to the good prices and the friendly, respectful treatment she offers her customers.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful to the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the offered help she'll be able to buy merchandise such as knives, nails, bolts, brackets, sealant, pipes, wire, and other general hardware items. In this way Ana will have her business better supplied, and she'll be able to increase her sales and financial income. With this increase, little by little, she wants to be able to accomplish her great dream of being able to study nursing and having a bigger hardware store; and in a not-too-distant future being able to have branches of her store in different parts of the

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercedes operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

Fue as\u00ed como emprendi\u00f3 su camino como comerciante, distribu\u00eda la mercanc\u00eda entre sus conocidos, amigos y vecinos del barrio Terranova del municipio de Soledad que le cancelaban a cr\u00e9dito con plazos quincenales y mensuales.  En el mes de mayo del a\u00f1o 2011, se vincul\u00f3 a dos empresas muy reconocidas de venta por cat\u00e1logo ya que deseaba ofrecer no solo ropa sino productos de tocador como cosm\u00e9ticos, perfumes, bisuter\u00eda y otros para el cuidado personal.  Con su credikiva quiere tener capital disponible para seguir comprando los productos, trabajando tranquilamente sin importar los plazos otorgados a sus clientes; algunas veces en estos cat\u00e1logos se presentan productos con muy buenos precios ofertados que desea adquirir para vender y ganar un buen margen de rentabilidad. Actualmente cuenta con 20 clientes fijos y algunos ocasionales a quienes tambi\u00e9n les ofrece mercanc\u00eda. Karina tiene 19 a\u00f1os, vive en uni\u00f3n libre y tiene un hijo de 3 a\u00f1os pero aunque su vida gira r\u00e1pidamente alrededor de su familia y su negocio, no le falta tiempo para so\u00f1ar.

This was how she set out on the road as a merchant.  She distributed the merchandise to her acquaintances, friends, and neighbors in the Terranova neighborhood in the town of Soledad, and they paid them off on credit with bimonthly and monthly deadlines.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011 she connected with two very well-recognized catalogue-sales businesses because she wanted to sell not only clothing but also beauty products such as cosmetics, perfume, costume jewelry, and other personal-care products.  Sometimes in these catalogues there are products on special offer with very good prices that she wants to get, to sell and earn a good profit margin.  Currently she has 20 steady customers and some occasional ones whom she also want to offer merchandise.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan she wants to have disposable capital to continue buying products, working peacefully without worrying about the deadlines given to her customers.\r\n\r\nKarina, 19, lives in a common-law relationship and has a three-year-old child.  Although her life revolves quickly around her family and her business, she doesn't lack time for dreaming.  In the not-too-distant future she wants to be introducing new lines of products, to sell a little bit of everything, and buy a display case in which to show them--in all of this, always thinking about the economic growth of her family and her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1116844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy products from catalogues and clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-15T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-15T05:20:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":69087},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":70699},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72349},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74037},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75764},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":77532},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":79341},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":81191}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.3,"local_amount":69087,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":71453.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338905,"comment":null},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":70699,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":73120.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395456,"comment":null},{"amount":85.39,"local_amount":146386,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151399.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387240,"comment":null},{"amount":102.16,"local_amount":175132,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":181130.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071150,"comment":null},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":138696,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":143446.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356498091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T11:17:38Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T10:44:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":437489,"name":"Kerin Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kerin, est\u00e1 solicitando un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para poder iniciar una nueva inversi\u00f3n en el negocio de helados, compr\u00e1ndose una variedad de sabores en sorbetes, conos, paletas, y otros productos que son necesarios en variedad para poder ofrecer a sus clientes.\nEl manifiesta que con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior pudo realizar una buena inversi\u00f3n de la cual agreg\u00f3 un vendedor m\u00e1s que le ayuda a distribuir en otras zonas de la ciudad, considera que su negocio hoy en d\u00eda es m\u00e1s rentable y por lo mismo ha mejorado su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y ha podido contribuir a las necesidades del hogar.\n","en":"Kerin is requesting a new loan so that he can start another investment in his ice cream business.

is Lewelyn, 39, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Cesar, and a mother to a three children; two of whom are in high school, while the youngest is still in elementary grade. By the grace of God, she has managed to support their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nLewelyn has operated a farm for almost 7 years now. She plants seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines like pineapples, peanuts, bananas and other Filipino fruit staples which are grown mostly in the south region of Luzon. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seeds and other tools for maintenance of the farm. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLewelyn dreams to be able to send all her children to college.

","en":"Gulnora is one of the most active, punctual, and honest customers of MDO Arvand, LLC with a long history of taking loans. She took her first loan of 500 somoni when her business was still very small. She found Arvand through word of mouth, requested financial support, and then took a chance. Using her loan, Gulnora purchased a new lot of merchandise and began traveling outside the city to sell it. There are no large shopping centres in the countryside, and so Gulnora's business rapidly flourished. In a very short time, she greatly increased her financial resources, all the while working with Arvand. Gulnora believes that MDO Arvand, LLC was the reason for the success of her business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gulnora sells men's clothing in the countryside, where she travels four times per month.

He is married to Lolita, a housewife and mother to their three children. By the grace of God, Roberto has managed to support his family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nRoberto operates a farm. He plants seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines, like pineapples, bananas, and other Filipino fruit staples which are grown mostly in the southern region of Luzon. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 500 from sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a loan of PHP 11,000. He will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seeds, and other tools for the maintenance of the farm. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Roberto faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Con el producto de lo ahorrado en sus empleos, hace 10 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 invertir en la venta a cr\u00e9dito de ropa por encargos entre sus vecinos y amigos, sin embargo, ella segu\u00eda trabajando y fortaleciendo su capital.  Hoy en d\u00eda ofrece mayor variedad de productos como lencer\u00eda, electrodom\u00e9sticos menores, ropa interior y queso que le traen cada 2 d\u00edas de su pueblo natal.  Solicita su primer cr\u00e9dito Kiva ya que pretende invertir en la compra de abanicos, ropa en general, paraguas, leche en polvo, arroz, entre otros art\u00edculos para satisfacer la demanda actual.

They came from the municipality of San Juan Nepomuceno, part of the county of Bolivar. \r\n\r\nWith the money she saved from her jobs, 10 years ago she decided to invest in the sale of clothes through a catalog, to sell to her neighbours and friends, however she kept working and strengthening her capital. Today she offers better variety of products, like lingerie, small household appliances, underwear and cheese that she gets every 2 days from her native town.\r\n\r\nShe requests her first loan with Kiva that she wants to use to buy fans, clothes in general, umbrellas, dried milk, rice and other products to satisfy the present day demands.\r\n\r\nDulcina broke up her relationship with her partner 2 years ago, however this situation filled her with courage and strength, she decided not to let herself be scared by the adversity and to stop working as a maid to have more time available to be able to focus all her attention to her family and business. \r\n\r\nSince then she travels periodically to Maicao, a city from the county of Guajira where she buys some of the items she sells. \r\n\r\nShe has gained many new customers because she's made herself known in her neighbourhood. Her sales are mostly on credit, charging customers every 13 to 15 days. She also buys new products weekly in various stores from her city.\r\n\r\nBeing 61 years old she is a very dynamic and active person, Her business is very well organised and she dreams with making it grow more so she can have a bigger profit margin than the one she has today of 40%.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own house in the neighbourhood of Santa Maria with one of her seven children, all of them adults.

This kind of transportation is very important in his region, since most of Baalback's citizens work in Beirut or attend a university in Beirut, and transportation to Beirut is very hard to find since the government didn't do anything new to ease this process on the villagers.\r\n\r\nZouheir plans his time upon his customers' schedules so that no one will be late in the morning and none will be left in the afternoon. He manages his time, and that's what attracted most of his customers.\r\n\r\nZouheir is applying for a YOUTH LOAN from Kiva partner Al Majmoua for the first time in order to make necessary maintenance to his van's body and mechanical situation.\r\n\r\nZouheir hopes to invest future loans in starting new businesses.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLilita makes a living operating a private pool resort. She owns a private pool that she offers to be rented on a daily basis. Usually a private pool resort has a single swimming pool with one to two rooms to accommodate five to ten people inside a private property. It is where family gets together to unwind and sometimes to hold special events like birthdays. She has been in this business for almost three years. Her customers are people in the community and local tourists. She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from rentals every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a loan of 50,000 PHP. She will be using the money to buy supplies like tiles, chlorine and for the maintenance of the private pool resort as well.

She lives with her husband, Luis, and their daughter in the barrio of Chillogallo. Quito is the capital of Ecuador and also the second largest city. It is located on the slopes of the Andes mountain range and is 2,800 meters (9,180 feet) above sea level. Along with being the political capital, Quito is the country's cultural and financial center. The city is divided into three main sections: the historic center, where one can easily see how it was like during the colonial period; the north, traditionally home to the upper class; and the south, known as \"the poor side\" of the city. Elizabeth established her business five years ago in one of the city's wholesale markets, where she dedicates four hours every day to selling different fruits from Quito and the surrounding areas. After her work day ends, Elizabeth cares for her daughter. Of course, her daughter has grown up and doesn't need as much care as before, which is why Elizabeth wants to start working more every day. She is requesting the loan from Kiva to be able to purchase larger quantities of fruit and thus reduce the unit price. Furthermore, Elizabeth believes that working more hours and selling larger quantities is going to help her increase income, which would allow her to fulfill her dream of buying her own home for herself and her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1117060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Ellas son amigas y conocidas de hace mucho tiempo, y hoy solicitan un cr\u00e9dito grupal de Kiva para cada una poder mejorar diferentes a\u00e9reas de sus negocios. Santo Domingo es una ciudad bastante grande, que se ubica pr\u00e1cticamente en el centro de Ecuador uniendo la Costa y la Sierra por una carretera que va desde el nivel del mar hasta los 2800 metros de altura. Debido a esto Santo Domingo se caracteriza por ser una ciudad de bastante comercio y trafico tur\u00edstico. Otro factor muy interesante es que por su ubicaci\u00f3n e importancia Santo Domingo se ha convertido en una de las ciudades m\u00e1s multiculturales del Ecuador. Todo esto convive bajo un clima h\u00famedo tropical a una altura de 200 metros.\nGladys tiene un peque\u00f1o puesto donde vende colas y aguas, este negocio es muy peque\u00f1o y no alcanza a cubrir las necesidades de Gladys y sus 4 hijos, por lo que el pr\u00e9stamo solicitado a trav\u00e9s de KIVA es muy importante para ella, le permitir\u00eda comprarse un congelador y adem\u00e1s comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda, si todo sale bien con esto Gladys podr\u00eda alg\u00fan d\u00eda cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser due\u00f1a de su propia tienda.\nKetty por otro lado, tiene un peque\u00f1o bazar y perfumer\u00eda. Ella necesita su pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertir en materiales para la venta como l\u00e1pices, libros, cuadernos etc. El sue\u00f1o de Ketty es ver a su hijo convertirse en un profesional, por lo que necesita producir m\u00e1s plata para poder pagar sus estudios de colegio y universidad eventualmente. Ketty trabaja alrededor de 6 horas diarias y su esposo tambi\u00e9n ayuda en la casa con su trabajo de mec\u00e1nico, pero Ketty necesita vender m\u00e1s para poder cubrir todos sus gastos.\nFinalmente tenemos a Bertha, ella es due\u00f1a de un puesto de venta de carnes asadas, Bertha tiene dos hijos en edad de escuela y tiene muchos sue\u00f1os, principalmente comprar su propia casa, ver a sus hijos convertirse en profesionales y ser due\u00f1a de su propio restaurante. Sin embargo el primer paso para ella es acceder a este pr\u00e9stamo para poder invertir en materia prima y mejorar sus ventas. \nTodas estas mujeres son ejemplos de madres. Para las tres ha resultado muy  dif\u00edcil acceder a cr\u00e9ditos ya que dos de ellas solo cuentan con estudios primarios y una con secundaria, ninguna asisti\u00f3 a la universidad y han tenido que ingeni\u00e1rselas y aprender en el acto para poder sobrevivir. Todas tienen ya por lo menos algunos a\u00f1os de experiencia con sus negocios y resulta fundamental poder adquirir sus pr\u00e9stamos para poder dar el siguiente paso y seguir creciendo, por su bien y el de su familia.\n","en":"Gladys, Ketty and Bertha are three women who live in the parish of Rio Verde in the city of Santo Domingo, Ecuador. They are friends and have known each other a long time, and they are requesting this group loan from Kiva so each can improve different areas of their businesses. Santo Domingo is a rather large city located in practically the center of Ecuador, with a highway running through it linking the coast with the mountains going from sea level to 2,800 meters (9,180 feet) above it. Because of this, Santo Domingo is known for being a rather commercial city with a lot of tourist traffic. Another very interesting item of note is that thanks to its location and importance the city has become one of the most multicultural in Ecuador. All of this coexists under a humid tropical climate 200 meters (650 feet) above sea level. Gladys has a small drink stand where she sells colas and water. This business is very small and it doesn't meet the needs of Gladys and her four children. Requesting this loan through Kiva is very important to her because it will allow her to purchase a freezer as well as more merchandise. If everything goes well, Gladys will be able to one day fulfill her dream of being owner of her own store. Ketty, on the other hand, has a small store and perfume shop. She is requesting the loan to invest in items to sell like pencils, books, notepads and other items. Her dream is to see her son become a professional, so she needs to earn more money to be able to eventually pay for his college education. Ketty works about six hours every day, and her husband, who is a mechanic, also helps out, but she needs to increase her sales in order to cover all of their expenses. Finally there is Bertha, who owns a stand selling grilled meats. She has two school-age children and has a lot of dreams, chiefly to buy her own home, see her children become professionals and to own a restaurant. Of course, the first step is to get this loan so she can be able to purchase supplies and increase her sales. All of these women are model mothers, but it has been difficult to receive a loan since two of them only have elementary-school educations, and the other a high-school education. None of them attended a university, and they all have had to make do and learn on the fly to get by. All of them now have at least a few years of experience with their businesses, and acquiring loans is essential to be able to take the next step and keep growing, for their own good as well as that of their families."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1117064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a freezer and buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-06-16T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-16T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1229.36,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":135.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":145.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":153.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":159.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":162.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.59,"local_amount":135.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":137.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334559,"comment":null},{"amount":147.49,"local_amount":145.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":147.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390483,"comment":null},{"amount":153.42,"local_amount":150.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149473,"comment":null},{"amount":155.89,"local_amount":153.32,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":155.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382597,"comment":null},{"amount":158.2,"local_amount":155.58,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":158.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989685,"comment":null},{"amount":162.64,"local_amount":159.96,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:09Z","rounded_local_amount":162.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126095,"comment":null},{"amount":165.4,"local_amount":162.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":165.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516697,"comment":null},{"amount":169.37,"local_amount":166.57,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":169.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068561,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-15T13:39:00Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:55:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":437851,"name":"Perveen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perveen is married and the mother of two daughters and two sons.

In her free time, Ofiyat likes to work with her hands - she sews traditional items and decorates them with gold thread embroidery. Her products are popular with brides and grooms and are also used as gifts at other festivities. Ofiyat's husband and son are also employed - they work at a factory that manufactures plastic frames for doors and windows. Everyone in the family works and shares in all expenses.\r\n\r\nOn advice of her friend who is also a client of MDO Arvand, LLC, Ofiyat turned to this organization for a loan to purchase livestock. Using that loan, she bought two sheep and fattened them over the course of several months. Having sold the sheep, Ofiyat spent her profits on an event for her son. Using the current loan, she would like to buy some jewelry for herself, as this has been a longtime dream of hers.

Nevertheless, he has been working for possibly 10 years as a motorcycle taxi driver, and he devotes four to six hours a day to it.  While he does this, his partner helps him take care of the store.

She has been married to Eduardo, age 67, for 40 years.  They have five children, who are now adults.  Her house is her own, and she got it as a wedding present.  She lives there with two minor grandchildren, whom she has been raising for some time.\r\n\r\nHer primary business activity consists of preparing various foods.  She has a gift for cooking, and she is well-known as one of the women who have the most exquisite tasting food in the city.  This is why her restaurant is one of the busiest in the area.  Her customers come daily to enjoy the delicious meals that she prepares with such care and affection.\r\n\r\nEver since she was very young she has had a passion for the culinary arts.  In time, she has been developing her capabilities and her senses in order to improve her seasoning.  She now knows how to do that, and she rapidly knows the best flavor for her customers\u2019 preferences.\r\n\r\nShe still remembers nostalgically, but with great pride, how she started in this work 20 years ago.  She dreamed of having her own restaurant.  With the passage of time, she has seen how her effort and constancy have produced the fruits of her labor and accomplishments that she is now able to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is preparing the food.  She enjoys the aromas, the flavors, and knowing that her loyal diners enjoy each dish.  That is why she does her work with a lot of love and dedication.  She does this, even though, at time she feels that she cannot please everyone as quickly as she would like to do.  This is because she sometimes works alone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, with a little patience, a lot of respect, and a big smile she succeeds in making her customers happy and very satisfied with her restaurant.  She wants to continue with the improvement of the infrastructure of her restaurant.  She also wants to set the business up with some specific dishes.\r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She is grateful to the people who make this loan possible so that she can continue with her objectives.

She offers potential clients items such as colognes, cosmetics, underwear, and jewelry in an effort to make a contribution to the family income.

She has already collected the orders from clients in her community. All she requires now is the working capital with which to purchase the items she intends to sell. In order to make these purchases, Mar\u00eda must travel by boat to Puntarenas, across the Nicoya Gulf, which takes about two hours each way. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a hard-working, ambitious entrepreneur. She organizes her day in order to optimize her productivity. In the mornings, she carries out the domestic tasks at home and sends her daughter to school. When Mar\u00eda travels to Puntarenas, she wakes up at 4 a.m. because the boat leaves at 6 a.m. and the walk from her home to where the boat leaves is long. In the afternoons, she visits her clients and collects orders. At night, Mar\u00eda attends night school, where she is in the process of completing her high school certificate.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's goals are to increase her client base and to gain clients in all parts of the Isla de Chira, the island where she lives. She hopes to be able to finance the studies of her daughter in the future. Mar\u00eda says her main obstacle is the competition she faces from other vendors.

","en":"Carmen is 28 years old.  She is a modest, optimistic and very hard-working woman.  She has a 6-year-old daughter called Milena and she works hard every day in order to provide her with a better quality of life.  The family currently live in their own home which they acquired through a lot of hard work and commitment.  There they share their happy days and sad days, as a united family.\r\n\r\nCarmen's business is selling spare parts and accessories for all kinds of vehicles but mainly motorcycle taxis.  She also services and repairs these vehicles.  Thanks to the excellent quality of her work, she is considered one of the best in her field and has become one of the best-known mechanics in the city, an honor she shares with her husband who has been working alongside her since she opened the business 18 months ago.  The couple have a lot of customers which provides them with security and financial stability.  They carry out their work in premises that they rent.  At first things were a little difficult owing to the fear and doubts that they had but they remained undaunted and now they continue wanting to grow their business.  What Carmen most enjoys about her work is seeing that her customers are happy when they find their cars in good condition and working well.  She is familiar with this feeling of satisfaction because she has two motorcycle taxis of her own which she hires out for transporting passengers.  Her goal is to acquire larger premises so that she can provide her customers with a better service and to have a larger quantity of different brands of spare parts both to sell and to use in her repair work.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's fifth loan from MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that is being placed in her with this loan.
