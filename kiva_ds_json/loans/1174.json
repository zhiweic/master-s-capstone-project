Her objective is to educate her children by means of her effort, to give them the conditions she was unable to have personally and above all to be successful in this new activity she intends to execute.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":289.83,"image":{"id":1393859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a corn mill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-24T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-23T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":66.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2015-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.16},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.8,"local_amount":44.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":44.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814982,"comment":null},{"amount":52.23,"local_amount":52.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090814,"comment":null},{"amount":70.3,"local_amount":70.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":70.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856811,"comment":null},{"amount":59.77,"local_amount":59.77,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":59.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505086,"comment":null},{"amount":62.73,"local_amount":62.73,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":62.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716164,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-09T22:13:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":585139,"name":"Anne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anne is 37 years old.

Ashley understands the importance of one-on-one support with her clients, and this mindset has garnered their appreciation.\r\n\r\nPreviously a personal trainer, as well as the operator of a fine art gallery, Ashley says that her last seven years as a pilates instructor are a stark contrast from her previous endeavors. \u201cI knew I could run an art gallery, but my heart wasn't in it \u2026 now it\u2019s about my clients, not myself,\u201d she shares. Ashley believes that her studio is not just a place for her customers to work out, but a place to explore the body, both mentally as well as physically.\r\n\r\nAlthough she has only moved into her studio recently, she is excited by the demand she has seen for her instruction thus far. Mind Body Pilates and Wellness caters primarily to senior citizens, and until recently, her business has relied solely on word of mouth. She hopes that the use of social media marketing, as well as numerous positive reviews online, will continue to fuel her growth.\r\n\r\nBeing the sole proprietor of a pilates studio open seven days a week is challenging, but Ashley feels that it is the least she can do. \u201cI am open in the future to hiring employees as my client base increases, but for now, I prefer to be the face of the business.\u201d \r\n\r\nAshley plans to use her $7,800 Kiva loan to purchase additional pilates equipment to increase her client capacity and grow her business. If growth continues to increase, she dreams of someday increasing the size of her studio and sharing the health benefits of this high-intensity workout with even more people.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":864.82,"image":{"id":1393212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to

He lives with his wife and their two children, who are 1- and 7-years old respectively.  Gustavo started doing agricultural work 25 years ago, which he learned thanks to his father.  Today, the work provides his family's income.  Currently, Gustavo has bean, pea and tree tomato plants on the farm where he lives.  To earn an income, he sells his harvest in the town center.  Gustavo is a hard-working, active and dedicated man.  He is constantly looking for opportunities that will allow him to get ahead.  That is why he is requesting a loan- to invest in the purchase of agricultural supplies (compost, fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides).  With these supplies, he will be able to continue caring for his crop and harvest excellent quality produce, which will increase his sales and his income.  All of this will help Gustavo to meet one of his main goals, which is to expand his crop in order to generate more income.  This would give him more stable finances and provide his family with greater well-being and a better quality of life.  It would also provide an excellent education for his young children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJelyn operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nJelyn hopes that her business will flourish and dreams to have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She is 37 years old and she is happily married to Jon Ruel who works as a driver. God has blessed them with love. Life indeed is hard, but by the grace of God they were able to raise their children well and they are helping each other in working for their family.\r\n\r\nMarilyn owns a variety store. This is a small store that can be owned by anyone in the community, and the store is just connected to or just inside their houses. This is where you can buy a sachet of shampoo or conditioner, a bar of soap, a Php5-worth of cooking oil or a single egg. She gets her products from a wholesaler at a lower price, and then she will sell them per piece for a higher price to make a profit. Her regular customers are her neighbors, passersby and the people in the community. She earns about Php300 a day.\r\n\r\nTo be able to expand her inventory, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She started this business many years ago by selling snacks. After a while, she got the idea to open a grocery store, taking advantage of the fact that there was not a business by her home that sold basic goods and general merchandise.\n\nShe makes her purchases in wholesale markets, stores, and from suppliers who come to her store to sell their products. Her sales are in cash and credit to regular and occasional customers.\n\nThe payment of her family's expenses, which include food and maintenance, depend on the business that she runs.\n\nMar\u00eda requests this loan for working capital, to invest in more products for the store, and for general merchandise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":304.25,"image":{"id":1395756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy food products, household goods, and general merchandise to sell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1227.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.12,"local_amount":2506.54,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2558.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399855554,"comment":null},{"amount":51.88,"local_amount":1273.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:51:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1299.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410130859,"comment":null},{"amount":52.4,"local_amount":1286.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1312.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419896513,"comment":null},{"amount":51.69,"local_amount":1268.81,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545816,"comment":null},{"amount":46.16,"local_amount":1133.03,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199570,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T13:46:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586126,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a single lady of forty-seven years, and she has two school-going children.

Unfortunately, a teacher\u2019s salary is not enough to make ends meet for a family. In the region, there is a high unemployment rate, but self-employment helps inhabitants to make living.  So, she decided to start her own business with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Ekaterine\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. She received the credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo in a start-up program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan of $5000, she will purchase stock of groceries and open a grocery shop. This will increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

","en":"Zuhriddin is 25 years old, he is married. His wife is a hardworking woman and helps him in running of the business. Zuhriddin and his wife do not have children. He has been in the land cultivation for over six years. He mainly grows vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, onions and other vegetables. Zuhriddin has an additional income from animal husbandry buying and selling pedigree horses. He steadily grows his business and becomes competitive on the local market. Zuhriddin plans to grow his business further and increase the headcount of horses. However he does not have a stable and a good shed to keep the vegetables. In the winter time he does not have proper conditions for keeping the horses and that's why he needs to build a stable and a shed very soon before the winter arrives. He is asking for a loan in the amount of $3,000 USD to buy building materials such as cement, wood, sand and brick. He waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16.73,"image":{"id":1392642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Nusratby is an honest and decent woman. She has already been given four cycles of credit by IMON. She is 52 years old. She is a widow and had 4 children. Her children are 20, 23, 25, and 28 years old. After the death of her husband, she provided for and raised her children alone. It was very hard for Nusratby to manage her families expenses, as she worked in a school for 25 years. Now her children are all grown up and have begun to help her. Nusratby really loves her job and is one of the best teachers in her school. Her pupils work in different spheres of society and Nusratby takes pride in them. Nusratby has dreamed of buying a Tico brand car for some time now, but as her salary is small and she is unable to have any savings, she has requested a loan. She is asking for a loan in the amount of 1700 USD to buy a car. She awaits your kindness and relies upon your charity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":399.02,"image":{"id":1392670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To buy a TICO brand car.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T12:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nusratby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":74.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":77.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":92.8},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":101.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":108.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":117.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.2,"local_amount":74.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":74.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550446,"comment":null},{"amount":74.79,"local_amount":74.79,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":74.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410959406,"comment":null},{"amount":173.07,"local_amount":173.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":173.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075558,"comment":null},{"amount":76.96,"local_amount":76.96,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989181,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T00:37:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586165,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is a 62-year-old farmer from the town of Bien Unido, Bohol.

is 27 years old from the small town of Sagarejo in the Kakheti Region. She is a mother of two children (7 and 4 years old). Natia's husband works for Georgian Special Forces and gets a monthly salary. Besides that, the family owns a small vineyard and sells the grapes seasonally. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the existing income is not enough to make ends meet for the four-member family. So Natia decided to start a clothing trading business with a loan. But the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. Natia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShe received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Startup Program gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of 2,200 GEL, she will purchase second-hand clothing at wholesale prices and sell it in her community.

In particular, they have a milk cow, whose milk is used in cheese products. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides this, they have a plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRaul requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Raul has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Raul will renovate a flat to rent out.

She is married and has 4 children (2 sons and 2 daughters). Since 1992, she has practiced farming - animal husbandry and crop farming, starting this business with 2000 som (KGS). Her monthly revenue from this business is 7000 som (KGS). Thanks to her hard work and determination, Yrsalatkan currently has an excellent farm: 4 dairy cows and 15 sheep. Her husband and daughter help her with the farm. The earnings have allowed Yrsalatkan to multiply the cattle in her household and thereby improve her family's well-being.  In order to further develop her agricultural business, Yrsalatkan requested a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cattle. Yrsalatkan plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the future expansion of the number of cattle on her farm.

She has been working at preparing and selling Mouneh (special way of food conserving and production) for ten years. In 2010, she started her own business from home to help her husband with covering their family's expenses, especially because she has a child enrolled in a private school and the other is on the way. So they have to stay prepared for the increasing family needs.\r\n\r\nYousra is specialized in making Kishek, a traditional food prepared from groats mixed with skimmed yoghurt and spread over a blanket (after being left for several days in a big pot to keep on mixing and assuring they are in the stage of fermentation), to be exposed to sunlight to dry and then grind them as powder, to be cooked during the winter season by adding it to minced meat, garlic and water. It then looks like a thick, tasty, hot syrup specialized for cold seasons.\r\n\r\nYousra is applying for a YOUTH loan from Kiva partner, Al Majmoua, to buy big quantities of groats, skimmed yoghurt, plastic bags and a few other things to increase her business production. She will work hard to establish her own business outside her house in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":498,"image":{"id":1393538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy necessary raw materials for her business development.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Nabatieh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yousra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728801,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997721,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762334,"comment":null},{"amount":249,"local_amount":249,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":249,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412407,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T19:50:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586195,"name":"Mehwish","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mehwish is a 27-year-old married woman.

He is a very hardworking man and does his best to insure a good harvest, which is sold at local markets. \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is only seasonal from agricultural activities and is not enough for the family, he decided to start his own business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests because of his unstable financial conditions and lack of experience. After several unsuccessful attempts, Besarion applied for credit from MFO Credo. His request was approved in the framework of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative with Kiva permitting the rural poor to start or re-start businesses. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of $3,000, Besarion will open an auto spare parts shop. As the shop is opened, he will be able to generate monthly income and thus improve their living conditions. This credit will be a great support for the family. Besarion is thankful to Kiva lenders for giving him a chance to generate income. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":516.61,"image":{"id":1393544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to open an auto spare parts shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Pachkha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Besarion","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":109.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":113.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":126.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":130.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":132.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":135.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":140.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150.64},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153.6},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.49},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.07},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.89},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.64},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.84,"local_amount":109.84,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":109.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857608,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":97.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134257,"comment":null},{"amount":101.58,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":101.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107839,"comment":null},{"amount":101.83,"local_amount":101.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":101.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255373,"comment":null},{"amount":105.86,"local_amount":105.86,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":105.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019503,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-22T17:32:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586198,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisco is a 47-year-old married man from Talibon, Bohol.

The women average 27 years of age and four children each, all living in Kalaban Coro, in Cercle de Kati (2nd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They know one another through ties of community and through their revenue-generating businesses at the market in Kalaban Coro. The group members have small-scale businesses selling powdered milk, Arab couscous, damask fabrics, and Wax 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa), and they dye cloth.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their capital, the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Fatoumata (sitting first from the right in the photo) is really renowned for her dyed cloth.

She lives in the Senaki District of West Georgia with her grown son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren (three and five years old).  Malina\u2019s son is an artisan and earns a small monthly income. In addition the family grows maize on the family-owned agricultural land and sells the harvest at the local open market. \r\n\r\nMalina has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to her lack of experience in a new business. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. Malina requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-start-up credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Malina will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase the family's income.

When she finished secondary school, she left her hometown in search of better opportunities and with the hope of continuing her studies. However, not everything worked out like she had hoped. After becoming pregnant she needed to look for a way to survive. Under these circumstances, her entrepreneurial spirit woke up and she has gotten through it for her son, averting all obstacles.\r\n\r\nCinthya and her son of just over a year old live in Guaman\u00ed, an area in the south of the city of Quito, capital of the Republic of Ecuador. It is one of the most populated areas in the city and has become highly commercialized, with all types of businesses available to its residents. In recent years the private sector has taken advantage of this growth as an opportunity to increase investment and construct shopping centers, residential compounds, etc. Guaman\u00ed has some security problems because of several night clubs that have opened in recent years, but despite this the people do not lose hope. They can always be found undertaking business ventures that benefit everyone. They believe that the place presents an opportunity for having been the historic home of the Incas and because the local authorities have chosen to improve the sites that hold the city's history and implement more security in the streets.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing the lack of employment available to her due to her lack of education, Cinthya gradually made the decision to start her own business. Three years ago she identified the need for a store in the neighborhood where she lives, and began selling a few basic products as a test. Upon seeing that it was in-demand and well-received by her customers, she rented a room with basic utilities that also had a space in which she could open her store. Here she works from the early hours of the morning until the late hours of the night. The best part is that while she is working she is also able to care for her son and complete household chores. \r\n\r\nCinthya dreams of someday being able to have her own house and see her son grow up in the best conditions possible. It is for this that she strives everyday to improve the service of her business and is learning to manage the resources she has to meet the basic needs of her and her son. With the experience that this young mother has acquired, she would now like to increase the range of products she offers and purchase some essential items that she does not have in stock yet due to lack of capital. For this reason she has requested a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who, through Kiva, will help her finance this phase of business growth. On top of that, it is very motivating to her that throughout the world there are people who believe in the hard-working and entrepreneurial youth of our time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":267.95,"image":{"id":1395719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase essential products for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T17:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T17:20:20Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cinthya Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":821.04,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":53.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":54.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":56.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":58.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.13,"local_amount":96.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":97.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814470,"comment":null},{"amount":56.23,"local_amount":55.96,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":56.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320641,"comment":null},{"amount":114.59,"local_amount":114.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":114.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059907,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T13:50:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586263,"name":"Nazmeen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazmeen is a 50-year-old, married woman.

He is a humble and hardworking man who grows corn, beans, and sorghum. Jos\u00e9's father and siblings taught him to do farm labor when he was a small boy. Jos\u00e9 rose early with his family and worked all day with them. He later learned construction and spends most of his time working in that sector.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 earns income in summer that supports his family. He's now teaching his children to farm and do construction work so they'll be able to support themselves and earn a living through work.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 is applying for a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo [Campo Foundation] to purchase eight bags of manure and other supplies such as herbicides for weed control. The loan funds will allow Jos\u00e9 to plant a good corn crop and achieve a good yield at harvest time. He'll have to travel 16 kilometers in a pickup truck to purchase the supplies. \r\n\r\nThe corn crop currently needs fertilizer to reach Jos\u00e9's projected production and allow him to grow staple grains for his family to eat.

So, Garush is engaged in farming and agriculture and the only person that helps him very much is his wife, who takes care of their children and manages to support him with great help. \r\n\r\nOver time, the main source of income has become farming and agriculture.

She is a fourth-time borrower with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) who has repaid back her past loan completely. The past loan enabled her to support her business promptly. Now she is applying for 1,200,000 KHR while her joint member is seeking 600,000 KHR. As a leader she will spend her loan portion to pay for her plowing fee and to buy potash to boost her cash-crop. She highly believes that she can earn more income to sustain her living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1393519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for the plowing fee and to buy potash to boost her cash-crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T20:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T20:00:36Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tob","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101485.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390697081,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101485.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399943312,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":101485.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410226473,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:47:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101485.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420333432,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101485.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429642618,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":405942.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440092763,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T05:34:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586310,"name":"Mavatey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mavatey, 40, is a parent of two children who are still in school.

38-year-old Patient from Tombo, western rural area in Freetown. She is married with two children between the ages of one year and 15 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2006 she established her garden business. She began her business because her mother was a gardener so she was trained in that; she needs to generate income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nPatient requires a loan in order to buy more garden seeds and waxed cotton for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her level of living. In the future, Patient plans to expand business more than even more.

Dato is very actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has two milking cows, a calf and a pig. Besides the animals, they have 300 nut trees. Dato is a very hardworking man and does his best to insure a good harvest. The harvested nuts are sold at local markets.\r\n\r\nBecause the existing income is seasonal and is not enough for the family, Dato decided to start a new business. All the financial institutions rejected his loan requests, because of his unstable financial condition and lack of experience.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Dato applied for the credit to MFO Credo. His request was approved as part of the Start Up program, which is a joint initiative of Credo and Kiva designed to enable the rural poor to start or restart businesses. With a loan of 3,000 GEL, Dato will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse has been built, he will be able to grow tomatoes, cucumbers and greens. This will increase the income of their family.

She is 43 years old and is a permanent resident of Bolangir town of Odisha, India. The lady sitting third from the left with a raised hand in the photograph is Rupisha. She resides with her husband and one son of 20 years and four daughters of 18, 16, 14 and 10 years in a small mud house.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2010, she, along with five other like-minded women of her locality, formed a group named \u201cMaa Durga\u201d for availing a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to develop her business. To engage herself and earn some income, Rupisha started a dry food-making and selling business five years ago with her own investment. \r\n\r\nThe local name of the dry food is \u201cbadi\u201d. Traditionally, the badis have been prepared by grinding the urad pulse (split black gram dal) in a sil-stone (traditional stone grinder, operated manually). Badi is a food item which can be eaten with rice, even by roasting it in fire. It is also a food item that tastes very good when it is fried with onion and garlic and is eaten with overnight-cooked water rice (pakhala). So, it is very popular in Odisha. \r\n\r\nRupisha prepares six\/seven types of badi and supplies at wholesale to the retailer twice a week. From this business, she earns a monthly income of 7,000 INR. With this small income, she barely manages her family's expenses. So, she wants to increase the volume of her business to earn some extra income. \r\n\r\nTo acquire maximum output, Rupisha wants to purchase a grinder for grinding split black gram dal and purchase two quintals (200 kilograms) of black gram for stock. This will save her time and energy, and also reduce the purchasing cost of black gram. Rupisha is confident enough to have a business of her own and hopes to construct a house. \r\n\r\nThe other five group members are Bishakha, Sukanti, Malti, Sobhagini and Kunti, managing businesses of tailoring centre, vegetable vending, badi\/papad-making and selling, furniture works, and tiffin centre respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1393583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a grinder for grinding split black gram dal, and also purchase two quintal of black gram.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-07-25T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-24T21:00:09Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rupisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bishakha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sukanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sobhagini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kunti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T01:49:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":586312,"name":"Kha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kha is 44 years old and one of the breadwinners in the family consisting of eight children.

She is married to Roberto, a farmer and is the mother of their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nNelia maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nNelia hopes that her business will flourish, and dreams that her children will finish their studies.

Yainkai says that her main business challenges are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nYainkai has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, palm oil, and seasonings.

She has been running this business since 2007. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Kadiatu says that her main business challenges are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, tomatoes, and seasonings. The extra income she expects to generate from this loan will allow her to educate her children and to expand her business. In the future, she plans to build a house. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1393857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase additional food-related items (e.g., rice, tomatoes, and seasonings).

Pacto est\u00e1 ubicado en el noroccidente del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, su historia inicia en la \u00e9poca preincaica y su nombre se deriva de acuerdos realizados entre partidos pol\u00edticos importantes. En cuanto a su econom\u00eda, es una zona agr\u00edcola y ganadera, debido a su situaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica y geogr\u00e1fica, lo cual tambi\u00e9n produce efecto en las cosechas de las cuales se obtiene productos de la Regi\u00f3n Costa como de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra.

She has two children who are five and two years old. She has for some time had to raise her children by herself, because she has had to overcome the death of her husband, who was as young as she. Now she is a widow, but she is working hard to get ahead and provide for her children. She lives with her children in the parish of Pacto, which is in the canton of Quito in the province of Pichincha in the Republic of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nPacto is located in the northwest of the Metropolitan District of Quito. Its history began in the Pre-Incan period and its name comes from agreements reached among important political parties. Its economy is based on agriculture and livestock, due to its climate and geography. The agricultural products of the area come from both the coastal region and the highlands region, and the people of Pacto make their livelihoods from these activities. Although far from the city, families in the area have undertaken all kinds of economic activities to provide for their needs and for those of their communities.\r\n\r\nGloria helped her husband for three years with their sugarcane crops, and she now grows sugarcane to provide for her family. She says that the education she received in primary school has helped her a lot with negotiating and selling her products. Gloria would like to grow her business to offer her children a better life, and it is for this reason that she wants to increase the size of her crops. She plans to buy seeds and other agricultural inputs to increase the size of her sugarcane fields.
