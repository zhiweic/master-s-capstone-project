is Sofia, 59, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Tomas, her business partner, and is a mother to six children. Together, Sofia and Tomas work hard to provide a safe and secure future for their family.\r\nSofia operates a piggery business. Live pigs are raised, slaughtered, and then sold to members of the immediate community. Sofia has many customers who also buy live pigs to be sold in the market. Many customers prefer Sofia\u2019s products since they are assured of their quality. It is also a little cheaper to buy live pigs directly from her. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. Sofia earns a minimum of 550 PHP in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Sofia is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy additional hogs and feed needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nSofia hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day, and able to finish their studies.

Dice que le gusta mucho su trabajo porque tiene tiempo de atender a sus hijos ya que desde muy temprano sale a vender sus frutos y ya en la tarde est\u00e1 desocupada para hacer los quehaceres de su casa. Ella est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas el cual tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de frutas, ellos tiene dos hijos de nombres Eduardo de 9 a\u00f1os estudiante de primaria y Mayra de 18 a\u00f1os la cual estudia la preparatoria.

For seven years she has been renting avocado and peach orchards whose fruit she picks and then sells in the local wholesale food market by the bucket.  She says that she really enjoys her work because it leaves her time to care for her children as she goes out very early in the morning to sell her fruit and in the afternoon she is free to do her housework.\r\n\r\nTrinidad is married to Jes\u00fas who also sells fruit.  The couple have two children: 9-year-old Eduardo who is in elementary school and 18-year-old Mayra who is in high school.  Trinidad says that she is requesting a loan so that she can rent an additional orchard which will make her a little more profit so that she can have a little more money saved up for dealing with any emergencies that her daughter or any other members of her family might experience.  Trinidad's daughter Mayra has suffered from childhood-onset diabetes since she was 11 years old and she has to be alert because sometimes her blood sugar levels rise.  She has to keep control of the situation, both in terms of what she eats and her medication, so that she doesn't fall ill because medicines are very expensive.  Trinidad's goal is to own her own orchard.  She would like to buy a large plot of land where she can grow a little of all the fruits that grow in her region.\r\n\r\nThe other five members of this group are Clementina, Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica, Clara and Estela.  They will invest their loans in buying organic fertilizers and insecticides for their avocado orchards.  They will also buy chickens and lambs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4125,"image":{"id":1018014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Land Rental","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to rent land which has avocados, peaches and guava growing on it","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-07T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-06T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clementina Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Trinidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":53000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3133.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3364.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3436.62},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3510.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3586.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3663.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3742.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3823.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3906.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3990.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4076.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4164.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4254.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4346.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.02},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":324.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":505.67,"local_amount":6497.13,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":6505.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044507,"comment":null},{"amount":540.72,"local_amount":6947.39,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6956.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656698,"comment":null},{"amount":564.3,"local_amount":7250.42,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":7259.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317370,"comment":null},{"amount":588.92,"local_amount":7566.66,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7576.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418757,"comment":null},{"amount":931.88,"local_amount":11973.27,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11989.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568372,"comment":null},{"amount":993.51,"local_amount":12765.13,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12781.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399753,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-09T00:08:44Z","paid_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398720,"name":"Lux Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luz es madre soltera, tiene dos hijos, desde hace unos 10 a\u00f1os ella se dedica a su negocio de Pulper\u00eda donde vende todo tipo de productos como ser arroz, frijoles, az\u00facar, huevos, pan, leche, productos de uso personal, \u00fatiles escolares entre otros, ella realiza sus compras en el mercado de la comunidad, sus clientes son sus vecinos, su negocio esta abierto de lunes a domingo.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nKatlyn hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and dreams of sending her child to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives in Telpaneca, Esteli.  She is the mother of 3 children.  She started this business with a loan that that she was given.  She recalls that it was very small, and was used to buy some supplies since she lacked working capital.  Prior to this business, she used to sell clothing and enchiladas from place to place, but she realized that by selling tortillas she could earn a better income more rapidly than she did by selling clothing.  She gets up very early to work in her humble kitchen so that she can have the hot tortillas ready to sell to her customers, who seek her tortillas for their breakfast to eat with cheese curds and a cup of coffee.  She wants to use this loan to buy corn, firewood and limes, which are the supplies she needs in making tortillas.  This will also help her to have an inventory of supplies available for those times when these supplies increase in price.  In the future she expects to make improvements to her house, by fixing up the kitchen where she makes her tortillas.

The loans have helped her to grow her rice seasonably and to have a standard lifestyle. Bak can now save about US $3.50 per day.  She is requesting a new loan of 1,400,000 KHR for her sixth cycle. As the group leader, she will use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes to grow her rice healthfully and receive more crop yield.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1019973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bory","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1600000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1400000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283266684,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":800000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118449,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":600000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339640721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T03:51:24Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399654,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 42 years old, married with 4 children.

This business provides many services including remodeling, roofing repairs, and window replacement for residential and commercial building projects. Recently, Julio has also moved his business into providing services for government projects. This shift, however, has proven to be very difficult, as well as a growing point for his business. The government projects pay the private businesses that provide the service after completion and this has exhausted much of the business' resources.

He is part of the Las Abejitas Trabajadoras (The Little Worker Bees) group, and he says they gave themselves this nickname because they are very hard workers willing to fight for a better life. Jorge has made a living baking bread for more than four years after a friend taught him the trade at a time in his life when he didn't have a job and had to make headway for his son, so his friend offered to teach him. Jorge says that he is requesting this loan to purchase ingredients to bake bread, such as milk, eggs, flour, firewood, sugar, butter and other times. He sells the bread in different stores in town. The stores make their orders, and he delivers the bread very early. He is very excited about the loan because it will increase his sales as he will invest a little more in the ingredients. One of his goals is to purchase a motor-scooter so he can make his deliveries more quickly and be able to sell his products on the city streets. The other members of the group are Cristina, Elizabeth, Rosa, Mariana, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Adriana, Teresa, Alma Delia, Sandra, Georgina and Yazmin, and they plan to invest their loans in the businesses, such as furniture making, selling fruits and candies, sewing handicrafts, selling party supplies, selling perfumes, making tamales, selling quilts via catalog, and selling women's cosmetics via catalog.

Keu is a 51-year-old married woman who has been living in the rural area of Prey Chhor district in Kompong Cham province. Mrs. Keu is a local farmer and she has had experience in this sector for many years. Mrs. Keu always plants her rice crop on her existing farmland and earns an income of approximately USD 1.50 each day. Her husband also assists her in the rice field.

People also meet at his place to enjoy their time with friends, play internet games, and get a coffee.

For much of her life she has done various types of work to provide her children with a good education and quality of life. Now her children have professions and are independent. In the meantime she lives in her own house, with her husband and one of her daughters.\r\n\r\nLourdes sells meals, which she does on the porch of her house. She has her daughter's help, with whom she has been working in this business for almost two years now. During this time she has learned many things; from how to treat customers to how to have very good seasoning that makes grilled fish delicious and juicy; and to offer her diners juanes (pieces of meat with rice, wrapped in banana leaves) that are the most delicious in the area where she lives. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work since she can enjoy herself at the same time as she generates income. In addition, she really likes working alongside her daughter, who is her main support in the business. The business is located in a very busy avenue, so she always has customers to whom she offers the best. They  go away delighted with the friendliness of the service, and with how affordable the prices are. She wishes to continue working, and later on, continue expanding her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP, so she is hoping for your help so that she can continue toward her goals. Moreover, she promises to once again make her installment payments on time, and demonstrate, as on earlier occasions, that she is a very good member. In this way she will repay the support that they provide her in her communal bank, where everyone is very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nWith the 1,500 nuevos soles applied for, she will buy ingredients, supplies, and a few cooking utensils in order to continue doing her work. In addition, she will add a few tables and chairs to be able to give more comfort to her customers when she is serving them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1017793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy food and cooking utensils for preparing more meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T04:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":220.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":229.18},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":249.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":263.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":277.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.67,"local_amount":220.88,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":226.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099873,"comment":null},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":229.18,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714004,"comment":null},{"amount":95.79,"local_amount":249.89,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":256.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202901,"comment":null},{"amount":99.37,"local_amount":259.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098571,"comment":null},{"amount":101.09,"local_amount":263.73,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":270.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401411,"comment":null},{"amount":106.23,"local_amount":277.11,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":284.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T04:42:13Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399708,"name":"Prum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prum, 42, is married with four single children.

This will enable her to teach indigenous children who speak <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mazahua_language\" target=\"_blank\" >Mazahua<\/a> since this is the predominant culture and language in her community.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol is married to Sr. Constantino and has two children, a daughter in fifth grade and a son who is in second grade.  She and her husband buy and sell scrap iron that is brought in every day from the neighboring areas around her town.  These items include doors, batteries, radiators, and other objects.  Marisol sells all of these items in the town of Hidalgo since there is a recycling center that buys iron and scrap metal.  She says that she and her husband decided to start this business because he was involved in a serious accident at a sawmill.  Since he was not able to continue working, they decided to sell iron that could be sold at a later time.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol is requesting a loan to buy iron and gasoline for transporting the iron.  One of her worries is her older daughter who occasionally suffers from asthma attacks.  For this reason, she and her husband must work very hard in order to buy the medicines needed to keep her illness under control.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarisol says that one of her goals is to buy another truck that will help her husband buy and sell iron in other communities.

One of the things she does not like are the times when her crops are not cared for properly and are therefore affected by pests. She remembers with sadness the time that she lost almost all of her crops, however, with experience that life has given her, she continues to work. The majority of the time she has had a good income through her sales. \r\n\r\nIn addition, she has five large cows and three little ones that provide milk with which she make cheese.

Octavia Q. - 35 years old - will use her money to buy two pigs and eight turkeys, as well as feed and corn with which to fatten them, so that she can later sell them.\r\n\r\nThe group's representative is called Irma and she is 35 years old.  She has been married to Antonio for 19 years.  Antonio carries out building jobs in their community.  The couple have five children.  Their eldest is a son who is 19 years old, single, and currently works.  Next they have a daughter called Rosaura who isn't currently studying.  They also have a 10-year-old son who is in fifth grade, an 8-year-old who is in third grade and their youngest who is a 2-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nIrma is requesting this loan so that she can start buying and selling animals such as pigs and chickens.  She decided to join this group because she was invited by a neighbor and also because she was very keen to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nIrma says that she will carry out her business in the following way: once she has received her loan, she will buy her young animals in her community and take them home.  She says that she would like to set up a small pen where she can raise them appropriately.  She has great faith that this will be a good business and will help her to improve her family's life if it goes well.  Once she has her animals home, she will buy them feed and ground corn so that they grow.  She will later sell them and recoup what she invested.  She says that she will sell the animals in her community without having to travel far.  She is very happy to be able to receive this loan as she says that previously, owing to a lack of money, she couldn't even imagine managing to start something like this.  Irma describes herself as a very respectful and hard-working person.  \"I like to help my husband because there are no jobs here and we have to find a way to make progress\", comments Irma.  This loan, without doubt, will help her to start her business and improve her life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1018726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044511,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656702,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317374,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3525.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418760,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-10T01:31:53Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399118,"name":"Huitzililla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Cruz va a comprar perfumes y cosmeticos, la se\u00f1ora Eleuteria va a comprar sorgo y maiz molido, la se\u00f1ora Tomasa va a comprar pan, mayonesa, jamon, verduras para preparar tortas, el resto de las integrantes siguen en su actividad que vienen desarrollando.

This group is made up of nine very hard-working and cheerful women who make their sales in order to earn a little extra money and provide their children with a better quality of life.  They live in a community which is noted for being in a sugarcane region.  Their husbands work in the fields (sowing and cutting sugarcane).\r\n\r\nObdulia is 41 years old and studied up to high school level.  She is a single mother and has three children.  Her eldest child is called Karen and she is 19 years old.  She is studying at university.  15-year-old Brenda is in high school and 9-year-old Luis Angel is in elementary school.  Obdulia tells us that she has always had to work to provide for her children and pay for their education.  A little over 10 years ago she started selling chicken together with her friends and neighbors in her community.  However, over time, and as a result of the hard work her whole family has carried out in order to get themselves ahead in life, they have managed to become suppliers.  They currently supply chicken to all the ladies who sell in their community.  The work that Obdulia and her family carry out requires a lot of effort and work as they must get up at 5 o'clock in the morning to start seasoning the chicken which they then go out to deliver to their customers.  She says that she sells more and more every day and that her business is gradually growing.  Obdulia needs this loan to invest in buying more chickens so that she can continue making her sales.\r\n\r\nObdulia hopes that this investment will allow her business to continue making progress as she would like her business to continue growing so that she can pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nMinerva - bakery\r\nEsther - selling groceries\r\nFlor - selling corn\r\nMadai - selling corncobs and fruit\r\nLeticia - selling clothing\r\nMaria - selling sweet treats\r\nAtanacia - selling tacos\r\nCristina - selling groceries\r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they are providing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1017982,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tembladera Vista Hermosa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-08T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-07T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Atanacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madai De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3375},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":796.88,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044513,"comment":null},{"amount":531.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":6810.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656704,"comment":null},{"amount":796.87,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10215.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317376,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T16:56:48Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T17:05:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399121,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Wimpillay - Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR DE WIMPILLAY - II\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco. \nLa socia es la Sra.

This town is noted for the high level of commercial activity among its residents.  In the surrounding area one finds the Ungara Fortress, the last trace of the Huarco culture, ancient Ca\u00f1ete.  There are also old haciendas on vast expanses of farmland.\r\n\r\nNestor is the father of two young children who are 11 and 12 years old.  He loves his children very much.  The children's mother left him several years ago and he had to start a new life in order to provide for his children.  He works hard for his children every day so that he can provide them with the best in life.  Nestor studied auto mechanics.  As he also enjoyed photography, he signed up for a course and bought a camera but one day he was mugged and lost the camera.  This meant he was not longer able to continue studying.\r\n\r\nNestor currently works very hard as a motorcycle taxi driver.  He works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 50 customers a day.  Sometimes he also works on construction sites because he tells us that every job is good, especially when it is honest.  Nestor believes that his business is doing well.  He works hours that allow him to transport a lot more passengers and spend more time with his children.\r\n\r\nNestor is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he will be able to build a garage.  This improvement will provide him with a safe place to keep his motorcycle taxi and he will no longer have to keep it elsewhere which will give him more money and he will be able to continue working towards his biggest dream: to provide his children with a good education and improve their quality of

After seeing no future in his town, he decided to move a few years later to Mexico City where he enrolled in beauty school and learned the skills of the trade very well.  As a young boy, he enjoyed giving haircuts so he chose this career because he saw that it would be a good business.  He now has an aesthetics practice in town that he started seven years ago.  One of his challenges is being able to pay the rent since the rates have gotten so high.  Rodrigo says that he is requesting a loan to buy beauty products such as cr\u00e8mes, makeup, nail polish for manicures and pedicures, shampoo, dyes, bleaches, and liquid products used on the hair.  He indicates that all of the products that are used on his customers are purchased in Mexico City from different stores that offer low prices.  This allows him to earn some profit.  Rodrigo is married to Sra. Yunuen and has a child in elementary school.  One of his dreams is to open a shop in his home so that he can avoid paying rent.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other group members are Irma, Teresa, Eduardo, Beatriz Elizabeth, Maria Alejandra, Pablo, Janet, and Olga.

She believes that business is good because she is very well-known and provides good customer service. \nAna would like to thank the Kiva lenders because with their support, she will be able to fix the roof of the garage by purchasing a tarp, thus allowing her to offer a better service, especially since winter is approaching and the vehicles will get more protection from the weather. That way, she will continue working so that she can reach her biggest dream: to help her children finish their education.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1018066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to
