He lives in his own home, located in one of the settlements that make up the rural part of the farming district of Tambogrande, in Piura region. The quality of life in the area is quite precarious, but it has electricity.\r\n\r\nHis business is farming, and he has a piece of farmland where he has planted mango and lemon that are in production. Both products are typical of the area, and are exported to other countries through associations of small producers. In the same way, they also supply the domestic market. In addition, he raises smaller livestock such as pigs and poultry, and when they attain ideal size and weight, he sells them in the local market. \r\n\r\nSantos is requesting a loan of 1,200 nuevos

Badri and his sister are unemployed. Badri requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a small scale business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the pension of Badri\u2019s father and financial assistance from his mother. The total average monthly income of the family doesn\u2019t exceed 300 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations, Badri\u2019s family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nBadri requested a loan from Credo to start up a joiner\u2019s workshop. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Badri will supply them with quality furniture for a convenient price. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will increase the income of the family by 100%.

As the main source of income for her family, Gulnara works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulnara's persistent work, her farm today has two cows and further 2.40 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 2,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulnara turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of sheep and goats. Gulnara plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, in order to have an opportunity to pay for the education of her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1129632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

of three children. Kulsaada works with maintenance at the local military base. As an additional source of income for her family, she has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1987, after having started this business with the purchase of a calf. Thanks to Kulsaada's persistent work, her farm currently has two cows and further 1.60 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 8,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Kulsaada turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of sheep and goats. Kulsaada plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, in order to be able to pay for her children's education.

As a main source of income for her family, Gulmira has been engaged in livestock breeding and field crop cultivation since 1980, after having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Gulmira's persistent work, her farm currently has 5 sheep, 2 cows and further 3.12 hectares of land, where she grows perennial herbs and potatoes. The sale of milk and dairy products brings in around 17,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulmira turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of cattle. Gulmira plans to invest the income from the loan in further developing her business, and she dreams of buying a car for her family in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1129672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Jumagul is 63 years old, a widow, and has six children. In 1997, in search of a source of income for her family, Jumagul started her business of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation with a starting sum of 3,000 som (KGS). Thanks to perseverance and persistent work, Jumagul was able to develop her business to a farm numbering two cows with offspring, 10 heads of sheep and goats and 4.34 hectares of irrigated land with beans and potatoes. The monthly income is around 5,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Jumagul turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of sheep and goats and fertilizer. Jumagul plans to invest the income from the loan in the reconstruction of the

","en":"Marly thas a store where she sells boxed lunches, groceries, beverages, meat, etc. wholesale. In her neighborhood she is well known and her customers are regulars because she works hard to offer then quality service. She started this business 20 years ago when she lived with her husband, because he had the same type of business. When they separated, she had to look for an alternative to generate enough income to support her 8 children who now are aged 29 to 41. She started selling raffle tickets at a gaming house. Three years ago she was given a display case and later, thinking that her house is on a corner, it occurred to her to open a store. She bought some second hand shelves, taking advantage of the fact that this opportunity existed. With some savings she was able to get together, she stocked her store  with the most popular items, although she had very little working capital. With the help of her daughter, who tended the store while Marly kept working selling raffle tickets, she was able to buy her first refrigerated case and little by little she has stocked her store more. Everything has been due to her hard work, dedication and experience. Today her store is well known in the neighborhood and beyond. She needs a freezer, because she needs to buy meats wholesale and add fish as a new product to offer. She doesn't have anywhere to keep them. That is the reason she is asking for a Kiva loan, the first loan that she has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy a freezer.

She learned this art from her mother, who was an expert and started teaching her the trade when she was very young. That is why twelve years ago she decided to use her knowledge to generate her own income, by selling backpacks initially, and gradually hammocks.\r\nThis business has allowed her to contribute to support her family and give them what they need. Her goal and her greatest challenge is having her own capital in order to sell a greater number of hammocks, so that she can help her children even more. \r\nArgeda approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request a Kiva loan because it will allow her to try to gradually increase her working capital by investing in greater amounts of cotton and pine thread for making new hammocks. That way she will build an inventory and will be able to respond to her customers appropriately when they approach her ready to pay. \r\nArgeda is very well-known in San Jacinto for her products' excellent finish. That is why her customers recommend her, and her potential for growth is worth exploring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1129104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase greater amounts of pine and cotton thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T15:40:08Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argeda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90721},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92060},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94209},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96407},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":98656},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100958},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":103314},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":105725},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108191},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":109759}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":90721,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":92852.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338934,"comment":null},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":92060,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395505,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94209,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":96422.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775290,"comment":null},{"amount":55.43,"local_amount":96407,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":98672.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387294,"comment":null},{"amount":56.73,"local_amount":98656,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100974.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994122,"comment":null},{"amount":58.05,"local_amount":100958,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103330.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130482,"comment":null},{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":103314,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:12Z","rounded_local_amount":105741.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519356,"comment":null},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":105725,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":108209.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071196,"comment":null},{"amount":62.21,"local_amount":108191,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":110733.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497413,"comment":null},{"amount":63.11,"local_amount":109759,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":112338.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-30T20:58:48Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444450,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe, age 57, prepares and sells snacks in her local community to earn a living.

For the past 10 years, Sebana has been working hard to manage his retail shop, where he sells general items.\r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Sebana has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to add more stock to his business, and will help Sebana to generate greater profits and add more stock. Sebana hopes that in the future he will be able to have all goods that customers come in looking for.\r\n\r\nSebana is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Sebana who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1129516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to add more stock to his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lyantonde","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T16:00:07Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444469,"name":"Jonathan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonathan, age 44, is a milk vendor.

Other financing institutions were too far away and demand too many prerequisites. \r\n\r\nOne of Felix's dreams is to construct his own house, which  may be achieved with the help of the present loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1130981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2012-06-30T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-30T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":242.64,"local_amount":1673.37,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1688.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331103836,"comment":null},{"amount":243.49,"local_amount":1679.21,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382130857,"comment":null},{"amount":238.87,"local_amount":1647.42,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1662.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439709640,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-10T04:39:45Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:25:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441897,"name":"Berdi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 12 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0446\u044b, \u0434\u044b\u043d\u044e \u0438 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 2 \u0433\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0439. \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0443 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438.","en":"Berdi has been farming for 12 years.

When her mother died, Sandra became responsible for the business. She has 22 years of experience now and is fully qualified. She works alone and has no one else to help her manage. She sells her products on the outskirts of the community. Her husband is a salaried worker; his income covers some of the household expenses. Sandra would like to set up her shop at home so that she could spend more time with her daughter. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy bread, which is a popular product in the area. Sandra believes that this loan will help her earn more income by providing her clients with a wider variety of products.

is 50 years old, single and has no children. Even though this can often be seen as a negative situation where she is from, she has demonstrated her will to prosper and work hard. Indeed, this is now the second loan Fanny takes from Edpyme Alternative with the support of Kiva, having had a good experience her first time around.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own house, with her mother in the district of Tambogrande, Northern Peru. They do not have the basic services of  water or electricity in her community. Fanny has two main sources of income. On the one hand, she sells cosmetics which has proven a succesful idea.

For the past two years, Jamadah has been working hard to manage his hardware business selling cement and other building materials. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Jamadah has requested a loan of 2,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more cement, and will help Jamadah to generate greater profits to expand the business. Jamadah hopes that in the future he will be able to increase his income. \r\n\r\nJamadah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Her family owns a house which is built from wood, but it has air leaks through the walls and corners. That is the main reason why it costs too much for coal and other fuels, so she wants to repair her house walls by adding insulation. She needs some building materials such as bricks, cement, rock wool and other insulation materials. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. As well, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

Mahsuda's husband is moving away from home to earn money for his family, and she is also working hard to do her part. Last year's profits allowed Mahsuda to hold traditional circumcision ceremonies for her children. Her son recently underwent major surgery, and a large part of the profits was used to cover his medical expenses. Mahsuda's life has brought her many trials, but she overcame them and kept her poise.

He was divorced many years ago, and now lives alone in the ger district (ger is a Mongolian nomadic traditional yurt) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. All of his children have already moved out the home. But one of his sons took over his craft skills and he wants to transfer his business to his son. \r\n\r\nNow he needs to renovate some of his craft tools and equipment due to age and wear of all of them. He is planning to replace his coal firing stove with an electric stove, which costs very little to use and is harmless to the environment. He uses it to burn and produce raw materials for making his crafts. A stove costs a lot in the Mongolian market. Batsukh thinks it will stop the extremely harmful coal usage if he purchases an electric stove for his business.

This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I learned by watching my father at work, as well as from watching other artisans in my village. I enjoyed creating my own pieces and eventually decided to be immersed in the wonderful world of jewelry. I'm motivated by a desire to highlight women's beauty and personality through my designs and creations. I have the best job in the world, and I give it my all through patience, love and hard work in order to obtain the best quality possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're approaching that time of the year when it's our highest selling season, and I would like to be prepared for it.

His crops are grown on two plots of land, one that measures five hectares and another that measures three hectares, which he inherited from his parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Julian and his wife have a son who is disabled.  Throughout the year, they must pay for expenses related to his hospital treatments and other services.  For this reason, they need a loan in order to buy organic compost and potato seedlings.  The planting season has arrived and they are in urgent need of these supplies.  Sr. Julian is encouraged by the idea of being able to contribute to the welfare of his family by increasing their income, especially for the purpose of paying his son\u2019s medical expenses.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":984.74,"image":{"id":1130990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy potato seedlings and organic compost.

El pr\u00e9stamo que francisca solicita lo necesita para invertirlo en la compra de productos como ser: arroz, az\u00facar, frijoles, manteca, jab\u00f3n, sal, dulces, churros, refrescos, entre otros. Con la ayuda de este pr\u00e9stamo ella tendr\u00e1 mayor surtido su negocio y podr\u00e1 ofrecerles a sus clientes todo lo que necesiten. Su meta es hacer crecer m\u00e1s su pulper\u00eda y tener gran variedad de productos para satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes y que con las ganancias poder cubrir los gastos familiares. Francisca ha solicitado tres pr\u00e9stamos en FAMA y hasta el momento ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente.

She started the business two years ago, with a small loan started buying household products to sell. Little by little with the profits, she bought more products until she open a general store. She learned from her parents, whom make a living in the business. \r\n\r\nShe opens from 5:00am to 10:00pm. Her advantage is that there is no competition as a result has many customers. One of her difficulties is that she has to travel to the city to buy the merchandise because the providers don\u2019t come to her community. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy products such as: rice, sugar, beans, butter, soap, salt, candies, soft-drinks, among others.

His siblings are students and his mom is a housewife. He is a friendly, respectful, hardworking, and very determined person. He began his business two years ago with some small savings he had. He began by buying some household products and little by little he stocked his business until he converted it into a local store. Currently he makes a living selling general groceries and began the business by his own initiative. His work schedule is from 6:00am to 8:00pm and he does this by himself.
