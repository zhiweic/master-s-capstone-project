Together with her husband, she manages their  household while operating their business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Nena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, some cooking oil, or an egg. Maria Nena earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells directly for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Maria Nena is requesting a loan for 14,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Nena hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the study of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1006722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is Helen, 42, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Romeo, a mechanic and father to her children. Together with her husband, Helen manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She is married to Rodolfo, her business partner and father to her two children. Together with her husband, Maria Corazon manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Corazon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Corazon hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week; there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1006741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Corazon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275540,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2844.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997960,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606499,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095360,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T22:01:15Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T11:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392630,"name":"Lien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lien is 44 years old with two children who are grown.

","en":"Ibrohim has been a client of our organization since April of 2011.  He is a nurse practitioner at the district hospital.

Happily, three of her six children are already grown while she strives to support the other three and provide them a better quality of life.  Of these three children, Cristian is the youngest who lives with her.  Ana\u2019s work consists of making cakes and cupcakes on a daily basis, selling them from her home, and completing orders she receives.  Her shop is in her house and is very modest.  Despite this obstacle, she performs very good work and always has orders and customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna has been in this line of work for 30 years and has the help of her two daughters who assist with daily production.  She has done very well as a result of her many orders.  In order to keep all of her customers happy, she must finish all of their orders and provide a high-quality product.  She has many plans for the future, but her greatest wish is to have a larger shop and to keep making high-quality products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  Ana is very pleased to be given financial backing so that she can increase her operating capital.  She knows that she must be responsible and always punctual.  The amount of 600 PEN that she is requesting will be used to buy ingredients and supplies so that she can continue her work.  In addition, some of her materials need to be replaced since they have started to deteriorate over time.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1002499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients, supplies, and utensils.

","en":"Matluba is a woman, who is involved in sewing dresses.  She sews to-order for her friends.  Matluba has two adult sons, who work as plasterers, and her husband is disabled and stays home.

He is a cattle breeder and has five years of experience in this field. Elkhan chose this particular activity because meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and most of the national dishes like dolma and pilau are made of meat. Also Elkhan keeps cows for milk and yoghurt sales.\n\nElkhan usually buys small calves in the central bazaar, fattens and raises them for 5-6 months. Then, he resells the grown cattle at a more profitable price to market vendors and butchers.

responsible and hard working.  She has 4 children, of whom only one is dependent on her; the rest work on their own.  She lives with her husband in a rural area of Olmos named \u201cFiloque Grande\u201d, which is only a few minutes from the district of Olmos and approximately 2 hours from the city of Lambayeque.\r\n\r\nBecause Clara is a hard-working woman who fights to meet her goals, over time, she has managed to save money she obtained from her previous work in farming.  She bought two moto taxis with the money she saved, and now rents them out to transport passengers from town to town.  This work generates her income on a daily basis and she projects that, over time, she will purchase two more vehicles, which is something she is already working towards.\r\n\r\nHer husband, like her, is committed to the goal of succeeding, which is why he works independently as a master builder throughout the zone where they live.

It is a small factory where she makes and sells snacks.  She works every day from 6 in the morning making snacks with the help of two other people who she pays a weekly salary and later with the help of her grandson.

That is why she is applying to Edpyme for a loan in the amount of 1,500 nuevos soles, with which she will be able to meet her objectives. \r\n\r\nNelly is a young professional thanks to her parents' help, so she is interested in paying back their efforts by working responsibly, and so improving not only her parents' quality of life, but also that of her child."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1004101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To buy medicines and construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":114.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":115.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":128.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":136.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":139.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":143.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":147.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.81,"local_amount":106.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":109.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012140,"comment":null},{"amount":39.19,"local_amount":102.25,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":105.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621258,"comment":null},{"amount":43.86,"local_amount":114.4,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:21:10Z","rounded_local_amount":117.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332627,"comment":null},{"amount":44.17,"local_amount":115.25,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":118.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423418,"comment":null},{"amount":45.62,"local_amount":119,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":122.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316816,"comment":null},{"amount":46.71,"local_amount":121.85,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":125.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373660,"comment":null},{"amount":314.64,"local_amount":820.8,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":844.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308384928,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T00:32:28Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392686,"name":"Batirhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batirhan is 54 years old and lives with his wife and two kids in a ger (Mongolian yurt) in Bayan-Ulgii province in western Mongolia.

Since then he has been doing this work, traveling the streets of the city of Pucallpa, looking for clients and carrying them to their destination safely. He enjoys his work because it provides an income and enables him to have a job since he went a long time without a job formerly. He feels his business is sufficiently profitable because of the demand for transportation in the city and because he earns a good income. Consequently he plans to expand his business and hopes to buy another motor taxi and thus generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP and he hopes for your collaboration so that he can continue to meet his goals. With the 1,000 nuevos soles requested, he will buy spare parts for maintenance of his motor taxi and pay for the services of a mechanic.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1004237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase spare parts and pay a mechanic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T01:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debner ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":147.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":160.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":159.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":178.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.44,"local_amount":147.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":148.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386529,"comment":null},{"amount":60.04,"local_amount":160.12,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":161.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099652,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":160.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713791,"comment":null},{"amount":64.51,"local_amount":172.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":173.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202683,"comment":null},{"amount":66.93,"local_amount":178.46,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":179.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098364,"comment":null},{"amount":68.26,"local_amount":182.04,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":183.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T02:11:41Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392703,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta is 28 years old.

The union of Jose and his wife has meant that they have defined some new goals for their family, and it is for this reason that they both work each day in order to achieve them and in this way improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nJose, with clear and established goals, wants to buy animal feed to fatten his animals, and he also wants to buy more animals with the objective of increasing his sales.  Jose has requested a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles, which will help him to increase his income so that he can improve his quality of life, and at the same time, pay back the loan he is requesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1004125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock and animal feed   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":113.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":118},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":122.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":138.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":144.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":147.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":107.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012142,"comment":null},{"amount":40.39,"local_amount":105.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621260,"comment":null},{"amount":43.39,"local_amount":113.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":116.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332629,"comment":null},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":114.15,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":117.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423420,"comment":null},{"amount":407.23,"local_amount":1062.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316818,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T09:19:59Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392733,"name":"Estela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Estela, 52, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

She lives with her partner, Elar, with whom she has a family business, and who is the father of her children. Together they live in their own house, but every weekend their children who are already adults and independent visit her. Llerme's business activities include the sale of soft drinks and candies. Similarly, she has as a family business an upholstery workshop, where her partner takes charge of the business. Both businesses are located in their house, in this way they save the expense of renting a shop. She has been working in these businesses for more than two years with the help of an assistant in the upholstery shop, who is paid for each job completed. She feels that her business is quite profitable because of the good earnings that it yields. For that reason she has plans to expand her business and enter into others, such as opening a tourist restaurant and doing this on their own land. Thus she will be able to generate more income. This will be her 11th loan with the MFP institution, so she hopes for your assistance to continue with her goals.

All three are studying in high school. Her husband has a cobbling factory and is a bricklayer. \r\n\r\nAngela got a degree in educational science and works as a teacher in a nearby school, but to help her husband she has asked for the loan so he can use it in his business. He will put it towards the creation and sale of pavement (material used for the construction of streets and sidewalks.) He works from Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. making and selling pavement. He sells to individual people as well as to public institutions that need this material. In the afternoons, she helps him more than anything doing sales and accounting for the small business. She works with two people who he pays a weekly salary. He has had this business for more than 10 years and it is going very well for him.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of cement, sand, and other materials necessary for the production of pavement. She has been a part of the Communal Bank for more than 7 years and she likes it because of the way the bank works.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that the business will grow more every day.

She lives comfortably in her parents' home with Eli, who works and is the father of her 8-year-old son. She makes a living in transportation with a moto-taxi business. She started with a family loan three years ago and pays it back on a daily basis. In this way she has kept the business growing and now has three moto-taxis. She counts on the support of her partner, who helps administer the vehicles. She likes the business because it generates income and she feels productive supporting Eli with household expenses. On the other hand, she doesn't like it when it rains a lot because it makes the roads difficult and the moto-taxis go slower. She has plans of adding another business, like opening a shop for spare parts. This will be her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she awaits your collaboration so she can solidify her plans. She enjoys being part of her community bank because it is a united group.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo,  PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.   Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Aida is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan.  She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAida hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1006894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T06:50:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6822.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275550,"comment":null},{"amount":160,"local_amount":6666,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":6821.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997964,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8334,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8528.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606503,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3410.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095364,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T09:50:13Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:15:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392754,"name":"Dannis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dannis is a 25-year-old gentleman from Migori County, west of Kenya and is married to Susan.

is a student applying for a loan to pay tuition fees to help her finish her undergraduate degree at Strathmore University and this is her story:\r\n\r\nMy name is Seraphine. I am currently a third year student at Strathmore University pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Hospitality Management. I have been performing well at Strathmore University with my second year transcript showing an average grade of A. \r\n\r\nI come from a single parent family with my father being the sole breadwinner. He is a small-scale businessman working in the transport sector in Nairobi. I have four siblings who are still in school. This puts an even greater strain on my family's finances, as I am the firstborn.\r\n\r\nI also make time to volunteer at a local charity's children\u2019s home. The experience helps to further develop my interpersonal skills as well as giving me an opportunity to give back to society. Moreover, I have part-time jobs at well-known 4 star hotels to help with my upkeep and grow my work experience by honing important skills.\r\n\r\nI know that I have great potential despite the financial limitations I currently face, as my consistently good academic performance can attest. Given the opportunity to finish my degree course at Strathmore University, I believe I will graduate as a better, more professional member of society having acquired new skills and become more ethically responsible. I am striving to be an entrepreneur in the hospitality sector and to help others in need.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElvera dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a widow and she lives with her 27 year-old son. They live comfortably in their own house that Flor bought with her deceased husband. Flor sells food, especially lunch, to workers at a business near her house. She prepares the food in her home and then brings it to the business at their break hour. She came to win the workers' favor with her good flavors. People recommended her to others and after a time, she had developed regular customers. Flor has been running this business for over ten years and up to this point, her son has been her greatest support. He helps deliver the food once it's prepared and helps bring in new customers.\r\n\r\nFlor likes this business because it generates good income and allows her to have a job and to feel like a productive person. She also comments that thanks to this work, she has been able to support her household after being widowed. She considers her business to be profitable because of the good earnings she's left with. Therefore, Flor plans to continue with her business and to open a restaurant in her house in the future. This will be her 15th loan through MFP. She is hoping for a small loan so that she can meet her objectives. Meanwhile, she comments that she feels pleased with her communal bank because she considers it to be a united and supportive group.\r\n\r\nFlor will invest the requested 2,000 nuevos soles in the purchase of necessary ingredients for preparing her dishes, such as rice, oil, and other ingredients.

I happen to be the only one in my family fortunate enough to attend university \u2013 the others' dreams for the same were never realized due to financial constraints that terminated their education as early as primary school. \r\n\r\nI am currently a second year student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Information Technology degree. The courses revolve around computers and I depend entirely on the university computer labs to do the IT projects. The projects are really demanding and require constant contact with computers, even during the weekends when it is not possible to utilize the labs as other classes are also held there.\r\n\r\nMy efforts to solicit funds to purchase a laptop have been rendered futile; thus, I have decided to apply for a loan. The laptop will go a long way in assisting my studies, as notes will always be available and I will be able to complete projects on time. My laptop will also be available to church youths for educational movies during the long holidays. It will enable me to leave nothing pending in my academic life and ensure I graduate in the stipulated time. After graduation, I will venture into teaching to disseminate the knowledge and life skills I have gained in life, after which I will pursue a Master's. I would also like very much to be involved in community welfare programs to put a smile in children's lives which might be denied by financial constraints. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop which will help him with his projects.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":218,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45999.96,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":15333.32,"processed_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15831.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270330045,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-07T08:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3097.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294459726,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301513667,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308499089,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315708513,"comment":null},{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":3266.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323275447,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":7666.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7915.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331459301,"comment":null},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-05T08:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339632048,"comment":null},{"amount":17.49,"local_amount":1399.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347359975,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T17:58:01Z","paid_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392421,"name":"Justus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justus is a student applying for a loan to complete an undergraduate degree at Strathmore University and this is his story:\r\n\r\nI am Justus. I am the first born in a family of seven children, four of whom are in high school and two in primary school. I am currently in the third year of my studies, pursuing a degree course in Hospitality Management at Strathmore University. I have faced a lot of difficulties paying my school fees since I joined Strathmore in 2009. I come from a humble background as my parents are not in any formal employment. My dad is a local welder and my mother is a peasant farmer. I have always depended on donors and well-wishers to pay for my school fees and even to pay for my younger brothers in high school. \r\n\r\nI am a bright student who has always maintained a top position in class. I have a lot of dreams and aspirations to help other bright but needy students access quality education and be the persons they want to be in the future. It is in this regard that I am kindly applying for this loan so as to enable me to complete my degree studies. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to thank the Kiva organization for this initiative, which I count as a blessing; more so at this time when I had almost lost hope in my education due to my financial constraints. Strathmore University has always been, and will forever be, the best educational institution due to the codes of conduct that it instills in its students. The institution enables people to develop virtues and be responsible members of society once they leave campus. \r\n\r\nIn particular, studying at Strathmore has enabled me to acquire the moral virtues required of an honest and responsible citizen. This has been made possible through the units that are taught: for example, Principles of Ethics, Theology, Social and Political Philosophy, and Philosophical Anthropology among others. The dress code has also enabled me to act and carry myself in a professional manner at all times. All these qualities and culture are very rare in most public and private universities in Kenya.\r\n\r\nAfter my graduation, I aspire to come up with a small business entrepreneurship, probably in the hotel industry, or get some employment which will not only enable me to pay back my loan, but will also give me an opportunity to help bright and needy students access higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2896.6,"image":{"id":1006213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Chumagul originally comes from the countryside. She raises the livestock. Her husband works in Russia; therefore, Chumagul and her son take care of the business.  Besides raising the livestock, Chumagul sews mattresses. However, she did not have much work because of the cold winter.

","en":"Ayub has been a client in the organization for nine years. He has three sons, one of whom is currently working in Russia. Ayub managed to expand the family business over the years. Despite his age Ayub still buys the livestock, but it is his son who raises the animals. Every morning Ayub's son takes the cows out to pasture, and in the evening he brings the animals back to the pen and gives them hay and feed. Ayub was interested in livestock fattening from an early age, and that's what he taught his sons. \r\nAyub has nine grandchildren, and he is a lively grandfather. His wife is a homemaker. Together with her daughters-in-law, she produces goat yarn and sends it over to Russia for her son to sell since it is in high demand there.  Ayub would like to take another loan to buy a couple of dairy cows while the market prices for the animals are low.

When cattle prices rise, he sells the animals and makes the profit. Abdukayum's brothers told him that it is possible to receive a loan to buy the cattle, so he decided to try to get a loan to expand his business. Abdukayum is planning on buying three young bulls.

The group's members mainly work in farming and livestock raising.  Two years ago they decided to come together so that they could access loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir.  They have used these loans to improve their financial situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sonia.  She is 40 years old, married, and has three children who are 16, 13 and 4 years old.  Her two oldest children are in high school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nSonia and her husband both farm.  During the winter season they grow corn, peanuts and certain vegetables.  They also grow passion fruit year round as these are  long-cycle crops.  Right now they are focusing on their corn and peanut crops as they require the most protection from pests.  They have requested this loan to buy insecticides and fertilizers so that they can enjoy a better production.  They work from Monday to Friday, from 7.00am to 3.00pm.  In the summer they focus more on producing passion fruit which they pick and then deliver to different markets in the city.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fertilizers and insecticides.  Sonia has been a member of her community bank from the beginning and she likes it because of the help that they have given her to make progress through loans.\r\n\r\nSonia's dream is to enjoy a very good production and, above all, good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1004275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala west region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past five years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small business, which involves stone quarrying. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to hire workers and buy some materials to use in her stone quarrying business. This will help Florence generate greater profits and enable her to buy food for her family. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her improve her business.

is Jacinta, 50, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Celestino, a steel man, and is a mother to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nJacinta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJacinta hopes her business grows more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

They have four children:  a 24-year-old, 15-year-old twins, and the youngest is 8 years old.  Dora and her family live in their own home in the town of Kimiri in the District of Chanchamayo.  She works in coordination on her farm.  Dora grows coffee and bananas on two plots of land located several minutes away from town.  With the help of her husband and oldest son, she is able to optimize the care she provides to her crops.  Everything depends on how they manage their time.\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband also provides transportation services using his own automobile.  His route stretches from La Merced to Puente Paucartambo.  He travels Monday through Saturdays.  In this manner, he is able to provide financial income to support their four children, especially the twins and the 8-year-old since they are of school age.  \r\n<p>\r\nDora wants to expand her production of coffee, so she will replace some of the plants that have withered with ones that will generate beans.  This will be her first time to access a loan from MFP.  For this reason, she takes responsibility of her monthly payments.  Dora is part of the Communal Bank \"Virgen del Carmen\" and is pleased that she shares the same interests with her fellow members.  Upon receipt of the money, she will invest in the purchase of 3000 coffee seedlings so that she can replace her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1003739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 3,000 coffee plants.

They are both farmers.  They raise agricultural products on land he inherited from his father in the community of Chullpani Chico.  In this way, they support their children and send them to get a good education.  Gumercindo at the moment is not working because he needs money to buy new tires for his truck.  This is why they have come to our offices of Cidre to ask for a loan.  He tells us that sometimes the savings that he has is not enough to support the household expenses.  Other financial institutions would not lend him money because of his age.\r\nFinally Gumercindo and his wife feel happy.  They will buy the tires and they will begin to travel as soon as possible.  Their dream is to have their children be professionals and have a better future than what they have had.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1005199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

The group is called \"La Medalla Milagrosa\" (the miraculous medal) and consists of eight members, each interested in developing her business. The group was created eight years ago.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Norma, aged 57, is married and the mother of four adult children. She has a grocery store, which has been her sole source of income for over eight years. She began this activity as a result of the lack of a grocery in her neighborhood. In the course of time she expanded her store and made it better known, and she is very grateful to her neighbors who supported her over all these years. With the income from her grocery she could install her home and enjoy more comfort, and in the future she would like to see her grocery expanding much more. Norma will use this loan to buy polo shirts for schools.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5725,"image":{"id":1005173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

They live in the town of Soledad and this is where Harold sells food products and groceries.  He buys these products to supply stores and small businesses who mainly sell to housewives.  Harold started this business three years ago when he started selling toiletries.  His business gradually started to grow and he has now added household essentials such as rice, oil, cold cuts, canned food, etc. to his sales.  Harold sells on a short-term credit system.  He delivers his merchandise to his customers and collects payment the next day.  He makes his purchases for cash every day in grocery stores in the city of Barranquilla, which is 20 minutes from his town.  Each time his customer base grows, he realizes that his working capital is not enough to respond to his demand in a timely manner.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will use his loan to buy food products and groceries in larger quantities.  This means he will be able to make the most of bulk discounts and make more profits.

Yuriy grew up in the village and knows what a farm is since his childhood. He has been in the farming business for ten years now \u2013 he grows vegetables in the greenhouses. At this time he has four greenhouses for vegetables and two for seedlings.

His good organization and dedication to his work helped him to later rent a place while he was establishing himself with his customers. \r\n\r\nHe gradually managed to grow and buy equipment and tools.  With this growth came new customers, and it necessitated the support of his wife and two employees who currently work for him.\r\n\r\nHe is now applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy ingredients like butter, salsas, and other supplies in greater amounts in order to get discounts.  He will be especially preparing for the season,  \u201cLos Carnavales\u201d,  when his business sells a lot more.\r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to have his own house.  That is why every day he works enthusiastically; he wants to achieve this goal and create greater well-being for his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1005247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

She enjoys ironing their clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is Yanna's sixth loan with Esperanza. She started her business with the first loan she received from Esperanza International, around three years ago. She plans to use this loan to purchase a glass cabinet and different pairs of shoes. This cabinet will be used to show her products. \r\n\r\nYanna wants to reinvest the profits from her business and to save because her future plan is to improve her family's living conditions, have enough money to provide a good education for her children, and send them to university. She hopes to be able to save enough money to continue improving her family's lives and to make one of her dreams come true, her dream of having a successful business. She thanks you for your support!
