This doesn\u2019t discourage her and she continues to work, having plans to follow in the future of her business.  This will be her 5th loan through MFP and appreciates the cooperation toward reaching her goals.  She promises to be on time with her payments as she was with her previous loans.  On the other hand she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she considers the members to be united.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan of 2,000 PEN to buy a dough maker, brought from the capital city, which she will use to make her candy.

She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and has three children.  Her husband moved to the Russian Federation because he didn't have steady employment in his motherland.  Since her husband left, Munira has been the primary breadwinner for the family.  Several years ago, she studied in a dressmaking course and she has experience in sewing women's clothing.  Her work habits and experience gave her an opportunity to earn money by teaching a dressmaking course.  She has been doing this for three months already and she wants to open her own sewing shop where she will both serve customers and teach several students.\r\n\r\nMunira needs a sewing machine in order to open her shop, but she doesn't have the financial resources to buy one.  Her husband refused to send her the money, so she is requesting a loan of 1,500 somoni (TJS) to buy a sewing machine.  She anticipates your kindness and she is relying only on you.  This loan will help her to open her own business, giving her a source of income that will bring stability into her

the modern world. She is married to a good man by the name of Assadullo. They do not yet have children, but dream of having beautiful babies. Salomat and her husband live together with his parents. Assadullo's parents are pensioners, while he earns only a small salary, which is insufficient to provide the family with all necessities of life. Salomat has decided to help her husband for the good of the family, and to this end took the course \"Succeed\" organized by the Association of Business Women and earned her graduation certificate. Now she is quite ready to launch her own business and achieve success.\r\n\r\nSalomat would like to start her business of buying and selling cattle, as she has experience in this line of work.

","en":"When Abdullobeg was a child and played with his friends, he always wanted to play the role of the teacher.  When he grew up, his childhood dream came true.  He is a teacher of history and law.  He is 55 years old, married, and has five children.  His wife is retired and receives a small pension that isn't enough to pay for even her own needs.  The children are adults and help him provide for their family.  They put their money together and use it to buy food, clothing, and to pay for education.  Abdullobeg works in a high school and he loves his profession, but his salary isn't large enough for him to put any money into savings.\r\n\r\nSoon, one of his daughters is going to get married.  Abdullobeg has to pay the dowry and throw a wedding party, which in the Tajik tradition is called a \"domodtalabon.\"  This is a party that is held at home or in a restaurant with friends and family participating.  The table is lavishly set and there is a singer.  At this interesting ceremony, the bride gets bedecked with traditional adornments.  \r\n\r\nAbdullobeg is requesting a loan of 3,000 somoni (TJS) to hold the wedding party.  He is relying on your kindness.  This loan will help him make his daughter happy.  As the conscientious man he is, he promises to repay the loan in a timely fashion."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1261602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal

","en":"Huseyn is a very hard-working and purposeful person. Since childhood, he has laboured for his family's well-being, as they lived in difficult conditions. While his classmates played outside after school, Huseyn worked as an assistant in a cafe-bakery. When he grew a little older, he learned home repair from a professional and began working as a repairman himself. However, the family's expenses grew, and Huseyn was forced to travel to Russia to find work. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Huseyn is 34 years old, married, and has 3 wonderful children in his care. Huseyn's wife is engaged part-time in selling children's clothing, while he works in a bakery after being unable to find good work abroad. The children are too young to work and currently attend school. Huseyn is a very caring father and spends all his money on his children's well-being.\r\n\r\nHuseyn owns a car, which is an absolute necessity for his family. The car recently began to malfunction, but Huseyn lacks the money for its repairs. Additionally, he needs to carry out small repairs in his home. Therefore, Huseyn is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to repair his car and his house. He is a return client of IMON International and has a good credit history. He needs and counts on your

After graduating from the university in 2000, Aizada began working in animal husbandry to give her family a source of income.   She started her business with 6,000 som (KGS) and it now brings in about 4,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and cattle.   Today, she has one cow and its calf and five sheep.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to increasing the number of cattle she has, she applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and young sheep.  Aizada plans to invest the profits from the loan in increasing the size of her herd, which will expand her business.  After all, one day she will have to get her children established in life and she wants to get started now so it will be easier

She started her livestock business 30 years ago with a sum of 1,000 som (KGS). Today, she earns around 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy products and resale of livestock. In order to further increase the size of her herd, Jamalkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves and young sheep. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her herd, and also intends to improve the animal's living conditions in the near

Ainur's husband works as head of a museum. In search of a source of income for her family, Ainur started her business of livestock breeding already in 1991, with a starting sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Successfully working in the areas of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation has given good results. Ainur also grows fodder crops, which she uses to provide fodder for her livestock and gets additional income from selling fodder. Besides fodder, Ainur grows potatoes on her plot of land. Every month, the family gets up to 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Ainur turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of cows with calves and young sheep. Ainur plans to use the income from the loan in developing her farm. Ainur told us that in the future she plans to build a house at the neighboring plot and improve the conditions of the livestock, building a new, large shed."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1372.22,"image":{"id":1261723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase cows with calves and young sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Mazar Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T10:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T10:20:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainur","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":422.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":422.22},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":422.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.11,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012513,"comment":null},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-02T09:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":15015.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372863019,"comment":null},{"amount":422.22,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":20021.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743672,"comment":null},{"amount":422.22,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20021.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T17:59:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":510793,"name":"Rakhima","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0414\u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0420\u0443\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0439 33 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u0420\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0443.","en":"Rakhima lives in the region of J-Rumy.

is 29 years old, married, and has four children, three of whom attend school.  She lives in the town of Arua hill in the Arua region of Uganda. For the past three years, Jeniva has been working hard to manage her hair salon.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jeniva is requesting a loan from BRAC Uganda for 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings, which she will use to buy more hair products, such as weaves for styling.  The loan will help Jeniva to generate greater profits and improve her family standard of living. Jeniva hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business into a hair vocational training center. \r\n\r\nJeniva is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

It is a group of five women and three men led by Erasto, who is pictured on the right with his hand raised. He is receiving an input loan for half an acre's worth of maize and sorghum to cultivate. The 2013 \"long rains\" season (March\/April to May\/June) will be Erasto\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer delivered reliably at the best prices, so that he can grow enough food for the family.\r\n\r\nLast year, Erasto harvested three bags of maize on one acre of land. He is excited that he will improve his harvest as a One Acre Fund farmer. He plans to spend the money that he earns from his next harvest on sending his children to school, repairing his home, buying livestock, saving for the future and perhaps investing in another business. During the 2013 long rains season, each group member will receive half an acre of agricultural inputs on credit, meaning that Erasto\u2019s group will receive four acres worth in total.\r\n\r\n(One of the group members, Catherine, dropped out of the program after the Kiva photo was taken.

This is primarily because they have a serious problem with their home's windows and doors.

temperamento alegre y cordial, la hacen merecedora de una gran popularidad en el barrio y ella la aprovecha para fortalecer sus negocios mediante los cuales se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de almuerzo y comidas, adem\u00e1s y de vender cervezas y gaseosas en un punto frio,  que es muy concurrido. Su primera iniciativa comercial data de hace 8 a\u00f1os, cuando trabaj\u00f3 en un restaurante del centro de la ciudad y su propietaria se enferm\u00f3,  debiendo cerrarlo. Esto    gener\u00f3  a Onix, la necesidad de trabajar independientemente y estar mas cerca del cuidado de su hija, as\u00ed fue como en su propia casa, empez\u00f3 vendiendo almuerzos y poco a poco hizo crecer su negocio, aport\u00e1ndole su mayor dinamismo y disciplina de trabajo. Cuando inici\u00f3 lo hizo en la \u00e9poca de carnaval y esto fue una oportunidad para medir sus ventas y estimular sus deseos de hacerlo crecer y sacar adelante a su hija, como lo logr\u00f3 pues estudia enfermer\u00eda y muy pronto la terminar\u00e1. En la actualidad sus ventas se han incrementado y su demanda crece cada vez mas, por eso tener un capital de trabajo, para invertir y satisfacer a su clientela, se convierte en todo un desaf\u00edo. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un cedikiva,  primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas, har\u00e1 mejoramiento del local, para tener un espacio mejor organizado, que despierte a su clientela, el deseo de regresar a su negocio a consumir los productos que ofrece. Su mayor sue\u00f1o de prosperidad es lograr que su hija termine su carrera profesional y que tenga un futuro lleno de muchos \u00e9xitos. ","en":"Onix is 50 and lives with her 26-year-old daughter is one of the most traditional areas of Barranquilla, a pleasant and welcoming city. She is very popular in her neighborhood, and she takes advantage of this to grow her business selling prepared foods and cold beer and sodas. She started her business eight years ago when the owner of the restaurant where she worked became ill and closed the business. Onix, therefore, had to work on her own and needed to care for her daughter. She began to sell lunches from her house and slowly grew the business by putting her energy and effort behind it. \r\n\r\nShe began the business during carnival season, which gave her a chance to gauge sales and instilled in her the desire to grow it to support her daughter, who will soon finish her nursing courses. Her sales and demand continue to grow, and having capital to invest and satisfy her customers is a challenge. This is why she approached Kiva for a loan, her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use the loan to buy commodities and renovate and reorganize her space. She hopes this will inspire customers to come back to enjoy the food she serves. Her great dream is that her daughter finishes her studies and enjoys a successful future.

is 30 years old and lives in the town of Mbarara in the Mbarara region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, two of them are currently in school. For the past 6 years, Pamellah has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar, salt, apples and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Pamellah has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to increase essential commodities such as milk, apples, cooking oil, sugar and salt to attract more customers, and will help Pamellah to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Pamellah hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another wholesale business. \r\n\r\nPamellah is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs, like Pamellah, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1260743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Below is the story of Rose's group.  Rose is the one whose hand is raised.<p>\r\n\r\nRose is a 35-year-old, married woman with eight children. Six of her children are in school. To earn a living, she operates a retail shop, where she sells pork in the outskirts of Kagadi town. Her major clients are residents of Kisenyi, a suburb of Kagadi where she operates. She explains that she started the business in 1993 in an effort to increase income for her family. Rose's major challenge is insufficient capital, which makes it difficult to meet her clients' demands for pork products.<p>\r\n\r\nRose is seeking a loan in the amount of 400,000 UGX. With the loan proceeds, she plans to purchase additional piglets so that she increase her family's earnings. Her dream is to construct a permanent residential house for the family and to make sure that her children are educated at a higher institution of learning. She is thankful that UGAFODE came at the time that her group members needed financial services; indeed, she feels that UGAFODE's appearance in their lives answered their prayers. The group collectively believes that they will make good use of the money this Christmas and that the returns will be signficant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1260793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Typical dress and the native language are still very common. The women chose this group name because where they live used to be a ranch called \"Rancher\u00eda\". \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda, who is the group's representative, is 35 years old. She has been married for 14 years to Alejandro, who works in construction. They have three school-aged children. Do\u00f1a Yolanda, for the last 20 years, has made a living raising sheep. She owns eight sheep and with this loan, she plans to buy four more, as well as feed for them. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Yolanda mentions that \"I began raising sheep because as a young girl, I learned from my mother how to take care of them and raise them. I saw that this was a good way to make money.\" Do\u00f1a Yolanda is a very warm and happy person because thanks to her earnings from this work, she has been able to help improve her family's quality of life. The only obstacle she's faced so far has been disease among the animals, which sometimes kills her sheep, causing her to lose income.

He lives with Mar\u00eda, who is a merchant and the mother of their two children who are 14 and 6 years old. He loves them very much. They live together in their own home, along with his mother. Walter sells spare parts and services vehicles, so he has a multi-service shop located in a building that he rents. Here, he attends to the requests of his customers, who count on him to repair their vehicles. He provides good service and the new parts that they need.\r\n\r\nHe began over 10 years ago with his own capital by buying and selling in small quantities. Then, he would increase his stock of merchandise from his earnings. Currently, he also counts on help from his partner in the shop. He considers his business to be pretty successful due to the income he makes and the demand for his products. His shop is located in a busy, commercial area.\r\n\r\nDeciding to start a business was one of Walter's goals in life. This economic activity was a venture of his partner's, who he encouraged to increase income and not overlook necessities.

is a Lebanese single man. He\u2019s 21 years old. He\u2019s really attached to his parents and two siblings who are both working. Cooperating together, Hussein and his family are capable of covering their heavy expenses in order to live a respectable life. He started his business at an early age. He had to work really hard to take some responsibilities off his father. He has been working as a car mechanic in his own garage and has gained a fair number of customers asking for his services.

She lives with Gabriel, who is a truck driver, and the father of her daughter, who is now independent. They live comfortably together in their own house. Margarita sells soft drinks, for which she has a freezer in her own home, where she can keep her product at a temperature that her customers like. They buy from her every day. She has been working in this business for more than ten years. When her daughter visits, she has her help to sell the product to the customers. \r\nWhat she likes about her job is the income that she makes, and that she can support her family with some earnings. She also likes the free time that she has and can use for other activities. On the other hand, what she doesn't like is that some customers, already being drunk, become somewhat disrespectful. She says that in this business, one can't lose, because it's a highly-consumed product. It is in demand at every social activity. This is why she has plans to expand her both her business and the place where she serves her customers. This will be her third loan from MFP. Margarita is grateful for the loan to continue with her business. She wants to continue receiving more loans. This is why she is committed to making her payments on time. \r\nShe also feels very content in her communal bank, because she considers the members to be supportive and committed to their responsibilities. With the amount she applied for, 1200 nuevos soles, she will invest in purchasing merchandise like soft drinks of various flavors and brands, looking for low prices for the volume of her purchases. This way, she hopes to increase her profit margin.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1261986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft drinks of different flavors and brands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-21T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-20T19:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":189.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":202.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":211.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":217.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.23},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.18,"local_amount":179.82,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573094,"comment":null},{"amount":74.92,"local_amount":189.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":192.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122736,"comment":null},{"amount":78.83,"local_amount":199.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577393,"comment":null},{"amount":80.23,"local_amount":202.68,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":205.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529630,"comment":null},{"amount":169.84,"local_amount":429.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":435.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975925,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-22T05:20:37Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":510214,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter used his previous loan of 30,000 KES to boost his building supply business and this increased his monthly income from 64,000 KES to 80,000 KES.

Several times, he has requested loans from local financial institutions for his trading business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly salary earned by Gela working as a miner. As well, Gela\u2019s wife gets a relevant pension from the local government as she is a mother of many children. The income is enough only for food for the six member family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Gela and his wife requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Gela will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them in his district for a profit.

Before she started her business, Yudy lived for a year in the United States. With her hard work, she was able to save and she began to sell merchandise from that country. When she returned to Colombia, she continued this activity because she had a large number of customers in Sincelejo, a city also located on the Caribbean coast. Little by little, she went strengthening her business and today she has been able to maintain it and generate more income with which she contributes to the wellbeing of her home.

is 32 years old and lives in the town of Lyantonde in the Mbarara region of Uganda.

The loan will be used to buy more fresh fish for reselling, and will help Rose to generate greater profits to pay school fees and cover her family's basic needs. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to own the biggest fish selling market. \r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly amount earned by Manana\u2019s son, who has a horse and serves local farmers in land cultivation and transportation. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provisions for business start-ups and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Manana will purchase clothes and bedding at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit. It will be hard work for Manana, but according to her estimates, her business will be profitable and will increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in her clothing trading business to increase her stock and sales volume.

The loan will be used to buy more seeds such as beans and maize for planting and cattle feed which will help the cattle produce enough milk. This will help Yawasi generate greater profits and pay school fees and medical bills for his children. Yawasi hopes that in the future he will be able to expand his business on a large scale. \r\n\r\nYawasi is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

The demand for fish in the region is very high as it is consumed by most of the people. She makes dried fish by keeping the fish in sunlight until all the water in it evaporates and preserves them for future use (like when fish are not available in the market, in the rainy season). Dried fish is also used as a supplement to fresh fish. \r\n\r\nMinati is requesting a loan to buy a cool storage box for keeping fish, fishing net and insecticides to prevent fish from decaying for her fishery business.

Con quien tiene 3 hijos ya adultos. Mar\u00eda se educ\u00f3 con sus padres que aunque de escasos recursos, le pudieron al menos regalar parte de su educaci\u00f3n y tambi\u00e9n le ense\u00f1aron todo sobre la agricultura, con la cual Mar\u00eda podr\u00eda obtener el sustento. Ahora Mar\u00eda vive con su c\u00f3nyuge en la ciudad de El Puyo, cant\u00f3n capital de la Provincia de Pastaza, una provincia que forma parte importante de la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica del Ecuador, siendo el centro de la selva amaz\u00f3nica. En su capital Puyo se puede gozar de un agradable clima y un paisaje esplendoroso con r\u00edos, cascadas diversidad de fauna y flora por lo que turistas nacionales y extranjeros llegan a deleitarse de estos c\u00e1lidos atractivos. Por ser el turismo una de las actividades econ\u00f3micas m\u00e1s importantes, en el centro de la ciudad se encuentra f\u00e1cilmente todos los servicios para acoger al turista como son hoteles, hoster\u00edas, restaurantes, instituciones financieras, etc. Tambi\u00e9n los habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y ganader\u00eda que son favorecidas con la tierra f\u00e9rtil que posee este lugar. Sin duda El Puyo es una ciudad que vale la pena visitar ya que ha crecido mucho en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os por el esp\u00edritu emprendedor y trabajador de su gente. \nAl ser la agricultura una actividad importante en la zona, Mar\u00eda se ha dedicado a trabajar en este negocio desde hace 5 a\u00f1os. Dedica los fines de semana 10 horas a la venta de yuca, pl\u00e1tano y ca\u00f1a y aunque los otros d\u00edas tambi\u00e9n realiza ciertos tipos de cuidado a los sembr\u00edos, ella paralelamente a la agricultura atiende una tienda de v\u00edveres de cuyos ingresos tiene el sustento para todos los d\u00edas. Ahora Mar\u00eda quiere que esta tienda est\u00e9 m\u00e1s surtida ya que con la experiencia que ha ido adquiriendo sabe los productos que son m\u00e1s demandados por sus clientes y con los cuales a veces no cuenta en stock. Por esta raz\u00f3n Mar\u00eda necesita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar mercader\u00eda al por mayor para ofrecer variedad de productos en su tienda y con esto obtener mayores ingresos que le ayuden a sustentar los gastos legales para formalizar los documentos que avalan la propiedad de los terrenos en donde ella trabaja. Mar\u00eda es una mujer emprendedora y trabajadora que no se ha visto limitada por ning\u00fan obst\u00e1culo y es por esto que agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa por la ayuda y la confianza que le han brindado. ","en":"Mar\u00eda is a 49 year old woman. She studied at primary school and she is married to Hugo who is 56 years old with whom she has three grown children. Mar\u00eda was brought up by her parents, and although they had scarce resources, at least they gave her some education and they also taught her about agriculture so that Mar\u00eda could obtain a living.\r\n\r\nNow Mar\u00eda lives with her husband in the city of El Puyo, the capital of the canton of Pastaza Province, a province that is an important part of the Amazon region of Ecuador, in the center of the Amazon jungle.\r\n\r\nIn the capital of Puyo one can enjoy a pleasant climate and a splendid landscape with rivers, waterfalls, and a variety of flora and fauna which nationals and foreign tourists visit to enjoy themselves at these warm attractions.\r\n\r\nSince tourism is one of the most important economic activities, in the city center can easily be found all the tourist services such as hotels, hostels, restaurants, banks, etc. Also, the local people work in agriculture and livestock that are favored because of the fertile land that this place has. Puyo is a city worth visiting as it has grown a lot in the last years through the entrepreneurial spirit and hard work of its people.\r\n\r\nSince agriculture is an important activity in the area, Mar\u00eda has been doing this work for 5 years. She works 10 hours on the weekends selling cassava, bananas and sugarcane and although the other days she also takes particular steps caring for her crops, at the same time she attends to a grocery store whose income takes care of everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNow Mar\u00eda wants to supply this store as through the experience that she has acquired she knows the products that are the most demanded by her clients and which she sometimes does not have in stock. This is why Mar\u00eda needs a loan to buy merchandise at wholesale in order to offer a variety of products in her store and thus obtain better income to help her cover the legal expenses to execute the documents to endorse the ownership of the land where she works.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is an enterprising and hardworking woman who has not been overcome by any obstacle and this is why she is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternative for the help and trust that they have given.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1262102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

She and her husband strive each day to provide the necessary things for their children, focusing on good nutrition and health as well as education.\r\n\r\nIrma is a talented seamstress. She sews aprons and embroiders blouses. Her current goal is to buy a variety of fabrics to fill orders for aprons that she has received. Irma is anxious to secure another micro-loan from Friendship Bridge so that she can meet the increased demand that comes at this time of the year. She is on her 5th loan cycle. Irma points out that micro-loans are a great way to move ahead, especially in small rural communities of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nIrma, along with the ten women of \"Azul,\" wish to express their gratitude to all KIVA investors, who they feel bonded with because of these loans.

She is married and has 4 children aged 21, 19, 8 and 4 years old.  In 2008, Tity established a charcoal business. She began her business because she wants to assist her husband in taking care of the home. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about SLL1,800,000 every month from this business.

The members of Ann Thakurani Self Help Group are all women from the district of Khurda in Odisha, India. One of them is Mrs. Lili, who was selected as their president. The lady standing in the middle wearing a cream-colored sari with a red floral print in the photo is Lili. Lili is 32 years old and is staying with her husband and her four children. Her husband is a farmer and has been involved in cultivation for a long time. She got the idea of doing vegetable cultivation from her husband, so she gathered some other women from her neighborhood and told them about her plan. They liked her idea and appreciated her. She took on leadership of the group and started to cultivate vegetables and sell them in her village.
