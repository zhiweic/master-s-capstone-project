He is single and lives together with his parents and siblings in the city of Chincha.  In spite of his young age, he is a very friendly, hard-working and enthusiastic person who has great aspirations and a great desire to support his family.  Unfortunately, owing to his need to work and support his parents with the household expenses, Branco was not able to study for a degree.  However, he still dreams of studying for a degree in industrial engineering.  In his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his brothers and friends and he sometimes cooks a delicious 'carapulcra con sopa seca' to share with his family.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of commitment and enthusiasm, and thanks to his parents' support, Branco works daily as a salesman in a candy company in his city.  He works approximately ten hours a day and feels happy in his work as his bosses value him because of his good work and friendly treatment of others.\r\n\r\nBranco is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to build a room out the back of his parents' home.  This will give him a bedroom of his own.  Because he has a number of siblings, in the past they have always shared the same bedroom.  He would like to provide his family with a little more security, well-being and comfort and in the not-so-distant future he hopes to completely finish building work on his parents' home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1141044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

It was built in the early 1990\u2019s with uninsulated brick walls. In winter, his house becomes very cold and his children always get sick due to the cold. Because his house has a heat-loss problem, it costs him a lot to buy coal fuel every winter. In Mongolia winter is severe and freezing cold. Most of the households in the ger districts use coal and other kind of toxic fuels such as used tires, shoes, etc. As you know it is extremely harmful to peoples' health, the environment, and the air around the cities. As a result, Dorjpalam decided to put insulation in the walls of his house before this coming winter. Recently, the Mongolian government and many other people, institutions, and enterprises have been caring and starting some projects to decrease air pollution in the cities. The loan he is requesting will be used to buy bricks and foam to put insulation in the walls of his house. In addition, his co-workers and friends will support him in this project.

She lives with her family members in a one room house located in the Villa Tunari zone of the city of El Alto. \r\n\r\nShe currently makes an income as she works more than eight hours a day weaving blankets. She also has a bookstore as a second source of income. Her income is not enough, which is why she is requesting a loan to increase and vary the merchandise in her bookstore. Weaving blankets is very hard and creates debt for her because it does not cover food costs, education, and the payment of basic services for her family. \r\n\r\nLidia's dream is to improve her income to be able to become independent and improve her quality of life. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan she has requested from IMPRO and the first loan through Kiva.

She lives in the city of Ica with her young 9 year old son. Unfortunately, for various reasons she has been separated from her husband for many years. She has to act as both mother and father to her little one. She is friendly, hardworking, and enthusiastic. She dedicates all her efforts to getting herself and her son ahead in life. Thanks to the support of her parents, who have always been at her side, Fanny was able to study the professional career of nursing. Unfortunately, due to the need to work and pay her bills, she has not been able to use her profession. She would like to be able to work as a nurse. In her free time, she likes to dedicate some of her time to reading. Sometimes she cooks up a delicious Aj\u00ed de Gallina [shredded chicken with peppers and sauce] to share with her family. \r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work, and thanks to the support of her family, Fanny works day after day, starting early in the morning as a ticket seller at a transportation company in her city. She works about 12 hours a day, and can attend to about 75 customers. She enjoys the work and her bosses regard her highly because of her diligence and friendly treatment. \r\n\r\nFanny is thankful for the Kiva loans.

This way Fanny will be able to keep her home in better condition, and thus be able to provide better security and well being for her young son. Little by little in the near future, she hopes to have her own business that she can use to assure the future and the education of her little one.

She is a happy woman eager to succeed. Her partner is Tedy, who works in construction. He is the father of her two children, Elizabeth who is 16 years old and Marcos who is 14 years old. They live together in the house they built on land that was inherited from her mother.\r\n\r\nHer activity is making clothing and lingerie. She learned this profession by watching her youngest daughter when she had school work. Later she decided to study and to buy a sewing machine with her savings. Six months ago she set up at home and since then she is looked for because of the quality finish of her work. Also, she provides home service of cosmetology, pedicures, manicures, and hair dyes.\r\n\r\nShe likes the sewing business because she enjoys it and she can help her partner pay the household expenses.

Lessons from her grandmother and mother led to the opening of her start-up restaurant, \"Soul Heaven Caf\u00e9\". After conducting customer research, Lillie leased a building in her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, that\u2019s surrounded by multiple businesses where soul food has little competition other than a couple of nearby fast food restaurants.\r\n\r\nBesides her knowledge of cooking from scratch from her family, Lillie worked for a major Italian chain restaurant that sent her to culinary school. She also managed multiple restaurants. She says corporate always wants what\u2019s best for it rather than the customer. \u201cWhat I have learned from managing other businesses is you have to jump through hoops. It\u2019s not about the customer, it\u2019s about the dollar,\u201d she says. Lillie plans to do just the opposite with her restaurant. She is starting out small to ensure she can properly cater to customers\u2019 needs. When she opens in the middle of July, her restaurant will be the only one in her area offering made-from-scratch breakfast before 11 a.m.\r\n\r\nSince her business is a start-up, Lillie is the only employee. The restaurant is modeled after a take-out establishment, but can comfortably sit 15 hungry customers. She says Soul Heaven Caf\u00e9 will create four new jobs when it kicks off, but, for the time being, she\u2019ll receive help from family when needed. Lillie\u2019s menu will consist of a variety of dishes, including chef salad, chicken salad, grilled or fried chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches, vegetables, fruits, wings, and homemade cakes and puddings. She will also offer daily specials and party platters. \r\n\r\nTo get started, Lillie needed more kitchen equipment. But knowing she might not qualify for a loan, she purchased cooking equipment progressively until she inquired about a loan. Lillie says she did a quick Google search for loans in her area and came across Accion Texas Inc. However, she didn\u2019t follow through with an application until the Alabama Women in Business organization encouraged her. The Accion loan will help her business flourish, as she is able to purchase equipment and offer more menu choices, she says. Without the loan, it would have taken Lillie longer to open. \u201cI would like to thank Accion for believing in my dreams and helping me achieve my dreams.\u201d She is currently in the process of obtaining the domain name for her future website, but has a Facebook page for now: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Soul-Heaven-Cafe\/203786046407460.

is Trinidad, a 48-year-old resident of Manila, Philippines, is married to Julio, a vendor, and a mother to her children. She and her husband and children manage their household while operating their businesses. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nTrinidad operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not just a family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Trinidad is requesting a Php 10,000 loan to buy more quantities of meats, rice, vegetables, condiments,  seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nTrinidad dreams of growing her business and being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work. She also hopes to have her own restaurant someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.<p>\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

El trabajo es independiente y en la investigaci\u00f3n que realizo le pareci\u00f3 rentable, empez\u00f3 vendiendo bajo el c\u00f3digo de otra persona pero esto no le ayudaba ya que quien ganaba las promociones por vol\u00famenes de venta era su amiga. Cuando pudo reunir dinero para capitalizarse se acerco a la empresa y se registro con su propio c\u00f3digo. El trabajo lo realiza sola haciendo recorridos y visitando a sus clientes ya sea para cobrar o entregar y recoger pedidos. Su horario normalmente es desde las 9:00 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 11:00 y luego sale a las 15:00 hasta las 17:00 realiza este intervalo porque regresa a casa para atender a sus hijos.

She chose this work because she wanted to help her husband with expenses and, as she has two small children to care for, she was not able to work for a business. She could work independently in this area and, in the investigation she conducted, it seemed to her that it was profitable. She began selling under another person\u2019s account, but this did not help because it was her friend who won the sales promotions based on sales volumes and not her. When she was able to accumulate enough money to capitalize her own business, she went to the company and was registered with her own account. \r\n\r\nShe works alone, traveling to visit her clients either to collect money or to take and deliver orders. Her schedule is normally from 9 in the morning until 11 a.m. and then she leaves again from 3 until 5 in the afternoons,  The interval at home allows her to take care of her children. Erika sells products such as makeup, lipsticks, etc., which she buys on a margin of 30% of sales. She lives in Las Orquideas and her husband works as a driver for a tourist agency. She will use the loan to buy products such as perfume, makeup, clothing and footwear and expects to earn more profit when she sells them. In the future she hopes to be able to have a better established business and thus help more with household income.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1142974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":" \r\nto purchase makeup, clothing and footwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2012-07-21T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-20T22:00:05Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1254.73,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":103.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":107.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":115.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.53},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":451883,"name":"Sakina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina is 56 years old.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.

She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory, and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to have her own house and that her children will have a good quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She is dedicated to making scarves for all kinds of events, flags and selling beauty products from catalogs. She started the business five years ago when her husband lost his job and she found the need to start a business and saw the opportunity to work in something that she liked and earn money. One of the advantages of her business is that in her area no one else has this business.

She is a fighter, and has raised her six children as a single mother. \r\n\r\nCleotilde has a recycling business, which she started 10 years ago after she left her job as a janitor in a public school. She chose this type of work because it allows her to take care of her children and manage her time. She says that it is cost effective and she uses mostly human material which considerably reduces her costs. In the time that she has had her business, she has been able to raise enough capital to buy several tricycles which she lends to others who do the work, as she is more of an intermediary and buys the recycling by weight and then sells it on to larger processors. \r\n\r\nCleotilde's business has grown considerably in recent years thanks to the government's campaign for a greener country. The loan she is requesting will be used to capitalize and to continue to buy recycled material from her suppliers. In the future, she hopes to buy a truck to make her business more
