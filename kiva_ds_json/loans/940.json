mayor parte de sus ventas son bajo pedidos que le hacen sus clientes con anticipaci\u00f3n, deja sus productos a cr\u00e9dito y cobra cada ocho d\u00edas.

She makes her sales door to door, working three or four days a week for about three hours each day.  The majority of her sales come from orders that her customers place in advance.  She offers her products on credit and collects her payments every eight days.  She purchases the clothing in Guayaquil since she can get it less expensive and there is more variety.  She has worked for three years doing this and it is going well.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting another loan with the organization.  The other loan that she received was a great help to her since with the earnings that she obtained she could pay her tuition and begin her studies at the university.  She would like a new loan to be able to invest in her business and thus, acquire more income to be able to achieve her goal of becoming a great professional.  This loan is to purchase all types of clothing.

Lleva cuatro ciclos en el Banco Comunal y le gusta porque los cr\u00e9ditos son r\u00e1pidos y sin tantos requisitos.\n\nElla para ganarse la vida y as\u00ed ayudar a  su hijo en sus estudios se dedica al comercio,  tiene un local en su casa en la cual vende ropa americana, zapatos, carteras, entre otros productos que le env\u00edan de los Estados Unidos, trabaja todos los d\u00edas en su negocio y tambi\u00e9n prepara comida y bocadillos para un centro de eventos sociales de la ciudad, actividad que realiza hasta dos veces por semana y con lo cual se gana una buena cantidad por la venta de estos platos, lleva  m\u00e1s de 9 a\u00f1os con su negocio y  es as\u00ed como ha logrado sacar adelante sola a su hijo para que este sea una persona de bien.\n\nElla est\u00e1 repitiendo el cr\u00e9dito el cual le fue de mucha ayuda ya que pudo pagar una mercader\u00eda que le llego en esos d\u00edas, en su negocio como siempre ha tenido d\u00edas muy buenos y otros no tanto pero este le permite salir adelante y darle a su hijo una muy buena educaci\u00f3n. Este cr\u00e9dito es para compra ropa, zapatos, carteras y v\u00edveres para preparar sus deliciosos platos.\n \nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un gran restaurante en la ciudad.\n\n\n","en":"The communal bank \"Seventh of September\" meets every two weeks in the city of Manta, a city known for its beautiful beaches, which are well visited in every season of the year, and for being a city with unequaled beauty and many tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Jenny lives in this place. She is 36 years old and is a single mother with a 19-year-old son who is studying in the university. She has been in the communal bank for four loan cycles, and she likes it because the loans are quick and don't have too many requirements.\r\n\r\nShe works in commerce in order to earn a living and thus help her son with his studies. She has a shop in her house where she sells American clothing, shoes, and purses, among other products, that they send her from the United States. She works in her business every day, and she also prepares food and appetizers for a social events center in the city, a business that she works in up to two times a week and from which she earns a good amount by selling these dishes. She has had this business for more than 9 years, and this is how she has managed to raise her son alone so that he could become a good person.\r\n\r\nShe is repeating the loan that was of so much help to her, since she was able to pay for the merchandise that arrived for her during this time. In her business, as always, she has had very good days and others that were not so good, but it has allowed her to advance and to give her son a very good education. This loan is to buy clothing, shoes, and purses (for her store) and groceries to prepare her delicious dishes.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a big restaurant in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":1007600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothes, shoes, purses for her store and food items for her catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Janina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":108.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":216.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150593,"comment":null},{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":216.66,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383695,"comment":null},{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":216.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990699,"comment":null},{"amount":216.66,"local_amount":216.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":216.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127074,"comment":null},{"amount":324.99,"local_amount":324.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":324.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517604,"comment":null},{"amount":108.37,"local_amount":108.37,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":108.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069472,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T15:18:35Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468570,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema is a resident of Malindi in Coast Province, Kenya.

Unfortunately, for various reasons, she separated from her partner several years ago. Since then she has been father and mother for her son.

Every day she begins her work at a very early hour. She sells articles of clothing for men, women, and children.

In this way, Maria will have her business well stocked. With this, she hopes to increase her sales and income, which little by little she will save so that she can assure the well-being and education of her little one, since she dreams of seeing him become a good professional and a good man.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1177124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

is a 36-year-old married woman who has three children whose ages range from three to 11. She describes herself as friendly and a listener. Susan has operated a retail business where she sells poultry for the past two years. Her business is located near a busy town and her primary customers are hotels and local residents.

Her husband lives legally in the Unites States.  He has currently stopped working due to health problems, and he is living with relatives.  Therefore, he does not financially support her.\r\n\r\nShe has devoted herself to commerce since she was 14 years old.  She buys the merchandise in a city that is 45 kilometers from her house.

She makes her sales in the city, mostly at the municipal market.  She primarily sells the jewelry for cash.  She gives credit to employees she has worked with for over three years, and she collects every 15 and 30 days.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy mostly clothes.  She will do this because the month of September sales are coming.  This is because of the Civic Festivities (Independence Day) that are celebrated in the school centers.  Also, the sales will include another vendor who will pay Alba 20% of her sales.  She will also buy gold plated jewelry and cosmetic products.\r\n\r\nShe puts forth great effort to improve her family\u2019s financial situation because her husband is not supporting the family at this time.  She hopes to grow in her sales as she will employ a cousin who is now a single mother.\r\n\r\nBy growing in her business and increasing her customers,  she will one day be able to establish a place and give self-employment opportunities to other women.  She hopes that her daughter graduates from the university one day.  That is why she works hard day after day, because her support, in a large part, depends upon fulfilling this dream.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1174971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes, gold plated jewelry, and cosmetic products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":57.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":65.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.37},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":116.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383062,"comment":null},{"amount":57.72,"local_amount":57.72,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":57.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990143,"comment":null},{"amount":48.56,"local_amount":48.56,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":48.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517180,"comment":null},{"amount":58.85,"local_amount":58.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":58.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069020,"comment":null},{"amount":58.87,"local_amount":58.87,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":58.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356495291,"comment":null},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":61.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364525237,"comment":null},{"amount":130.61,"local_amount":130.61,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":130.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133505,"comment":null},{"amount":61.1,"local_amount":61.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":61.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801572,"comment":null},{"amount":44.37,"local_amount":44.37,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814689,"comment":null},{"amount":61.95,"local_amount":61.95,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":61.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090928,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-02T02:20:43Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468544,"name":"Edgar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edgar is a married man who has two children aged two and four.

Now she buys vegetables directly from the fields in bulk and then sells them at different markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy vegetables and tubers in large quantities so that she can get a better price.  As a result, she will be able to serve more customers at the various markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is 45 years old and has three children.  Her greatest wish is to have a store in her house.  She hopes to accomplish this very soon since she already has adequate space.

is a resident of Malindi of Coast province, Kenya.

\n\n","en":"Lora is 61 years old. She is a very hard-working woman. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, Lora was left alone with 2 daughters. She searched for work in order to feed her family, but no one would hire her since she had only a high school education and no work experience. Lora began working in a cafe as a dishwasher. However, she couldn't afford to support her family on the low salary she received, and she had to ask for the customers' leftovers so that she could feed her kids. \r\n\r\nLora thought long and hard about how to solve this problem and eventually decided that the way to improve her family's welfare was to open her own business. For the past two years, Lora has been making a decent living because she now owns her own cafe. \r\n\r\nAs Tajikistan's Independence Day is approaching, Lora has come to IMON International for a loan to help her meet the holiday demand. She plans to expand her cafe offerings by increasing the range of dishes she sells. This will require the purchase of more food items.\r\n\r\nLora is grateful to the kind lenders of Kiva for supporting her in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1190329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To buy food items   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T06:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T06:40:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":285.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":289.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":301.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":301.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":321.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":332.62},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":335.27},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":345.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":356.6},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":366.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":376.37},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":387.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":285.67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":289.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316392167,"comment":null},{"amount":61.68,"local_amount":290.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":293.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323026607,"comment":null},{"amount":64.38,"local_amount":302.98,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":306.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162666,"comment":null},{"amount":64.33,"local_amount":302.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":306.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740548,"comment":null},{"amount":68.59,"local_amount":322.8,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":326.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347055869,"comment":null},{"amount":530.32,"local_amount":2495.58,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-07T15:25:32Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468667,"name":"Saumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saumu is taking out another loan so as to invest it in her existing business.

Lleva realizando este trabajo por casi 5 a\u00f1os, trabaja sola y con mucha alegr\u00eda. \n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 4 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes hacen lo posible para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado, est\u00e1 muy comprometida, una vez m\u00e1s, a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas, como lo hizo en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 2000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 prioritariamente zapatos para hombre y mujeres, para continuar vendiendo.","en":"60-year-old Isabel is a very cheerful, dynamic and entrepreneurial woman.  She is married to Asunci\u00f3n who is retired.  The couple have four grown-up children.  Isabel now lives together with her husband, two of her children and a grandson.  They live in a house that she managed to build with her other half's help.\r\n\r\nIsabel's business is selling different brands and styles of clothing and footwear.  She buys her merchandise based on her customers' orders and requirements.  Fortunately, her business is popular and she doesn't experience any problems in collecting payment for her goods because her customers are all people who work in private institutions and she finds it easy to spot those who are responsible.  All the items of clothing that she sells are well-known brands and this allows her to make good profits on each sale.  She has been in this line of work for almost five years.  She works alone and really enjoys what she does.\r\n\r\nThis is Isabel's fourth loan from MFP.  She is grateful to those who make it possible for her to continue achieving her aims.  Once again, she is very much committed to making her loan repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.\r\n\r\nIsabel will use most of the 2,000 soles she has requested to buy men's and women's shoes so that she can continue making sales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1177219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy men's and women's shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":223.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":214.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":239.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":248.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":247.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":267.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":271.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":286.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.27},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.93},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.79,"local_amount":678.17,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":686.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447508,"comment":null},{"amount":96.39,"local_amount":248.75,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":251.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053408,"comment":null},{"amount":96.03,"local_amount":247.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":250.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188333,"comment":null},{"amount":103.57,"local_amount":267.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":270.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572254,"comment":null},{"amount":105.37,"local_amount":271.93,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":275.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121920,"comment":null},{"amount":110.85,"local_amount":286.06,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:12Z","rounded_local_amount":289.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-07T11:12:13Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:22:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468679,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is 30 years old, married, and has three children who are in school. \r\n\r\nShe sells clothes in a busy environment to earn a living.

Jason is currently running a business, and these are his first farm animals (which is why the photo does not reflect any chickens).\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: \"He is able to plan his work, and no one harasses or follows him around -- it gives him satisfaction!\" His biggest challenge is \"lack of enough capital for expansion and bad debtors.\"\r\n\r\nJason was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: \"He learnt from his friends who are members of Juhudi Kilimo.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required microfinance training session: \"how to make use of the loan wisely and avoid default.\"\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is business related. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Jason replied that he will generate more income and take his children to good schools.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Jason owns the following:  a cow, poultry, and bicycle, but does not own a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile.

This borrower has in his household a mosquito net, a TV, and a DVD, but he does not have electricity, solar power, running water, or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi

His business runs well thanks to the welcoming atmosphere and his experience, and he has obtained a faithful customer base that is growing with time. His only problem is a lack of stock in terms of drinks, thanks to the small amount of capital he has, which then forces him to buy at retail from the drink stores in the area. Thanks to this loan, he will be able to obtain supplies in bulk from a set of arranged suppliers, which will allow him to diversify his stock of drinks, satisfy his customers, and increase his profit margin.

She makes credit and cash sales among neighbors, friends, family members, and referrals, who make up her list of customers. Her business has allowed her to achieve the goal she set when she started out, which was none other than to generate enough income to cover her home expenses.

Su negocio naci\u00f3 a la edad de 34 a\u00f1os, despu\u00e9s de haber sido empleada en una peluquer\u00eda al norte de la ciudad de Barranquilla y a la que dedicaba mucho de su tiempo, sin poder cumplir efectivamente con las obligaciones de su hogar,  las que la obligaron a Dolis a renunciar a su trabajo; all\u00ed  como empleada, adquiri\u00f3 mucha experiencia y  con ella emprendi\u00f3 su aventura de negocios en su propia casa; Su primer apoyo lo recibi\u00f3 de su suegra, quien compr\u00f3 su primera silla y espejo, para que  se desempe\u00f1ara en su oficio. Poco a poco gan\u00f3 una extendida clientela, que hoy la acompa\u00f1a y a quienes ofrece los servicios de corte de cabello, blower, tintes, aliser y masajes capilares. Desde hace 1 a\u00f1o se acerc\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para acceder a un cr\u00e9dito y con \u00e9l compr\u00f3 un nuevo lava cabezas, y una vitrina para almacenar sus productos, adem\u00e1s de materiales para prestar el servicio con eficiencia. Su oferta va dirigida directamente al consumidor final y tiene servicio a domicilio para su clientela, pero este no es los sus clientes solicitan con frecuencia. Su horario se ajusta a las necesidades de la clientela y usualmente abre las puertas de su negocio a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana y cierra a las 9 de la noche de lunes a domingos. Con su anterior cr\u00e9dito ha mejorado la presentaci\u00f3n de su negocio y cuando sus clientes ingresan al negocio, captan la imagen de calidad en su infraestructura y en su trato amable y la superioridad en lo que Dolis sabe hacer. Actualmente est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 1 aire acondicionado, un mueble para organizar su sala de espera, todo esto contribuir\u00e1 a que su clientela est\u00e9 atenta al servicio, por que encuentran un ambiente refrescante, contrario al incesante calor, al exterior de su negocio, causado por el rigor con que brilla el sol del Caribe.  ","en":"Dolis is 37 years old. She is the owner of a hair salon in the La Playa neighborhood, where she lives with her spouse and two children, aged 5 and 16. Her business was born when she was 34, after having worked at a hair salon on the north side of the city of Barranquilla where she spent most of her time. As an employee there, she gained a lot of experience and started her business venture in her own house. She received her first support from her mother in law who bought her first chair and mirror so she could ply her trade. Little by little she gained more clientele to whom she offers the services of haircuts, blowouts, coloring, straightening  and scalp massages. A year ago, she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to access a loan and with it bought a new hairwasher, a display case to keep her products in and materials to operate efficiently. She deals directly with the consumer and does do housecalls, but that is not something her clients ask for frequently. She adjusts her schedule to the client's needs and ususally opens her doors at 8 in the morning and closes at 9 at night. Monday through Sunday. With the previous loan, she has improved the look of the business and when her clients come in they see the image of quality in her infrastructure and the friendly treatment and in the superior quality of what Dolis knows how to do.

She believes that her work requires a lot of patience and a real aptitude.  When the right amount of time has passed and the birds have reached their ideal weight, she takes them in special cages to the city's market to sell.

She has the complete help of her older children and her partner.  What she likes about her work are the profits she receives from her sales, which allow her to cover her daily household expenses.  What she does not like is that the price of chicken feed is not stable and from one minute to the next it can go up, which means she has to spend more.

She is 31-years-old, married, and a businesswoman who has owned her own grocery store for four years.  She tells us that she began her business because she saw that the place where she lived was a really good place to open a grocery store as many local people pass by it, and thus she decided to invest her time and money in this business with the support of a family member.  Four years ago she opened her grocery store, a business which has been a great advantage for her family and for the people who live in her area.  Today she is requesting a loan to buy products like: dairy products, sodas, meats, canned goods, and grains.  This loan will be very useful for adding more products that are in demand to her inventory  for her customers, in this way increasing her sales and earnings.

Moon Lom was formed in the year 2010.\r\n\r\nThiannu (the one with the raised hand on the right corner) is a mother of two children; both children attend school in her village. She is 40 years old and her husband is a labourer at the only running saw mill factory near her village. Thiannu at first was running a grocery cum variety shop in the village.\r\n \r\nOn 15th of June 2006, she gave birth to a baby girl through a Caesarean operation that compelled her to close her variety shop as she devoted herself to taking care of the baby. She gave birth to a boy in 2008 which further occupied her time with household chores and nurturing both the children while the family expenditures were met only through her husband\u2019s meagre salary.\r\n\r\nThiannu started accessing loans from WSDS in 2010. She started her second-hand clothes business by hanging the clothes out on the roadside near her house. Sometimes, children on her back, she carries her clothes and visits nearly villages selling her goods house to house.\r\n\r\nNow, as both the children are attending school (the girl in class-B, and the boy in Preparatory class) she plans to start afresh by expanding her second-hand clothing business with this loan from KIVA.

They they live in a four-room house in Mbengwi Momo Division, North West Region Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life, including the death of both parents when she was still a teenager, sickness of children and being unable to provide medication for them. \r\nSince she joined GHAPE in 2010, she has improved her standard of living by putting in place 12 decisions. She has taken out and repaid her one loan successfully. This lady is very hard working and is determined to educate all four of her children at the higher level of education. She is involved with buying and selling fashion dresses in Mbon Market Park Mbengwi and promises that if given the new loan she will expand her business by adding jewelry, sandals, ladies slippers and also baby wear. She is very positive that her business will succeed because the demand for her fashions is very high in that locality. She has regular customers and she always supplies goods to them at low prices so that they can resale and make their own profit. She has been running the business for five years and understands the techniques and tactics needed to capture and maintain both old and new customers. She strongly believes that from this business activity, the community will benefit from low prices, regular supplies and availability of high quality products.\r\nWith the profit generated from this loan, Mercy Ijang promises to further the education of her children and grandchildren, improve the living standard of her family with the support of her husband and provide medication to the family. She says she prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, borrowers are educated on managing the loan disbursement and the organization, apart from giving loans, encourages its members with social activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1187036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothes, shoes, jewelry, sandals, ladies slippers, baby wear.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is the training ground for Kenya's Olympic runners. She has one child, and she has been in farming for four years.  Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and crops, which all go to the local market, and her employment salary. She will use the loan to buy irrigation pipes\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming:  \"She loves keeping poultry and loves seeing chicks grow to big hens!\" Her biggest challenge is \"poultry diseases, which sometimes bring a lot of loses.\" The dairy cow on the farm has been named \"Lelmet,\" which refers to one with white forehead.\r\n\r\nRuth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"She heard from existing members.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session:  \"She has learnt about record keeping.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Ruth replied:  \"From the loan, she will be able to get more income and thus feed her family well and educate her child.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ruth owns the following:  a cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, but does NOT have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, a TV, or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

She started the business on May 26, 2011 at the suggestion of her friends and because she was knowledgeable about cosmetics.

Her business strategy is to visit her potential customers and show them a catalog of products. Customers place their orders, and then she orders the merchandise from the suppliers. On average, the orders are filled in no more than 30 days. Her customers are her neighbors, friends, and referrals who buy regularly. Her main goal is to double her client base and, therefore, she strives to respond quickly to her customers. Her main challenge, however, is insufficient working capital to respond promptly to her cutomers' needs, which impedes her growth. Therefore, she has requested a Kiva loan to buy dryers, irons, massagers, hair care products, perfumes, and shampoos. The loan will allow her to keep stock and reduce the response time to her customers' orders. Slowly, she will build her own working capital and be more comfortable.

Her greatest dream is to raise her son and offer him a good quality of life and better economic opportunities to move forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1177977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a fast-food cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Caldas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-09-07T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-07T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71336},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73321},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75361},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77459},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79614},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81830},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86447},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88853},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91326},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93867},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96479}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.51},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.08,"local_amount":67962,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70731.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617825,"comment":null},{"amount":42.25,"local_amount":73474,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76468.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640738,"comment":null},{"amount":45.18,"local_amount":78582,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81784.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029847,"comment":null},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":73360,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76349.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165926,"comment":null},{"amount":48.14,"local_amount":83713,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87124.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548473,"comment":null},{"amount":358.17,"local_amount":622909,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":648292.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T15:01:41Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:48:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":465834,"name":"Marleny Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marleny aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven la actividad de la confecci\u00f3n y consigui\u00f3 trabajo r\u00e1pidamente en una empresa, y as\u00ed contribu\u00eda econ\u00f3micamente con sus padres para tener una mejor calidad de vida en el hogar.

All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

She can now be proud of educating her children, having a poultry farm to call her own, and she is also engaged in gardening. She has taken out and repaid her loans 14 times and says, if given the new loan, she will expand her business, add more chicks to her poultry farm and also do a table business. She holds the positive view that her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business. She has attended seminars on poultry farming and says the community will have quality products at low prices from her business. Her products will be available to them at all times. Also, she will give credit to trustworthy customers.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from her business, she will educate her children, provide medication for her family, add a room to her compound and also engage in the production of fruits like watermelon, pineapple, lime and lemon. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, convenient repayment intervals, availability of a loan when in demand, and the education of members before the loans are

is a widow with six children and they live in Mbengwi Momo Division, North West Region, Cameroon. She has faced so many challenges in life including poverty and ill health. She faced the death of her husband leaving her with no choice but to provide medication, education and three square meals to her children alone.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 1999 and has taken out and repaid loans 11 times. If given the new loan requested, she promises to buy chicks, feed for the chicks, chick medication and also get involved in a little bit of agriculture. From this activity, her community will develop widely. She will convince community members to buy the chicks and keep them to resell, so as to make profit. She will supply at low prices and also supply some on occasions warranting the need for chicken meat. She holds the positive view that her business will succeed because of her longevity in the business, experience and commitment.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, she will educate her children, provide medication for her children and also take care of other children of the family. She says GHAPE loans are preferable because of the low interest rate and no collateral before loan

She is raising her hand in the photo. She is widowed and mother of seven children who are all studying. Her husband died around 2005 after a short illness. During this time, she has provided for her children's expenses by herself. These expenses weigh heavily on the rapid growth of her business. She sells sweet drinks and is a member of a small hardware shop. She has been in this business for eight years. She started her small business with her own money, received from her deceased husband. Later, she benefited from a loan from the IMF Hekima program. This new loan will be used to buy five cases of Fanta. The client permanently thanks IMF Hekima for the loans she receives without any material security because thanks to these loans, she has been able to build a wooden house with 10 rooms, which she rents out. The income from the rental of this house allows her to provide for her children's

Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, she separated from her partner some years ago and has been the head of her household ever since and has put all of her efforts towards getting them ahead. Gabina is very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic. In her free time she likes to go walk by the river near her house. She wasn't able to study for a career since she began working at a very young age to help her parents cover their expenses. Sometimes she cooks a delicious Lomo Saltado [beef stir fry] to share with her children.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of dedication and enthusiasm, Gabina works daily selling snacks door-to-door. She has a small tricycle that she uses for her sales. Every morning she starts working early and works for about 10 hours a day. She believes it's going well due to the variety of sweets and friendly treatment that she gives her customers.\r\n\r\nGabina is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since with their support she will be able to buy merchandise (snack food) like caramels, cookies, lollipops, appetizers, among other things. This way her business will be better stocked, which she hopes will increase her sales and her income. That will help her to save little by little in order to buy a new tricycle. She will continue working hard so that she and her kids can get ahead.

is married with five children and they live in Mbengwi, Momo Division, North West Region, Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life which include the death of most family members, sickness in her family and poverty.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 2003 and has taken out and repaid six loans with the recent loan being 200,000 FRS. She promises that, if given the new loan requested, she will buy a new motorbike for commercial purposes. She is positive her business will succeed, because she has been in the business for a long time. The bike will be given to her child, who will be solely responsible, and as such will take care to avoid accidents and also do his best possible to maintain the machine at all cost. The community will benefit from this business because the bike will help to transport farmers from their houses to the farms and also carry their produce to the market. It will also help to transport students to and from school at low prices and also transport workers to and from their job sites.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she promises to educate her children and grandchildren and provide medication for her family. She will buy farm seedlings because she is involved in a little form of agriculture. She will also pay registration fees for her daughter, who will be writing the general certificate of education. \r\n\r\nShe says she prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate and convenient repayment intervals and because all the members are educated before the loans are disbursed to ensure good management of their

With the new loan requested, he plans to buy more provisions like bags of rice, cartons of soap, cartons of maggi and other items.  He holds strongly to the fact that his business will succeed because he has regular customers, he has been doing it for a long time and he is the only person who sells such items in that locality.  From this business, the community will have regular supply at all times, credit facilities will be offered to regular customers, goods will be sold at reduced prices and a variety of goods will be made available to the community to enable them to consume what they desire, not what they find available.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, he plans to educate his children, buy medication for his family and make sure his family eats well to avoid many illnesses.  Ernest says GHAPE loans are preferable because of low interest rates, education before loan disbursement and convenient repayment intervals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1187118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They work in various jobs that allow them to contribute to the household finances and live in different places in the city of Cuenca.  This city has colonial and modern architecture and a cold climate, and the people there are hardworking and still preserve the culture and traditions of their communities.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Nube, who's on her third loan with this communal bank.  She lives near the Jaime Roldos residential complex in the city of Cuenca.  She's 46 and married, and has six children from this relationship.  Two of her daughters are married and live independently, two of her children work and help her financially, and the last two attend school in the town.  Her husband's a professional driver who drives a school bus.  Together they built the house they live in.\r\n\r\nNube works taking care of her home and family.  Also, to help her household financially she works in business selling clothing, cosmetics, and plastic Tupperware products.  She has done this work for 10 years and she works from Monday through Saturday with no fixed schedule.\r\n\r\nShe's going to invest her new loan in buying clothing, cosmetics, and Tupperware products to have more variety for her customers.\r\n\r\nAs she's a small businesswoman, her goal is to continue growing her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5800,"image":{"id":1178060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

From the current business that she has been with for several years, she is able to earn about 22,000 KHR per day and save about 16,000 KHR each day for future needs.

She sells soft drinks during the week and detergents and other household products at weekends.  She says that she has operated the business for 10 years and enjoys mixing with her customers.  She tells us, too, that she struggled at first because she had a clothing sales business before that barely paid and, consequently, she was reluctant to start another business.\r\n\r\nThis is Juanita's first MFP loan.

He and his wife, Dora, have three grown children.  They live together, along with a young grandson, in a house that they scrimped and saved to own.  \r\n\r\nKreiver operates a mototaxi business.  He started the business 15 years ago with a loan and his own savings.  Mototaxis quickly wear down from daily use and Kreiver has had to repair and replace his over the years.  He says that he likes the business because it provides a steady income for supporting his family.  He adds that he started it because there was no paid work at the time and he needed a way to make a living.  For the best, as it turns out, because he likes being his own boss and setting his own hours.  His greatest challenge, he says, is maintaining his vehicle.  When the mototaxi breaks down, he has to figure out how to repair it quickly so that he can go back to work.   \r\n\r\nThis is Kreiver's second MFP loan.  He is grateful, he says, that you are willing to help him meet his goals.  He adds that he likes his community bank because its members are helpful and supportive.  \r\nKreiver will use part of this 1000 new soles loan to carry out vehicle repairs--new seat covers, etc.--and the rest to save for his next mototaxi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1178170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Manzura's first loan from IMON International. She is a conscientious and hard-working young woman. Manzura was born in the countryside in the family of a shepherd, and even as a child helped her father raise livestock. In 1997, she entered the first grade of secondary school. She was a good student, actively participated in extracurricular activities, and successfully finished grade 11 in 2008. In that same year she became a correspondence student at the Tajik Technological University. When Manzura was in her third year of university studies, her only brother was suddenly taken ill and needed a large sum of money for his medical treatment. As Manzura's father is a shepherd and her mother is a nurse, they were unable to find such funds. At the same time, the family needed to pay for Manzura's education. After paying his only son's medical bills, Manzura's father was unable to cover her tuition, and Manzura was expelled from university. Despite this setback, this year she has enrolled in the Tajik State University. \r\n\r\nManzura's family has no source of income other that her mother's salary. For this reason, Manzura has turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to pay her tuition. She is counting on your financial support and would like to receive higher education in order to serve her country in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1190506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To pay for her university studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-09-08T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-08T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":420,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.27},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.3,"local_amount":67.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-28T10:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":68.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":316392180,"comment":null},{"amount":32.85,"local_amount":32.46,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":32.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162670,"comment":null},{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":68.86,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740552,"comment":null},{"amount":72.63,"local_amount":71.78,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":72.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801589,"comment":null},{"amount":34.9,"local_amount":34.49,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":34.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915142,"comment":null},{"amount":36.7,"local_amount":36.27,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":36.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381692892,"comment":null},{"amount":36.93,"local_amount":36.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":36.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390555692,"comment":null},{"amount":73.01,"local_amount":72.14,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":73.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400549581,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-08T18:10:44Z","paid_date":"2013-09-21T08:50:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469046,"name":"Raul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raul is 34 years old and lives in the Philippines.
