The family earns a living through agricultural business.  They have a plot of land, where greens are grown.  Zaza sells harvested greens at Kutaisi (a nearby town) market. The total average monthly income of the family is 150 Laris per month.  According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the category 'subsistence poor'. \r\n\r\nManana has requested credit for the construction of greenhouses.  Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Manana will purchase materials to construct greenhouses (iron pillars and polyethylene) and vegetable seeds. Zaza and Manana will grow greens, cucumbers and tomatoes in the greenhouses throughout the whole year.  They will sell the harvested products on Kutaisi Market.  The income of the family will significantly increase.  They will be able to combat their poverty and in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of

David\u2019s wife is an emigrant; she works abroad and assists her family financially. \r\n\r\nDavid earns a living through agricultural business. They have a milk cow and 200 nut trees. Dairy products are mainly consumed by the family; a small surplus and the nut harvest are sold in the Zestaponi District by David. Total average monthly income of the family from the above-mentioned activities is 150 Laris. David\u2019s wife sends them money monthly, but still, according to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nDavid requested credit for the start up of a small poultry farm. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with easy conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.\r\n\r\n With the received credit David will purchase chickens and place them in the old hen-house, located in the family yard. Also, part of the credit will be used for purchasing feed for the chickens.  He will grow chickens and start selling them in 3-4 months. Also, David will sell eggs as well. According to his estimations, the monthly income of the family will increase by 300 \u2013 350 Laris. That will mean a 100 \u2013 133% increase. The family will be able to improve their living conditions. In addition to the above-mentioned, in the future the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, for further expansion of their new business.

Its population is rapidly growing and there is a great deal of trade that takes place at the wholesale livestock markets.  The average temperature is around 25.5\u00b0C, but sometimes it gets up to 38 \u00b0C.  The entire province of Santo Domingo de Los Ts\u00e1chilas lies in the mountainous territory along the western coast.

Santo Domingo is located in a tropical area of Latin America and is a newly-created province that was formed in 2007.  \r\n<p>\r\nWilson has been a metal worker for three years.  He learned the trade from his father and continues to work with him to this day.  Wilson is taking formal classes, but he needs money to complete his thesis.  He also needs a small amount of money to buy materials for his work.  For this reason, he submitted a request to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, the intermediary organization that is connecting Wilson to a Kiva loan so that he can complete his personal objectives.  Even though he is receiving his first loan, the credit assessor's evaluation determined that Wilson is at low risk of default.  \r\n<p>\r\nWilson works six hours a day.  His job is of considerable risk since welding metal objects emits gases that are highly toxic.  Despite this risk, he continue with his work since it is his current means of support.  Wilson is very optimistic of receiving his professional degree in the near future.  His dream is to earn his degree and eventually build a house of his own someday.

In 2011, while looking for a source of income for her family, Mairamkan launched her own retail business with an initial investment of 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her persistence and hard work, Mairamkan was able to grow her business so that it currently earns 10,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, the assortment of goods in the store is not very wide, and so Mairamkan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to expand the range of products for sale. She is planning to use a part of her profits to repair her apartment and to invest the remainder into further development of her

She makes a living by caring for children.  She does this for about 5 hours a day, mostly with children whose parents have to work, and they don't have anyone who can care for their little ones.  She believes that her business is going well because she is very loving with the children and because they are like delicate and fragile little people.  They need a lot of care, and their parents have a lot of trust in her that she takes good care of them.\r\n\r\nIvette is very thankful to the Kiva lenders.  Because of the support they have offered her, she will be able to make improvements to her home to give more safety to the children she takes care of.  In particular, she will have special floors put in for the children, educational games, etc., to give them better service.

Today, the selection of products is limited, and this is why Sveta requested a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

married.  As a source of income for her family, Jamalbu started a field crop farming and animal husbandry business in 1985.

old, a widow and raised four children.  In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1980 with an initial sum of 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kermekan's persistent and hard work, her business, containing 10 sheep and a dairy cow, now yields about 6,000 som (KGS) from sales of milk and milk products.  In order to further develop her business, Kermekan requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy bulls for fattening up and resale.

is 38-year-old Maurice.

He learned a lot about how to run a successful business from helping his uncle. He is excited that he has finally started running a business of his own. He says he gets immense satisfaction knowing that the money transfer services he provides make people\u2019s lives easier.\r\n\r\nMaurice\u2019s small shop is located in Kamwala, one of the busiest markets in Lusaka. This means that he has a lot of customers coming to his shop. Sadly, due to a very low working capital, he cannot serve them all. He says this is a particularly big problem in the afternoons, as by that time of the day most of his money has run out and the banks are closed. This limits the number of customers he can serve in a day to a mere 10-20, when, if he had more money, he would be able to serve more than 50 customers.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets the Kiva loan, he will use the money to increase his working capital so that he can serve more customers and make more profits. In the future, Maurice plans to open another shop to increase his profits so that he can take care of his growing family and send his daughter to college.

She sells live embers and cassava flour. Her husband is an evangelical mediator in a revivalist church. Six months ago she was informed about the micro-loans that IMF-Hekima grants and thus she was given her first loan of US$50 in order to begin her business. The profits she makes from her activity are used for her savings, to buy food and to help out with her children's schooling. Meanwhile, she has been granted a second loan. During this period, the customer has seen her business prosper and so she has decided to increase her loan for this new cycle. This new loan will enable her to get fresh supplies: three sacks of live embers and one sack of cassava flour. For the future she would like to see her children grow up buy a piece of land. The customer thanks Hekia for its actions to help poor women with low income become autonomous.

She sells these items door to door. She goes out everyday, walking around her neighborhood offering these products and collecting money every eight days from those who pay with credit. She benefits when the fishermen arrive, as that is when they have money and when they buy her products.

She is married to Jos\u00e9 Mieles who is a taxi driver and they have a dependent child that goes to public school. She has always loved sewing. She has been sewing since she was a child. She learned the skill from her mother, who is a seamstress. When she got married, her husband supported her and she started her business by purchasing a sewing machine. She tells us that her profession is tiring as she works many hours. When she has a lot of work, she starts work at eight in the morning and doesn\u2019t finish until eleven at night. When business is slow she is concerned as then they are only dependent upon the earnings of her husband, who is a taxi driver. Wintertime is more difficult as the rain and mud do not help either of their businesses. She would like this loan in order to buy a new sewing machine, fabrics, and thread in order to make clothes for the school year.

Anarkan is also involved in sewing national blankets and rugs, which yields a small income for family's basket.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkan requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy calves.

With the profits, Etienne plans to expand the area he is using in order to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

He is married to a farmer. He has been a rice farmer for 20 years. He would like to get this loan to buy fertilizers and to support labor costs to get the best harvest of rice production. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
