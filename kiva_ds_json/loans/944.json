To be able to do this, he is requesting a loan that he\u2019ll pay back after his next coffee harvest, and with any money leftover, he plans to buy a truck so he can transport his own coffee and not have to hire someone to do it.

While providing hair care, extensions and styling to women for so many years, she often found herself having to mix several products together in order to get the results she wanted for her clients; mostly women of color. In 2006, she began a creative quest of research; trial and testing in order finalize a product that could help women of color hair types. In 2009, she started Tress Labs Inc. in order to formalize her freelance hair styling as well as to be able to trademark Formula N Hair Care, a line of natural and organic topical hair treatments intended to strengthen, build elasticity and hydrate brittle, chemically processed and natural hair types. The very first hair treatments were released this spring including Formula N Drop N's and Formula N Oil Steam Treatment. See http:\/\/formulanhaircare.com\/\r\n\r\nAll other products are still in development but for now, she needs a loan from Accion to fund the completion of her website and to help her fulfill her first large order from Ana Hair Design Studio located in Upper Manhattan. She has received much interest from other stylists and would put part of the funds towards marketing and packaging. In addition to the freelance styling she does for private clients, she also is a stylist for BET, Black Entertainment Productions. Njeri is well connected in the world of black women's beauty and has the potential to take her business to the next level. Please help Njeri get her products off the ground and help her to market them on her website.  Njeri has big dreams.

She has five children, two of whom are dependent and still in school. To support the family, she has been in rice farming on five hectares of farmland for five years and complements the income by selling cakes while her husband works as a paid worker. Having been in this business for 10 years, she and her husband are able to earn about 27,000KHR and manage to save about 10,000KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses. Drought is the main challenge for her business.\r\n\r\nSe has been with VisionFund for one cycle while the other members are just with VisionFund this cycle as well.

She wishes to strengthen her business to build a house, since she knows that both her husband and her don't have enough years left to make that dream a reality. \"I want a big house, where all of my grandchildren can come to play and eat during the weekend\", says Susana.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1180554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy over the counter medicines for her business in generic medicine sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.466667 -69.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":220,"posted_date":"2012-09-12T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-12T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":14840,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":57,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1073.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1106.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1140.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1175.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1249.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1288.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1327.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1368.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1410.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.27},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1212.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.49,"local_amount":1094.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354519,"comment":null},{"amount":74.02,"local_amount":2746.01,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2879.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315328727,"comment":null},{"amount":26.19,"local_amount":971.72,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-12T08:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331763385,"comment":null},{"amount":74.43,"local_amount":2761.35,"processed_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-12T08:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340608230,"comment":null},{"amount":11.5,"local_amount":426.79,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":447.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355753439,"comment":null},{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":1288.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1350.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364457485,"comment":null},{"amount":72.68,"local_amount":2696.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2827.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372861572,"comment":null},{"amount":76.97,"local_amount":2855.23,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-04T08:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2993.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390745453,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-13T02:27:44Z","paid_date":"2013-09-04T08:59:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470365,"name":"Jenneh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenneh is 45 years old and married with three children, ages 14 years to 25 years.

She lives in Barrio Palmira, Gulaco, Olancho. She sells groceries, an activity she succeeded in starting two years ago with great effort. She works alone Mondays to Sundays, opening her store at 7 am and closing it at 6 pm. Thanks to the loan she is requesting she will be able to buy products such as rice, sugar, butter, soft drinks, churros (long fritters made with flour and water), sweets, vegetables and many more.

She opened her store initially with some savings. She has several years worth of experience working in this field. Because of the small amount of capital with which it was funded, she only purchased the resources that were absolutely necessary and located the business within her home.

He doesn't want his children to suffer any financial privations, and that is why he works so hard.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he is applying for help to do maintenance work to the interior of his home, as without proper maintenance there can be the danger of mold developing and causing illness.

He learned about Milango through a friend who invited him to the group and he joined with an aim of accessing credit to improve on his business operations. His main challenge is high transport and fuel prices from the farm to the market place. Ruwa is applying a loan of 21,100 Kenyan shillings to buy goats and cows to sell.

Jos\u00e9 Luis nos cuenta que durante muchos a\u00f1os ha trabajado con la ayuda de cr\u00e9ditos y es as\u00ed como ha podido poco a poco ir aumentando su patrimonio.","en":"Jos\u00e9 Luis has been a farmer for more than thirty years. His main activity is the production of organic coffee. He is married to Alicia with whom he has three sons and two daughters. He works alongside his family in the fields and between them all they look after the coffee business, each one of them carrying out different jobs. \r\n\r\nDuring the last harvest, Jos\u00e9 Luis produced a total of six tons of coffee, which he gave in its entirety to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d [a Fair Trade-certified coffee cooperative] so that they could be processed and exported. For the next harvest Jos\u00e9 Luis needs to carry out some jobs on his farm such as purchasing plants, re-sowing and doing some cleaning and fertilizing jobs with organic products. If he does all this work in the space of two years he will grow a total of eight tons of coffee, which will improve his income. \r\n\r\nIn order to carry out these jobs he is requesting a loan which he will repay at the end of the harvest. Apart from producing coffee Jos\u00e9 Luis also produces sugar cane and banana leaves. He has the banana leaves sown in his coffee plantations and this helps to shade the coffee plants. Jos\u00e9 Luis tells us that he has worked with the help of loans for many years and this is how he has gradually managed to increase his wealth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1185796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase coffee plants, re-sow, fertilize and clean his plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huatusco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":224,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T10:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T10:50:01Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9233.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365810677,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T11:21:33Z","paid_date":"2013-06-01T09:03:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470677,"name":"Clarance","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarance lives in the Mariakani area of Coast Province, Kenya.

Perfecta sells chicken, Raquel sells clothing, Maria Isabel sells cosmetics, Cipriana Gabriela sells food and provides a dressmaking service, Angela sells footwear, and Celsa and Jose Luis sell underwear.  The group is located in a region where people grow sugarcane.\r\n\r\nPerfecta tells us that her parents only sent her to school up to high school level and then taught her to work so that she could earn a living and provide for herself.  She is the single mother of two children and has had to work hard as a saleswoman in order to provide for them.  She currently sells chicken (in pieces) and cheese.  She places her scales and her products on a table in front of her house.  As she has been selling for a number of years, she doesn't have to go out to make her sales as her customers come to her.  She also tells us that in her free time she weaves bags and blouses which she then sells to make a little extra money.  What Perfecta likes most about her business is that she can take care of it without neglecting her children.  At the same time, she is able to teach her children to work as they sometimes help her to serve her customers.  Perfecta will invest this loan in buying chickens and cheese so that she can continue making her sales.  In the future, she would like to continue building her house and ensure her children further their studies.\r\n\r\nThis group is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they are providing through this

Maria, 33, lives with her husband.  They have three children, 12-, 7- and 3-years old, respectively.  The two oldest children are now in school.  Her husband drives a taxi for a living.  \r\n \r\nSra. Maria operates a clothing and cosmetics sales business to help her husband with household expenses and runs the family home.  She stocks her business with products--clothing, Avon and Yanbal cosmetics--that she orders from catalogs and sells them from door to door.  She works two or three hours a day, three days a week.  She works in the mornings mostly because that's when her two oldest children are in school.  She takes her youngest child along on her calls because she doesn't have anyone to leave him (or her) with, but she's never given up.  She sells on credit and collects from her customers every eight days.  She has operated the business for a year and says that she is happy with her progress.\r\n\r\nSra.

The three members of the group all belong to one family and they have never worked with a microfinance group before. As a result they were a little nervous after having signed their contract, but they are sure that nothing bad will come of it. \r\n\r\n27-year old Magaly is the group\u2019s representative. She is a single mother of a daughter aged 1 year and 6 months who does not yet attend school although she is already excited about the prospect. Magaly runs a small grocery store where she sells goods that are most in demand. \u201cI used to work in Mexico City,\u201d she says, \u201c but I didn\u2019t like being so far from my daughter so I started the business so I could spend with more time with her.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe decided to open the store four months ago and she likes seeing how it\u2019s slowly grown. She doesn\u2019t like having to say to her customers that she doesn\u2019t have what they are looking for so she is seeking a loan to buy more products such as bread, milk, soft drinks, eggs, water and sugar. One problem she has at the moment is a neighbour who has run the same kind of store for many years and has many customers. However, this doesn\u2019t put her off--on the contrary. \r\n\r\n\u201cI want to expand my store and earn a bigger income,\u201d Magaly explains. \u201cI want to help my daughter get on in life, give her the best I can. I would like to see her finish university.\u201d \r\n\r\nAll members of the group are grateful for the trust shown in them by the institution as it is very difficult for them to borrow money. Gabriela will put the money into her chicken and tortilla-making business, whilst Maria will put her money into her business selling different kinds of tortillas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1185410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy milk, bread, eggs, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Juan de las Manzanas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T13:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T13:30:17Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1615.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1709.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1789.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1885.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":261.26,"local_amount":3325.14,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3448.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392128,"comment":null},{"amount":140.58,"local_amount":1789.23,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119991,"comment":null},{"amount":148.16,"local_amount":1885.63,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1955.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068040,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-13T15:23:36Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470405,"name":"Radha Krushna-1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the year 2010, four women from Podapali village of Nuapada district in Odisha, India formed a group named 'Radha Krushna' (named after the Hindu God lord Krishna and His power Radha whom they believe to be their protector) to access a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their business. Basumati is one of these women. The lady standing on the extreme left in the photo raising her hand is Basumati, aged 26, a very poor tribal lady who lives with her husband and her daughter aged 2. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. The present house where her family is residing has been allotted to her father-in-law under Indira Awas Yojana of govt. of India. (A housing scheme for landless families)\r\n\r\n Basumati has been running a general store in the local market of her small village for the last 8 years. Her husband supplements her in her business. She sells general grocery items like rice, oil, sugar, lentils, biscuits, soft drinks (sodas) and stationery such as books, pens, etc. Basumati was able to increase the variety of items at her general store with her scanty savings and increase her cash flow. Her monthly income from the existing business is Rs.5000\/-. \r\n\r\nOut of this income she has been able to manage her household expenses and she spent some income on house repair. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the inventory. She wants to increase the stock of her business. So the loan amount will be utilized to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store.This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. \r\n\r\nBasumati hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small and congested. Basumati has a charismatic dream of getting rid of poverty and mingling with the mainstream of her society. The other three members of the group are Jema, Rajanirani and Dillip who are running bakery items vending business, a tailoring center and a grocery shop respectively. \r\n\r\nSince the inception of Radha Krushna group, Basumati has been heading the group with dedication and sincerity. Other members of the group are also very happy and satisfied under the dynamic leadership of Basumati.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1190759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for purchasing rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Podapali,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajanirani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dillip","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T12:28:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470702,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is a 60-year-old married woman with four grown-up children.

A short while ago he decided to open his own business selling meat sauce since it has a been a little difficult finding work so he could help his mother with household expenses. He sells the product one day a week. The day before he goes out to get orders, and then the following day he gets up very early to prepare the meat. About midday he sets off to deliver the orders to his customers.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe meat dish sells well,\u201d he says, \u201calthough I sometimes have to walk a long way. But the important thing is that I make sales and get new customers so that my income increases.\u201d\r\n\r\nMiguel plans to use the loan to buy pork and a variety of chiles so he can continue making the food. In the future he would like to have a permanent place where customers could go to buy his products. He is a member of a group called El Triunfador. There are four other members: Candelaria and Mar\u00eda Luisa sells Mexican snacks, Hilaria sells soft drinks, and Luciano is a builder. They all live in Vicente in the Ca\u00f1era region where the sugar refinery La Margarita is located. It is the major employer in the region.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1185449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"buy chiles and meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Vicente,Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T13:50:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciano ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407696,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392129,"comment":null},{"amount":146.33,"local_amount":1911.2,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1931.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119992,"comment":null},{"amount":466.17,"local_amount":6088.8,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6153.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068041,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T16:36:54Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470711,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene lives in Calabayan, Ozamis City.

They greet each other in Mazahua, the local language.\r\n\r\nDon Eusebio, 64, and his wife, Felipa, have been married for many years.  They have four children, all grown now, with families of their own.  Don Eusebio is a hard-working man and has operated his business for many years.  He doesn't remember exactly when he started the business, but says that it must have been sometime in the 1970s.  He sells socks, underwear and other clothing pieces.  When we asked him how he started the business, he said, \"I had space in one of the large markets in town and had to fill it with something so I started my business there . . . I will use this loan to stock the business\".  Don Eusebio says that he is grateful to the VisionFund for past loans because they have helped him to grow his business.\r\n\r\nDon Eusebio works almost every day, only taking Thursdays off.  He likes the work and jokes, \"My customers like to gossip about local goings-on and I know they'll come back to pick up where they left off\".  He adds, too, that he, \"can spend more time with his wife because she helps me with the business\".  Don Eusebio will use this loan to stock his business for the busy season ahead.  He tries, he says, to keep the business fully-stocked so that he won't lose customers.  When we asked him about his goals for the future, he told us, \"At my age, I don't have any grand plans, but I would like to carry on the business so that my wife and I won't have to worry about supporting ourselves in the future\".  Don Eusebio is grateful for our help because we have always supported his efforts to grow his business and improve his quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1185302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock his retail business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2920.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3099.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3231.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3415.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3574.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3759.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":222.65,"local_amount":2920.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2939.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407692,"comment":null},{"amount":236.33,"local_amount":3099.38,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3119.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392124,"comment":null},{"amount":246.37,"local_amount":3231.05,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3252.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068037,"comment":null},{"amount":187.79,"local_amount":2462.88,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2478.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284790,"comment":null},{"amount":631.86,"local_amount":8286.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8340.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199117,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T00:20:46Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470713,"name":"Ma.

He is married to Sra. Marcelina, a housewife.  Don Jes\u00fas never had a chance to go to school because he had to go to work when he was very young.  He worked at an electricals repair shop in a small city for a few years and when we asked him how he picked up the skills for it, he laughed loudly and said, \"Well . . . the owner was my teacher, but he's 6 feet under now\".  He started his own auto repair business 23 years ago, he says and adds, \"What I most like about my business is fixing cars and knowing that my customers will be happy with my work and come back if and when they need additional work\".  Don Jes\u00fas is applying for a loan to buy the spare parts he needs to operate his business.  He usually receives supplies of spare parts 15 days after he submits orders for them.  He hasn't been able to grow the business in the way that he'd like because his supplies are expensive and long lead times are often a problem.  For the future, he wants to expand and improve his shop so that he can provide an even better service.  Don Jes\u00fas wants you to know that he, \"is very grateful to KIVA lenders and VisionFund for supporting small businesses over the years and helping me and others to help ourselves\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1031196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","use":"to fund his vehicle repair business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"J Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1463.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1497.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1532.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1568.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1604.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1642.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1680.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1719.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1760.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1801.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1843.1},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1886.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":225.78,"local_amount":2961.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407694,"comment":null},{"amount":236.44,"local_amount":3100.84,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3121.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392126,"comment":null},{"amount":375.75,"local_amount":4927.92,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119989,"comment":null},{"amount":265.34,"local_amount":3479.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3502.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068038,"comment":null},{"amount":277.87,"local_amount":3644.18,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3667.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284791,"comment":null},{"amount":143.82,"local_amount":1886.12,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1898.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T16:03:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470717,"name":"Adriana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adriana is married and has two children.

Sending them to college is very costly. Celia hopes that her children will finish their studies with her financial support. To help her husband in providing for the growing needs of their children, Celia began selling beauty soaps. She gets orders from people in her community and then purchases her products in Tumauini, Isabela. She also maintains a hog-raising business in their home. To further grow both of her businesses, Celia is requesting a loan for PHP 25,000 from Kiva lenders. She hopes to obtain a loan from lenders to have her business raise more capital.

She says that they chose this name because at the place where they meet, the owner of the house sells Mayan sculptures. In order to quickly choose a group name they decided on this one, and apart from that it's a very original name since it's one of the most important cultures of Mexico.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she has a business selling clothing for women, men, and children and says that she's had it for more than 20 years. She says she goes to stock up on her clothing in Le\u00f3n Guanajuato where they give her better prices and in this way she earns a little more. She tells us she sells her clothing at different marketplaces in her town's surrounding communities and she's very happy with this because at her age she feels useful and has her own money.\r\n\r\nShe says that she is requesting a loan to buy white stockings, shirts, and blouses for girls' school uniforms, since the new school year has just started and her customers are asking for these things, as well as blue and white trousers for boys, and skirts in specific colors to be used as school uniforms. She says that she hopes that with this loan they are giving her that she'll be able to better supply her business.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Petra, Rosalba, Mar\u00eda Elena, and Eduardo.

This group was started in 2010 with the purpose of raising the income level of the families. \r\n\r\nThe featured member, Bhumisuta, is one of them. The lady standing to the far right and raising her hand in the photo is Bhumisuta. She is 37 years old, and lives with her husband, two sons, aged 17 and 15, and mother in-law. Her sons are attending college. For the last ten years, Bhumisuta has maintained her family by running a small business making and selling sweets with the help of her husband. She specially makes a locally popular sweet named \u201cKhurma\u201d (fried dough dipped in sugar syrup). Her husband uses his moped every day to supply the product to wholesalers in the local market as per their orders. Bhumisuta also supplies sweets for functions in their village as per the order of the customer. \r\n\r\nBhumisuta and her husband cook for six hours in an open fire every day, making 50\u201360 kg of sweets with a daily expenditure of 2,500 INR. Bhumisuta needs to replenish her stock of raw materials such as dough, oil, sugar, and firewood once a week. She says that the prices of raw materials are changing very frequently and that she has been a victim of the price rise many times due to her frequent replenishment cycle. To safeguard herself from price fluctuation, Bhumisuta will use the loan amount to buy raw materials such as oil, dough etc. in bulk and then store them. This will  help her to save the repeated transportation and purchasing costs. Bhumisuta dreams of buying a four-wheeler in the near future to make the transporting and supply of her manufactured products very smooth with low transportation costs. So she and her husband are working very hard to save money to help their cherished dream materialize.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rohini, Malati, and Droupadi who run clothes and grocery shop businesses to help support their families.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1190803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for purchasing of oil,dough etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rohini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Droupadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":144000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T03:56:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470745,"name":"Adela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adela is  43 years old, married and lives in the Philippines.

Pi Hoikholhing believes that, with the additional income she earns by weaving more shawls with the Loom, she will help ease the family burden considerably.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase a hand loom weaving machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglienmawi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-13T17:48:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470748,"name":"Masika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Masika is grateful for a previous loan she received because it allowed her to buy more charcoal to sell to her customers.

Sus ventas en la actualidad est\u00e1n en un promedio de 150 a 200 tamales, sus clientes cada d\u00eda solicitan mas y ella tiene un potencial de ventas importante que le gustar\u00eda abordar, pero su capital de trabajo aun no se lo permite, por eso piensa que con su nuevo credikiva lo har\u00e1 y poco a poco, pues dice que ser\u00e1 una nueva ayuda, para continuar con la expansi\u00f3n de su negocio en el mercado y con el cumplimiento de los pedidos a clientes  que no han obtenido su respuesta.

Gracias\u201d  ","en":"We went to visit Maria and she told us that the investment of her Kiva loan in her business steadied her tamale production, and with it she was able to increase her sales and likewise increase the number of customers. She brought her family together and with her profits she was able to make repairs to her home, since it didn't have concrete floors. She built walls and a roof, which in the future will serve as a base to make a second floor.\r\n\r\nOnce these adaptations had been made, she could have her business in her own home and she stopped paying rent and this makes her feel very happy. Her current sales average 150 to 200 tamales. Her customers ask for more every day and she has a sales potential which she would like to approach, but her working capital does not yet permit it. For this reason she is thinking that with a new Kiva loan she will do it little by little. She says it will be new aid, to continue with the expansion of her business in the marketplace and to help with the fulfillment of her customers' orders which have not yet gotten her response.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan she will buy supplies and raw materials wholesale. She wants to achieve her goal of business growth, which she dreams of. Her message to those who provide financing through Kiva is this: \"I want to thank you for the vote of confidence, your support, and the help in fulfilling my dream of working as an independent person. In this moment you are participants in this dream and with your help I will have the opportunity to go forward and become a great producer of tamales. Thank you, through this noble work I have brought my family forward, offering them a better quality of Life.

Nuapada is a poor district of Odisha in which 85% of the population is rural based and out of those, 65% belongs to the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day. Among the members, Surya is the most active and hard-working lady. She has raised her hand in the photo. She has completed 46 years of age, living with her husband, with one daughter of 14 years, and one son of 16 years of age. \r\n\r\nSurya is running a bag stitching business from empty cement bags with the help of her husband for the last 10 years. Now she has two sewing machines for stitching bags. The process of her business is that her husband moves from place to place to contact different builders and contractors for collection of empty cement bags which cost Rs.2\/- per piece. At home Surya washes and dries the bags. Then her husband cuts up the cement bags and stitches small bags with his son and daughter. At leisure times Surya also helps in stitching bags. \r\n\r\nAlong with her family, Surya works at sewing 8 hours per day and stitches 300 bags in two days. Her husband supplies this product in the local wholesale market thrice in a week. As per the calculation of Surya, she gets a net profit of Rs.3-5 per bag. Apart from stitching bags she also procures ready-made bags of some better quality from other areas to add to her income. \r\n\r\nIn this process, during last three years, Surya has been able to become the proud owner of some important assets like a bike, a sewing machine, and a cooler for her family. All these assets have helped Surya directly to increase the output of her business to a greater extent. Apart from this she has also been able to marry off her elder daughter in a respectable family. \r\n\r\nSurya wants to invest a portion of this loan to buy another sewing machine to increase the volume of her business. The rest of the loan will be utilized to buy a bulk amount of empty cement bags, so that she can work for a longer period without any interruption.\r\n\r\nRegarding her future hopes Surya wants to create some assets like a TV, a fridge, a cooler etc. out of her income for the marriage of her younger daughter. She also desires to donate a sewing machine to her elder daughter as her daughter intends to run a similar business for her financial sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of her group Rajani, Golapi and Phulmati also run different businesses: Computer\/photocopy\/photo studio, vegetable vending and a cloth business respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1190743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to pay for purchasing a sewing machine and empty cement bags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rajani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Golapi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phulmati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":124000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":124000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T14:07:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470752,"name":"Nasri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasri is a 57-year-old widowed man, father of five children.

de 31 a\u00f1os de edad,  vive en un municipio artesanal de la Costa Caribe, muy cerca a la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias. Su vida transcurre entre su trabajo en su tienda  y su familia conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y su hijo de 6 a\u00f1os de edad. Deyanira desde hace 2 a\u00f1os se dedic\u00f3 a la actividad comercial,  vendiendo mercanc\u00edas mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos,  como ropa, calzado y cosm\u00e9ticos, actividad con la que le fue muy bien y logr\u00f3 agregar ingresos a su hogar, adem\u00e1s de ense\u00f1arle su oficio de comerciante. Cuando se mud\u00f3 cerca a la carretera troncal en su pueblo, percibi\u00f3 el peligro que corr\u00edan los habitantes del pueblo al cruzar esa v\u00eda, al comprar  diariamente sus v\u00edveres y los art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar que en su familia consumen. Este hecho le dio la idea de adicionar a sus ingresos un nuevo negocio,  que fue el montaje de su propia tienda para venderles tambi\u00e9n, art\u00edculos que sus vecinos requer\u00edan, como lo que hoy hace al comercializar productos de primera necesidad, ranchos, v\u00edveres, refrescos, l\u00e1cteos etc., ropa  y calzado. Con su negocio ha visto el progreso desde su propia casa al generar ingresos; su proyecto futuro es hacer crecer  su tienda para aumentar los ingresos de su familia. Deyanira realiza sus  ventas diariamente y de contado principalmente, mientras sus compras las realiza una parte a cr\u00e9dito y otra parte  de contado.  Ella tiene un gran desaf\u00edo que superar y es el de no tener, muchas veces,  los productos que sus clientes necesitan, por eso se ha acercado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para aplicar a su primer credikiva con el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres que rotan f\u00e1cilmente como arroz, az\u00facar, aceite, l\u00e1cteos, enlatados y refrescos.   Con esta inversi\u00f3n proyecta mejorar sus ventas con m\u00e1s art\u00edculos y aumentar el n\u00famero de sus clientes fijos. Su meta es mejorar sus condiciones habitacionales y terminar sus estudios, lo cual le significa tambi\u00e9n un gran desaf\u00edo personal. ","en":"Deyanira, 31, lives in the artisanal community of Costa Caribe very near the city of Cartagena de Indias.  Her life unfolds between her store and her family composed of her spouse and six-year-old son.  Deyanira has been a merchant for two years;  she started selling merchandise like clothes, shoes and cosmetics via specialized catalogues .  She did very well with this activity and was able to contribute income to her home in addition to learning how to be a merchant.\r\n\r\nWhen she relocated near her town\u2019s main highway she realized that residents in the town exposed themselves to danger crossing that highway to buy basic staple items their families consume every day.    This gave her an idea for a way to increase her income with a new business which was to open a store of her own to sell products to her neighbors that they needed and has been doing so to date; she sells basic staple items, snacks, foodstuffs, soft-drinks, dairy products, clothes and footwear, etc.  With her business she\u2019s seen her home improve as she\u2019s generated income.  Her future project is to make the store bigger thus increasing family income even more.  \r\n\r\nDeyanira sells every day and mostly for cash while her purchases are partly on credit and partly cash.  She has a great challenge to overcome which is that often she does not have everything her customers need in stock which is why she\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for her first KIVA loan to buy the items that sell the most like rice, sugar, oil, dairy products, canned goods and soft-drinks.  With this investment, she\u2019s anticipating improved sales with more merchandise and an increase in the number of her regular customers.  Her goal is to make home improvements and to finish her studies, another great personal challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1186708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deyanira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1030000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":88636},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94710},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96920},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":99181},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":101495},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":103864},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":106287},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":108767},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111305},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118835}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.48,"local_amount":88636,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":90451.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387495,"comment":null},{"amount":52.87,"local_amount":94710,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96650.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994325,"comment":null},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":96920,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":98905.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130677,"comment":null},{"amount":55.37,"local_amount":99181,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101212.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519535,"comment":null},{"amount":56.66,"local_amount":101495,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103574.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071376,"comment":null},{"amount":57.98,"local_amount":103864,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":105991.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497597,"comment":null},{"amount":59.33,"local_amount":106287,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":108464.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527409,"comment":null},{"amount":60.72,"local_amount":108767,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":110995.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928177,"comment":null},{"amount":62.14,"local_amount":111305,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":113585.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705348,"comment":null},{"amount":66.34,"local_amount":118835,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":121269.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967646,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T23:06:51Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:39:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468583,"name":"Yobana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia es la se\u00f1ora Yobana, ella tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 2 hijos, naci\u00f3 en Urubamba pero vive en el distrito de Tambo Real de la provincia de Anta del Cusco \u2013 Per\u00fa.

They are from Duajhar village under Nuapada district in Odisha, India and started a new venture to contribute to their family income by forming a group in the year 2012. The featured member, Kamala, is sitting in the middle raising her hand in the photo. She is 42 years old and lives with her husband, one son age 16 and one daughter age 13. Kamala is a very energetic and hard working lady. She has been running a cloth weaving unit in her house for the last 25 years. Now she is managing her business successfully with three weaving units. In two units, she is weaving saris and in one unit gamchha (towels). Kamala has engaged three skilled laborers to help her with the weaving. They produce three saris and three towels per day. Kamala pays Rs 100\/- per sari and Rs 50\/- per towel as labor charges to the weavers. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread per unit costs around 10,000\/-) from a stockist in a nearby town on credit and gives the finished products to the same stockiest who does not give as much return to her compared to her efforts. Therefore,  she is running at a continuous loss and facing a lot of trouble maintaining her family.  So she is planning to use the entire loan to purchase more stock of raw materials like yarn. This will help her to eliminate some unnecessary expenses resulting from frequent movements to bring in raw materials. The role of Kamala in the business is to process the thread. Sometimes her daughter also helps her in this processing work. Kamala hopes to repair her house and wants to purchase some assets for the marriage of her daughter. \r\n\r\nIndra, Sasidei, Rukmani and Sasi are the other four members. They are running a medicine store, a cloth business, a utensils business and atailoring business, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase yarn\/thread for weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Duajhar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T18:30:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rukmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T05:24:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471240,"name":"Manzura","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 19 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430 2-\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u044b \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0435\u043c \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0448\u044c\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u044b \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0415\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0436 \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u0443 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u044b. \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 750 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u044b \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.","en":"Manzura is a very capable and talented woman.

She is a very active lady of BPL (below poverty line) category. For the last 10 years, she has been running a tent house (giving bowl, tent, cloth boundary wall, chairs, light, sound system etc. rented for social functions) with the help of her husband. She initially started the business with limited items like bowls, chairs, tarpaulin etc. As she owned a small house, she stored some items for the tent house in her house and some items in a rented house.  At that time, she was earning a monthly income of Rs 4,000 per month. With her limited earnings, it was very difficult on her part to manage her household expenses. With the present loan, Tilottama has decided to purchase a sound system, some more chairs, bowls, drums, mats, pillows etc.to rent, taking into consideration the present demand. This will help her to generate extra income to meet her immediate requirements like providing a better education for her children in the nearby advanced school. She has a long-term vision to construct a go-down (warehouse) of her own to keep the tent house materials safely as at present she is keeping the materials in a rented go-down (warehouse). The other three members of the group are Kumudini, Laxmi and Bisaya who sell betel nuts, run a grocery shop and run a tiffin (light meal) restaurant.

She earns a monthly remuneration of Rs 1,000\/-. In comparison to the family needs, the income from the above sources is not sufficient to meet the day-to-day expenses of her family. So, looking at market demand and their traditional occupation (raising cows), in the year 2010 Jamuna purchased a cow and started a milk business. Presently, she is getting 6 liters of milk per day from a single cow and supplying it to a tea stall in a nearby town @ 16\/-. This additional income helps her to a great extent in maintaining the educational expenses of her two sons. Looking at her success in the milk business. Jamuna has planned to invest a portion of her loan to buy another cow of the jersey variety and the rest to repair her cow shed to get more output. Jamuna dreams of developing a dairy farm in the future and supplying milk to the milk processing plant.

","en":"28 year-old Karine started her own business in 2010. With two years of legal experience, she rented some space and opened her own small law office. Karine works on relatively small cases, but hopes that the experience she gains will enable her to expand her business in the future. Karine doesn't take days off and works late into the evening.

61, is a widow and mother to three adult-aged children. She lives separately with her grandchild in San Manuel, Isabela. She is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP as additional capital for her fish selling business that she has already been managing for 25 years now.\n\nAll of her children finished college by means of her selling fish in public markets.

years old.  He is a conscientious and hardworking man, who is married and raising an adolescent son.  His father works as a driver and is also simultaneously involved in animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops with Davron.  Davron has plenty of experience in animal husbandry and farming.  He primarily grows wheat, barley and potatoes.  He uses a portion of the harvest as a feed for livestock and sells the remainder to the local residents.  A large number of this village population buy wheat and then obtain flour at a mill and bake bread for personal consumption, and use the waste from the wheat to feed livestock.  According to Davron's words, he has good conditions for animal husbandry, but does not have enough financial means to purchase livestock.  He wants to use the resulting income to improve his household conditions.  He is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 somoni to buy five cows.  He awaits your kindness."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1192978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy five cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-09-13T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-13T23:10:06Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2100,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10005.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T14:40:09Z","paid_date":"2013-03-02T09:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468628,"name":"Sebastiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sebastina  pertenece al banco comunal \u201cRICCHARIY PURIRISUN\u201d de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa, ella  vive  en la ciudad de Oropesa provincia del Cusco, ella tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene dos hijos.\n \nSebastina  se dedica a la venta de frutas de forma ambulatoria, ella vende ofreciendo sus productos de forma ambulatoria.

He is 51 years old, married and raising four children.  Since childhood, he dreamed of becoming a driver, travel to new places and meet new people, inspiring himself with new emotions.  Life's economic reality prepared different expectations for him.  He is unable to provide his family with all of the necessary means, and meeting new people seems like a far reach for him now.

Three of his children go to school.\r\n\r\nAlbert works as a seller in one of the neighborhoods of the capital city, where he has been running a clothing and jewelry shop for the past ten years already.\r\n\r\nThanks to the quality of his products, to his reasonable prices, and to his own enthusiasm, Albert has been able to build a large customer base.  However, since he is constantly out-of-stock, some of his customers are no longer faithful to his business.\r\n\r\nThis is why he is requesting this loan, in order to purchase clothes, jewelry and phone accessories, and therefore increase his stock of merchandise.  He hopes that this will help him to regain customer loyalty and and to increase his profit margin.\r\n\r\nHe would like to use his profits to reinvest in his business, and he dreams about opening new

She learned this skill from her mother, who always accompanied her. Today, she sells clothing and shoes, especially for the beach since she lives in a tourist city near the Caribbean Sea. This type of clothing is needed here due to the atmosphere of the beach, the breeze, and the sea by this historic, fortified city.\r\n\r\nAmelia is currently separated and is a mother of two children ages 5 and 7. She works hard because she dreams of seeing her children as successful professionals. They are her motivation to work hard as a merchant.\r\n\r\nAmelia sells sweaters, blouses, shorts, shoes and other items to new and regular customers who request this merchandise, which she buys in the city of Barranquilla when she recoups her working capital. The majority of this capital comes from her accounts receivable. Her main customers are found on the beaches of Cartagena and Barranquilla, and they are mainly tourists looking for the clothing options that Amelia offers. She sells from 8am until 5pm and her purchases are made weekly in cash at places that have constant promotions and sales that are convenient for her, and especially for her customers. In the future, her goal is to have her own home by working a lot and saving for this accomplishment. She is currently applying for a Kiva loan and this is the first time she will receive financing from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will buy beach clothing with the loan, which is the most popular among her regular customers. This will increase her sales volume and earn more profits, which will benefit her family and especially her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1187167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy beach clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":830000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90406},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97680},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":99959},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":102291},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":104678},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":107121},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109620},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118245}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.74,"local_amount":90406,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":94267.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387496,"comment":null},{"amount":423.26,"local_amount":739594,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":771182.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928178,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-15T23:06:51Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470797,"name":"Luciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciana is a 52-year-old married woman who resides in Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

He is a plumber by profession and people from his city hire him constantly. Osvaldo is a modest person, and he was always used to work the land. \r\n\r\nA while ago, Osvaldo used to drink a lot and he lost all he had. His friends spoiled him and when he needed help to continue working these friends did not appear. That's how Osvaldo learned to be wary of others. Now he lives only for his family and is entirely dedicated to work in order to not bump into friends that destabilize his welfare. He is saving to make a modest construction in his plot for his family's comfort.\r\n\r\nHe heard about Kiva loans and decided to request help to provide capital for the purchase of chickens for sale.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 32,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarcelina hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMelania maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMelania hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is a carpenter and supports himself by doing woodwork, which at times is difficult to obtain.  Edgar is a humble and calm person, who learned carpentry from his father along with his brothers.  They acquired many clients and became known in the market place for their woodwork, and eventually they all became independent.  Thus Edgar acquired his own workshop.  However, without realizing it he became dominated by alcohol and over time wasted what he earned and was neglecting his family.  He reflected on things and dedicated himself to his family and his work.  In time he suffered a misfortune, when the engines of his main machines seized up.

For the last 20 years, Chanchala has been running a cloth weaving business with her husband. She has one weaving set. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread for weaving saris from a trader in a village 20 kms away. A bundle of thread produces 80-100 pieces of saris and costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Chanchala does the initial processing of the thread to make it ready for weaving. After that, her husband fits it to the weaving machine and starts the weaving work. Chanchala\u2019s husband works around 8-10 hours a day and weaves a single piece of sari.  On a weekly basis, Chanchala sells saris to the local traders in her village. She earns a monthly income of Rs 3, 000, which is not sufficient to maintain her family. Chanchala wants to buy thread\/yarn in bulk with the loan. Purchasing more stock at one time will help her to reduce the purchasing cost of the raw materials. Chanchala wants to increase her business and save enough to complete the construction of her house.\r\n\r\nUpama, Ujal and Bhanumati are the three other members of the group who are running a general grocery shop and a cloth weaving business, and getting support from their husbands for the over all development of their families. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhuliasikuan,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Upama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ujal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanchala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhanumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-14T23:47:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467679,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Magdalena, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNorma hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It is a group comprised of four women members of the village called Dumerbahal. It is located in the Nuapada district; one of the poorest districts of India. One of the members of this group is Dibyarani who has raised her hand in the photo. She is 26 years old and her family consists of her husband, one small daughter, father in-law and mother in-law. Dibyarani has been running a small bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband for the last 12 years. In the factory, bakery items like bread, cream roll and toast etc. are being prepared. She has engaged four skilled laborers for the processing and making of the bakery items. Her husband supplies the products to three or four nearby towns within a 40 km radius. Dibyarani says owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locals, but due to a shortage of stock she could not meet their demands. She does not like to say \u201cNo\u201d to her customers and wants to give better service to her customers. She now wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, etc. to increase her production level to meet the demands and grab her customers. A portion of the loan will be used to purchase raw materials in bulk, which will reduce her purchasing and transportation costs. As the present location of the factory is in her residence, Dibyarani wants to construct a separate house in a prominent place in her locality to run the business smoothly. She also hopes to save money from the sale proceeds for provide a better education facility to her only girl child.\r\n\r\nThe other three active members of the group are Nabina, who has a sweets-making business and grocery shop, Jajnaseni, who sells and supplies bakery items, and Rangalata who has a grocery business and hopes to provide better education to their children and increase their living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase oil, dough, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Dumerbahal,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dibyarani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jajnaseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rangalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T14:42:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471564,"name":"Orokia's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme OROKIA repr\u00e9sente le groupe DIOUGOU SOMPRIN.

Its five members are all women who belong to the Below Poverty Line category (BPL) from the village called Gadramunda.

The lady sitting in the middle raising her hand is Panchu. She is 29 years old; living with her husband, three sons aged 10, 8 & 5 years and one daughter who is 2 years old. She is a very active lady and fond of cooking. She has been running a snacks & sweets-making and supply business at her house with the help of her husband for a couple of years. She initially started with two varieties and slowly expanded to three different varieties. She, along with her husband, cook local salty snacks named 'Namkin' (locally popular food of triangular shape and salty in taste), \u201cGaja\u201d (fried dough dipped in sugar syrup) & Ladduu (one type of round shaped sweet) and make packages. Her husband travels to the surrounding villages selling to local shops there. He travels almost 40 km in a day. She and her husband spend almost four hours a day making snacks and packets and selling them.  In this process, her family earns a profit of rupees 200\/- to 250\/- daily. For raw materials like cooking oil, sugar and dough, her husband travels to the nearby town frequently every three days and spend more time and transportation cost. She now wants to have a stock of raw materials like cooking oil, sugar and dough, so that they have enough stock to carry on their business regularly with out any intervention. Panchu has planned to use a portion of the loan to buy the raw materials in bulk, saving the transportation cost and getting a cash discount. She hopes to complete her half-built house and start a screen printing business as her husband has sufficient experience in that field by using the rest of her loan. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Sasirekha, Jachana, Pana and Suraj and they have businesses like selling milk, running a grocery shop and cultivating vegetables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase dough, sugar, oil etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sasirekha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Panchu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jachana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suraj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T08:11:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":470625,"name":"Maa Maheswari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The name of this group is Maa Maheswari (named after a village deity of the locality). All four women members of this group belong to Kurebhana village in Bolangir district in Odisha, India and are in the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category.

He does daily labor and earn a very small income. Saila runs a milk processing unit at her house. She has only one cow, which produces 8 to 10 liters of milk per day. As the milk is not sufficient, Saila and her husband go to three or four nearby villages and collect 200 liters of milk per day to process and produce milk products like Paneer, Chhena (cheese), butter, ghee, khua and Peda (a sweet item made of khua) and sell them to earn an income of Rs 400 to Rs 500 per day in the off season (August-October). In the peak season, i.e. in the marriage season, (November-July) they earn Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per day by selling the milk products. She employs a person to help her in the processing. She has a small freezer to keep the products and supply in the market but it is insufficient for her. With the loan, she is planning to purchase a deep freezer of 1500 kgs capacity to store the milk products for days together and sell them at peak time to earn more profit. In addition, she has a plan to construct a cement kiln for her processing unit. At present, she is educating her children in the nearby high school and college. As providing college education is very expensive,  she is trying to increase her income to meet the demands of her children. She has another plan to construct a house, as the present house is crowded..   \r\n\r\nThe other three members of her group (Jayanti, Sanjukta & Kahara) are running grocery shops and a milk business, respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1191624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a deep freezer and build a kiln.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kurebhana, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-09-14T04:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-14T04:10:01Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kahara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":104000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T08:58:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467693,"name":"Vangie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Vangie, 40, a resident of Manila, Philippines.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Marlyn is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarlyn hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of creating a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her business was born in the month of July of 2006 since she learned how to handle computer technology as a big hobby. Her father supported her interest, purchasing three computers for her to initiate an income-generating business. So began her road to success as she made a good profit which allowed her to add printing services for which she purchased a machine, as well as international calling, by which she went about establishing a customer base, taking the opportunity to add products for sale that might fit well with her business, such as the stationery items and frozen treats. \r\n\r\nHer main customers are students, neighbors and business employees who access the technological services and make purchases from morning until 9 at night. She exerts herself constantly to tend to her customers' every need because she wants to achieve the dream of laying the foundations so that when her children arrive to the home she shares with her husband, they would have everything ready to achieve their well-being. Currently she has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to access a Kiva loan with which she will purchase new computer equipment to replace that which has become obsolete. In this way she will provide greater speed for computer tasks which will attract ever more potential customers and build the loyalty of her regular customers, earning more and more money for her work. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":903.45,"image":{"id":1187220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase new computer equipment.
