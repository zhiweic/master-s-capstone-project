She is married, but currently separated, and as three adult children. She lives with just two of them, in addition to her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren in the house that she and her husband built when they lived together.\r\n\r\nShe has learned to be stronger over the years because of her personal life experiences. Lucy is a woman who likes to work; she doesn't like to be inactive. For this reason, it does not bother her when there is work to do. Her main source of income consists of renting out a mototaxi. She has one vehicle that she bought, thanks to the loans she has been given. This vehicle is driven by a chauffeur who gives her a ride every day for the service. She has done this for about a year. However, she has other jobs that generate income as well. She enjoys everything she does and does not hesitate in putting her best effort into her work every day with optimism. \r\n\r\nHer greatest desire is to refurbish the third vehicle she has, which is currently not working. She wants to fix it and increase her main source of income. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very happy for the financial help that they are providing her so that she will feel confident in advancing her work. Also, she promises to continue making her payments punctually as they are arranged. She is happy to belong to a communal bank because everyone is responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan sum is 1000 soles, which she will invest in making the monthly payments on her purchased mototaxi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1226361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","use":"to make the monthly payments on her purchased mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-04T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-04T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":177.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.02,"local_amount":307.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":317.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053787,"comment":null},{"amount":66.08,"local_amount":165.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":170.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188719,"comment":null},{"amount":137.56,"local_amount":343.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":355.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122290,"comment":null},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":189.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T06:08:05Z","paid_date":"2013-05-18T09:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":490153,"name":"Hak's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hak, 43 years old, lives in the Kror Kor district of Pursat province in Cambodia.

Her parents have helped her by giving her space in their house for a store where she sells a variety of products. Corali gets up at 6:00 a.m. to open her store because that is when her bread suppliers deliver to her. From then on, she serves her customers with her young child at her side. All day she serves her neighbors and other people who needs to purchase items at the store.\r\n\r\nCorali needs the loan to stock her business, as at times she lacks operating capital and the store is understocked. She dreams of having her own family and going to college, but for now her baby is young, and she has no one to take care of her. Her parents help her with housing, but they also work and leave the house for the entire day. She must care for the baby and watch the store because it is her only source of income.

The rich, traditional culinary dishes found in the area also add to the appeal of San Clemente and Portoviejo.\r\n\r\nAna is 53 years old, and lives in Portoviejo. She is a single mother, and her 21-year-old son lives with her. Ana has been an active member of the Community Bank since it's creation, and is very grateful for the community focus and the support she has received there.\r\n\r\nAna makes a living operating a clothing sales business where she travels door to door, three days a week selling various styles of clothes. When she is not traveling, she also sells clothing from her home to her regular customers, and offers payment plans on credit for the benefit of her clients.

For the past 8 years, Jane has been working hard to manage her plastic warehouse, which sells plastic cups, plates, and other plastic items. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more plastic items to sell, and will help Jane to generate greater profits and diversify income to start poultry farming. Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to construct a commercial building. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Jane who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

Las Manzanas, is a group filled with energetic women, ready to take on the challenges of the business world. When asked if they liked being a member of the group, with all smiles, the answer was a unanimous \u201cYes\".\r\n\r\nSilvia, though shy at first, actively engaged in trying to solve her personal and business problems with the support of her group. Recently widowed and having her only son live an hour away, Silvia found herself at an impasse. She had been a housewife all her life. Occasionally, she had some chickens that she sold in a nearby market, but she never thought she would one day be without her husband. Though she says that at first she struggled, she got up and decided to start, not one business, but two. Barely six months after losing her husband, Silvia has a small animal husbandry business, as well as a tortilla bakery. She currently runs them both from her home but says she hopes to one day find small shop where she can sell her tortillas. Having proven to herself that she can do it on her own, she seems more confident that her future is bright. \r\n\r\nSilvia is so proud to have found Friendship Bridge on her way. It is giving her an opportunity to have a loan so she could increase her two businesses, and so to make a living.

In his shop, he also offers mobile money transfers through Zoona. He became an agent in the year 2009 when Zoona, then called Mobile Transactions, was starting out. Being a mobile money agent means that Robby provides the service of mobile money transfers to his community and gets a commission for every transaction he does.

For the past 3 years, Joice has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joice has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fresh food like matooke, cassava and sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Joice to generate greater profits. She will manage to pay some of her child's school fees and buy new clothes for herself and the child. Joice hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nJoice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Shadia is 16 years old and lives in the town of Makidye in the Kampala south region of Uganda. For the past , Shadia has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Shadia has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Shadia to generate greater profits and save her money for future use. Shadia hopes that in the future she will be able to move out of her parents house and start renting her own. \n\nShadia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The lady wearing  a light blue  saree standing in left side of photograph is Mata who is the leader of the group. Mata is a 38-year-old woman married to a fisherman of Balugaon village in Odisha, India. The couple has a son who is in school. Mata lives with her son and together with her husband takes care of all the household expenses. She helps her husband in selling the fish. Her husband goes to the lake every morning for fishing and she sells those fish in the market as fresh fish and keeps some of them for drying. (Drying the fish is a way of preserving the fish for future use.  It is done by drying them in the sun until water is completely evaporated.)

She will be utilizing the loan to pay for spare parts and the maintenance of her arcade. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nConcesa hopes to be able to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education.

He works from 5am to 1pm and afterwards goes home, where his family is waiting for him to eat lunch together. Then at 4pm, he goes out again to continue working as a taxi driver until 8pm. In August this year, he was in an accident, which left his vehicle in bad condition and the person that hit him ran away.

For the past five years, Tamer has had a store for designing and implementing wedding cards, seals, and shields upon customers' request. This store has been a profitable and the only source of income for him, but also it needs more improvements and support to cover the cost.\n\nTamer is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the cost of purchasing new printer machine. Taking this loan will help Tamer to meet the increasing demand from customers by doing his work in high quality and less time. This will increase sales and improve Tamer's income positively.\n\nTamer is photographed inside his store.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

So, before the winter, Erdenetsogt is preparing his home and planning to install a low-pressure furnace and build a block fence around his home. For this reason, Erdenetsogt is asking for a 3,000,000 MNT loan. By doing this, his family will be provided with comfortable living conditions.

The loan will be used to purchase more hair products for the salon, and will help Phiona to generate greater profits to sustain her family. Phiona hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nPhiona  is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1228480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

According to Credo estimations, Mikheil belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMikheil requested a loan from Credo to start-up a dairy business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. Start-up loan program envisages a provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Mikheil will purchase a milk cow. After the milk cow is purchased, he will be able to receive milk and produce dairy products, which will be sold at the local open market.

Burulkan\u2019s farm includes one cow, one horse, and seven sheep. Burulkan has turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for the third time; she used her prior loans for expanding and developing her business. This time she is requesting 130,000 KGS. She would like to use this loan to buy two young cows and 12 sheep. Burulkan is a very calm and conscientious person.

Sales and profits also increased for these borrowers as a result of the increase in their business inventories. <p>\r\n\r\nHaving successfully repaid that prior loan, they are again requesting a loan, this time in the amount of 1,200,000 SLL each (4,800,000 SLL total), to further improve and expand their businesses. Salamatu, the leader of this group, plans on using her share of the loan proceeds to buy more plastic containers in order to add to her current stock.

For the past two years, Mariam has been working hard to manage her clothes store, where she sells ladies' clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan in the amount of 500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan proceeds will be used to purchase more clothes, which she expects will help her generate more profits. In the future, Mariam hopes that saving such profits will enable her to build a home for her family. <p> \r\n\r\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

She has three children but only lives with one, Lisbeth. She lives in hre own house located in Paccha. She mainly grows potatoes and corn, as well as alfalfa to feed her animals. She has cows and sheep that she brings to pasture in the countryside with her daughter when the alfalfa production is scarce. Alfalfa production is generally not enough during the summer time and what she is able to harvest she sells in the main market of her town. She also sells her animals, including sheep, cows and bulls, when the opportunity presents itself. Her animals typically are kept near her home. \r\n\r\nShe considers it good to have two types of activities running parallel to maintain income stability and progressively grow. Since she is such a hard worker, she also works packaging chicken for a company, doing so two to three times a week, as she also has to care for her animals and harvest. She has now traced concrete goals to continue growing and is certain she will achieve them. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the solidarity group \"Productoras Agr\u00edcolas Las Emprendedoras\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP.

It generates harmful chemicals to the atmosphere, and needs to have fuel added every six hours.

Mirkosim works in construction, a profession he has held for more than ten years.  He loves his family very much and wants them to have good living conditions in the future.  He has begun to build a family home, but he does not have enough money to continue.  As it is autumn now, he wants to buy the necessary building materials to cover the roof as soon as possible.  The combined income of Mirkosim and his wife is not enough for the construction of their home, which is why he has turned to our organization to apply for a loan.  On receiving the loan, Mirkosim plans to buy building materials.
