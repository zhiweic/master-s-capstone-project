She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAngie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to residents of the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by buying provisions at wholesale prices and retailing them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nAngie hopes to expand her business soon, and she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1169087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

His house in an indigenous community in the central jungle is rustic, but he owns it himself. When he was 22 he had to take charge of his first child and so began to work hard as a farmer. Due to various problems he had to separate from his partner. Now he has two parcels of land, one where he planted coffee which he will harvest for the first time next year. On the other parcel he has plantains and oranges, two products that sell well during harvest. \"This year the price of oranges was low, but with the plantains the profits increased,\" he says. Lucas hopes to achieve a good production so that he can give his children a better quality of life, but to do this he will have to acquire more farm land. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP. He promises to make his monthly payments on time. He is part of the village bank \"Nuevo Amanecer de Huacamayo\" where he feels happy because he knows a lot of people in his group.

Now, thanks to the support of the foundation and Kiva, she has achieved her goals and dreams of improving her house little by little. With the loan she will buy construction materials like sand, cement, cinder block, tin roofing, nails and other things.

He has 4 milking cows, 6 calves and 2 horses. Avtandil\u2019s wife milks the cows every day and produces cheese. The family sells cheese at the local open market. Avtandil and his wife also raise chickens. They sell hens in nearby villages. Year after year they repeat these activities because that's the way they have learned to earn a living.\r\n \r\nAvtandil requested a loan to build a cattle shed. He plans to expand the dairy farm, but the existing cattle shed doesn\u2019t allow him to implement this plan.

This family lives in a simple home they own, it's built in a community in the central jungle.  He has been working in agriculture for 15 years, he has 3 plots of land where he harvests; coffee, annatto, oranges and cassava, the last few are for his own consumption.  \" The coffee and annatto are the most viable, which is why I spend more time cleaning those plots.\", states Mario.  This past year he yielded 1800 Kilograms of coffee grain which fill about 30 sacks of 60 Kilograms each.  It is a good yield considering the size of his land.  He also harvested 1500 Kilograms of annatto.  He is able to sell his crops immediately thanks to the contacts he's made from many years in the industry.  He now wishes to have another plot of land, and to achieve it he will continue to work and purchase another plot.\r\n\r\nThis is his 3rd loan with MFP and he committs to paying on time.  He shares that he enjoys working with his communal bank, \" Nuevo Amanecer de Huacamayo\" ( New dawn of Huacamayo), due to their cooperation and the enjoyable meetings with members.\r\nThe money from this loan will be vested towards cleaning his land where he will spend around 800 soles for each on manual labor, the rest will be used to purchase fertilizer.

She is a widowed mother of five children. She makes a living through rice farming on one hectare of farmland. Having been in this business for 29 years, she is able to earn approximately 20,000 KHR per day. She manages to save about 5,000 KHR each day after daily expenses. Her main challenge is the low crop yields caused by the drought. Heng\u2019s group is composed of three members. Heng and one other member have been with Kiva partner VisionFund for four loan cycles, while the remaining member has been with VisionFund for three cycles. She has succeeded in improving her family\u2019s livelihood and paying back all the past loans. Now Heng is leading her group to apply for a loan. She is going to use a portion of the loan to pay the harvesting fee for her dry season rice and a portion to buy fertilizer and rice seed for her rice planting during the rainy season. She hopes this loan will enable her to earn more income from her paddy field so as to set aside some money to purchase extra plots of farmland to expand her farming business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1168192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay harvesting fees and to buy seed and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkul Borey District","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-08-18T17:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-17T17:20:22Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phach","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sav","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1314625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390695784,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-19T04:02:16Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T14:12:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":462147,"name":"We Are Here Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet members of the \u201cWe Are Here\u201d group from Kenema, a city in Eastern Sierra Leone.

Both were born in the zone and have only a primary school education. \r\n\r\nThey need operating capital to buy forage (soy bean hulls) to feed their cattle. This is the season when cattle-raisers store feed for the rest of the year. Efrain's activities have grown somewhat and he wishes to continue that growth in order to improve conditions of life for all the family. They live in the house of his in-laws. \r\n\r\nEfrain wants to purchase land and thus be able to construct a dwelling, since currently, his family only has 2 rooms. As a brick layer, he could do the construction himself without the very high costs of hiring laborers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1164984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a primary milk-producing area.  He has seven children.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services, and a job salary.   He has requested a loan to buy a dairy cow.  He has been doing this work for 20 years. \r\n\r\nWilliam was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan.  He said the product offered -- the dairy cow -- was what he wanted.  William was also asked what he learned during his microfinance training session: \"How to manage the loan and farming as a business.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?,\" William replied that from the dairy cow, he will sell milk and thus increase his income; the cow will also give him a calf, thus his assets will increase.\r\n\r\nWilliam also stated what is most enjoyable about farming - \"being able to get milk and being his own boss!\"  His biggest challenge is difficulties in transportation. His highest monthly expense is school fees.  The animals on the farm have been given the names of \"Chepsitie, cheborus.\"\r\n\r\n*****For this profile template, Juhudi Kilimo is making microfinance more efficient by gathering information using a mobile device in the field and sending the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper and keeping costs

Eduard en su negocio vende a almacenes y a particulares, tiene clientes fijos a los cuales les otorga cr\u00e9ditos y tambi\u00e9n le pagan de contado, \u00e9l est\u00e1 muy pendiente de las exhibiciones, ferias, mercados abiertos que hay en Bogot\u00e1 para participar y darse a conocer, porque sus expectativas de crecimiento no tienen l\u00edmites aunque va avanzando gradualmente, pero conpaso firme. ","en":"When Eduard started his business, he slowly and carefully bought each machine and part needed to equip his small leather goods shop. Today the business generates income to support his household, which comprises his wife and 4-year-old son. At 39, he has maintained his income source and dreams of prosperity for his micro business, which is the entity that provides for his family's welfare. His main goal is to fully establish his business in a commercial space on the east side, but he lacks sufficient working capital to make several investments at the same time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he is requesting another Kiva loan, which will be his second loan cycle with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy wholesale supplies and create new designs that will impress his customers and increase sales. The previous loan increased his working capital as well as his customer base, so he is very enthusiastic and continues to dream of prosperity. Eduard sells to department stores and individuals; he has loyal customers to whom he extends credit and others that pay cash. He is looking forward to participating and getting recognition at the exhibitions, fairs, and open markets in Bogot\u00e1. He believes his potential is unlimited, and though growth may be slow, it will be steady."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":1165007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy wholesale supplies and create new designs.

They both work hard in their business to support their household. They prepare and sell fried products. They prepare the food at home and subsequently sell it from a separate commercial location near their home, near the edge of a busy road trafficked by vehicles and pedestrians. This boosts their sales. Their main products are patacones, arepas con huevo, and cerdo frito, among others. Their sales are made in cash daily between 2 pm and 10 pm. Their goal is to buy tables, chairs, and kitchen supplies, as well as materials and supplies for their work. This is why they are looking for a Kiva loan.

Because of her few economic resources, Julia was only able to go to school through the fifth year of secondary education, but she would have liked to study to be a chef.\r\n\r\nDay after day Julia works in her little business where she sells food. She works about 8 hours a day and can serve up to 30 customers a day. Her partner supports her by waiting on customers when Julia is preparing the meals, and for this reason Julia feels that it is going well for her in her business because she tends to her customers well and above all her food tastes very good.\r\n\r\nJulia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to the help that they have offered her she will be able to buy tables and chairs, paint her premises, and buy ingredients to prepare her food, among other things.  Thus in this way she will be able to improve her income and her quality of life and continue striving to make a reality of her greatest dream: to have a big

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly salary of David and the pension of the mother-in-law. The average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a seven-member family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nGulo requested a loan from Credo to start livestock farming. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Gulo will purchase calves. She will grow them and sell them after several months. Grown calves will be sold for a good price, bringing additional income to the family. For the next cycle, Gulo will purchase more calves. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Their income will double and the family members will be able to improve their living conditions.

He is a tireless man who, despite his age, doesn't stop working hard and hoping for a different quality of life. Year after year, he asks God to help him with the new harvest since agriculture is very vulnerable to climate change. In this case, the harvest often does not withstand these changes and the desired harvest is not achieved. This is what happened to the previous harvest since the rains didn't allow for an abundant harvest. This situation kept Antol\u00edn from staying caught up with his loan, so it was canceled. Therefore, he is now requesting refinancing through INTEGRAL so he can buy the necessary supplies for the new harvest, which he hopes will be abundant.

is 52 years old. He lives in Martvili District with his wife Luiza and their two children (20 and 25 years old). George requested loans from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is their agricultural business and social assistance in the amount of 102 Laris per month.The family has a milk cow and produces cheese. They also have a plot of land where they grow maize. George sells cheese and maize in nearby villages. The average monthly income of the family is 202 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a four-person family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the \"vulnerable poor\" category: they get the above-mentioned monthly social assistance from the government because they are estimated to live below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start a new type of business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they as regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d on account of their low income. With the loan, George plans to purchase a truck. He will start trading in scrap iron. He will purchase scrap iron from local population, organize transportation, and sell it using his own truck. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. They expect that their income will double and the family members will be able to improve their living

Part of the cheese is consumed by the family and the rest is sold in the village. Rusudan has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start another agricultural business, but without any success.  Her loan requests were always rejected because of her family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nRusudan then requested a loan from Credo to start a new business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan Rusudan will purchase a tractor to provide seasonal agricultural services to local farmers, for which she will charge a service fee.

She lives in the Akhmeta District with her husband Shota and their 26 year old son, their daughter-in-law, and their grandchild. Her husband is unemployed; her son works in construction and her daughter-in-law works as a hospital nurse.  Their salaries are the family\u2019s only source of income, which averages 135 Laris a month. It is hardly enough to provide food for a five-member family. According to Credo\u2019s estimate the family falls into the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. \r\n\r\nLida has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start an agricultural business, but without any success.  Her loan requests were always rejected because of her family\u2019s low income and poor living conditions. Lida then requested a loan from Credo to re-start a retail business which had been recently suspended due to financial problems. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program provides credit to the rural poor who do not have access to it, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

Her partner is Oscar, 40, and they have three children. They live together in the house they bought approximately 15 years ago. She sells agricultural supplies such as manure, fertilizers, sprayer backpacks, and other products. \r\n\r\nShe has had a shop set up in the first floor of her home for more than three years. She has the support of her husband, who takes care of the heavy part of the work. \r\n\r\nFor Adela, this work is very profitable, as she always has income from the farmers who acquire their products to improve their plots of land. \r\n\r\nShe is also aware that at times she has problems, because she runs out of the sacks of manure, or another of the most needed fertilizers. That is when she turns to the loans. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She feels very happy to be able to count on this financial support and once again, she promises to to be on time with her payments. She will continue being a member of her communal bank, because she enjoys the meetings they have.  \r\n\r\nWith these 4,000 nuevos soles she will buy more bags of manure and containers of fertilizer for stocking her business.

He lives in the city of Pucallpa with his wife and their two children, whom he loves and who are his main reason for living. He is a very friendly, hard-working, and enthusiastic person. Together with his wife, he puts all his effort into helping his family get ahead. Unfortunately, due to the need to work and provide for their living expenses, he was not able to study Mechanical Engineering, as he had hoped to do, and would have enjoyed very much if he had been able to do it. In his free time, he likes to work in his garden. Sometimes, he cooks up a delicious pot of turtle soup to share with his family.\r\nThanks to his father\u2019s help, and with lots of determination and enthusiasm, Minor started his small business repairing and maintaining vehicles and heavy machinery. He has a workshop where he offers his services. He starts working early in the morning every day, and works approximately twelve hours a day. He believes that his business is going well because of his dedication and the friendly treatment he provides his customers.\r\nMinor is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to the help they have provided him, he will be able to finish building his home. He will build a wall in the back part of his house, and will be able to lay a concrete floor throughout his home. In this way, Minor will have his home better equipped to be able to provide more well-being and safety to his family. As a result, he will continue working and striving so that he and his family will be able to get

With the investment, he will have a greater number of animals at his disposal, and will be able to sell them more often, with the aim of obtaining more income that will allow him to feed his family. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy milk cows of the best breed, so that that he can ensure his family's subsistence. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1165135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy four young grazing bulls, vitamins and anti-parasite medications.

","en":"Wilfredo is 45 years old, with a good credit history. He makes polyethylene bags which, depending on his customers' orders, are used to hold various amounts of liquids. Wilfredo is a hard-working man who has lots of experience. He started his business twenty years ago. In order to produce polyethylene bags he had to furnish his workshop with all the necessary equipment, such as an extruder and sealers of all sizes. Wilfredo has done this with the help of his family, who is always by his side. Wilfredo has lived in the Achachicala district for a long time. It is worth noting that once Don Wilfredo finishes repaying this loan he hopes to take out larger loans. With the loan money he will purchase raw materials to make bags, such as polypropylene. Wilfredo is a very enterprising person, who, in time, hopes to be able to sell his products to the different supermarkets in the city of La Paz and throughout Bolivia. He is very grateful for the opportunity he has been offered as a result of receiving this loan, which will help him to improve his business.

On the one hand he will invest again in primary materials and food supplies with which he will continue increasing his work capital; he will also repair his display window, offering in this way a better quality image of his business; and finally he will buy another washer, in order to add laundry services to his business. \r\n\r\nIn his expression of gratitude for this financial support, he asks that Kiva lenders continue supporting him. His business has a great deal of potential for growth, and it is this which will ultimately carry him little by little towards achieving his dream of prosperity, which is simply to have his own house in order to stabilize his family life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1165913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It is made up of eight members and is led by a board of directors of which Eusebia is the president. Members of this association maintain a variety of businesses. Among them we have: the sale of vegetables, sale of used clothing, sale of cosmetics, sale of wholesale candies, sweater-weaving and the sale of alpaca wool, blanket-weaving, and a food shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan that they will take out will benefit small microbusinesses, among them Eusebia's. She indicates that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for six months, joining by invitation from a friend who was a member of the organization. Currently, she has a blanket-weaving business. She tells us that she learned this trade from her mother and subsequently began the business on her own.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is to increase her capital (through the purchase of wool), which she will acquire from distributors. After making the blankets, she will sell them in galleries by request. This form of work allows her to generate income to support her family, since she lives with her partner and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Eusebia responded that she likes the attention and the health and income  management training.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph, we can see a woman sitting with a child\u2014this is Catalina's cousin who often accompanies the group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":1165914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-08-19T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-18T19:10:08Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milenka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25454.53,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3006.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3206.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3207.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":459.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":431.15,"local_amount":3006.78,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495315,"comment":null},{"amount":459.83,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260865,"comment":null},{"amount":459.83,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490575,"comment":null},{"amount":459.83,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095434,"comment":null},{"amount":459.84,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235509,"comment":null},{"amount":459.83,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617346,"comment":null},{"amount":459.83,"local_amount":3206.79,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347171959,"comment":null},{"amount":459.86,"local_amount":3207.01,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3223.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914202,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-20T02:19:43Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T18:17:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":460118,"name":"Esmeralda Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cESMERALDA\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Villa Tejada, est\u00e1 compuesta por siete integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Ana Gabriel es la Presidenta.

She was a seamstress by trade and always taking care that her granddaughters learned the art of sewing. She would put them beside her when she did her tasks. That is how Rocio learned empirically how to cut fabrics and express herself in them with the styles she had in mind. Since Rocio was the only one of the granddaughters who advanced in sewing, she ended up being her grandmother's partner. When her grandmother started having health problems. she gave Rocio the sewing machines, the overstich machine and her work tools. She uses these to work in her own sewing workshop where she makes clothes for women, men and children. She generates income to support the wellbeing of her 2 year old son. She dreams of seeing him become a person with a succesful career. At 27 years old and with 4 years with this business, she plans her day to day growth. She doesn'y have enough working capital to achieve her goal quickly. That is why she is turning now to a Kiva loan, the first loan he has taken out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will invest in buying various fabrics, raw materials and more to be able to produce clothes of all prices and thus obtain more earnings for her products and contribute much more to the household expenses. That is why she works so persistently to improve her operational performance and offer high quality products.

To get there she gets on a truck that takes 45 minutes going, and another 45 minutes coming back. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy three young bulls, in order to fatten them with grazing, and to buy vitamins and anti-parasite medications for her animals. With the investment, she will have another source of income at her disposal. What she gets at the cafeteria is very little for feeding her family and for her children's education. \r\n\r\nAdela intends to save, in order to offer her children a university education.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1165114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy three young bulls in order to fatten them with grazing, and to buy vitamins and anti-parasite medications for her animals.

It is part of the central focus of the John Paul II group, is made up of 8 members, and is directed by a board with Mrs. Yola as President.  The businesses of the communal bank members are varied and among them are the following: weaving blankets, sewing pullovers and sports clothes, making furniture, selling cosmetics, selling meals, butchering meat, selling gifts, and selling furniture.  The credit that they receive will benefit small micro businesses like that of Yola, who is a group member.  She indicates that six months ago she joined Pro Mujer, entering based on the invitation of her sister-in-law who is a member of the institution.  Currently she has a business making furniture.  She states that she began the shop together with her husband when they got married.\r\n\r\nThe credit that she will now receive is for increasing her capital (to purchase wood) which she will acquire from market stalls and later make furniture and sell it in the markets of the city.  This form of work allows her to generate income in order to support her family as much as possible.  She now lives outside of wedlock and has three children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the information about health.  \r\n\r\nIn the fotograph, in addition to \"Doradas\" group members, we are able to see the daughter of member Mrs. Susan.

Her daily motivation is to try to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nShe has had financial loans funded through Kiva previously and thanks to the support provided her business grows more each day. Jessica wants to continue buying seasonal supplies in order to increase her stock and diversify her merchandise.

He decided, on his family\u2019s suggestion, to start a business, which he began with caution, but little by little he was able to find a great opportunity to generate an income.  Things have gone well for him.  He has strengthened his autonomy and so he plans to put all his efforts into making it grow, however Edgar has a great investment challenge and his working capital is insufficient to be able to expand his coverage to his clients in the market.  This is why he has requested a Kiva loan.  It will be his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which he will use to buy household and personal items.  These items sell well and buying them in quantity increases Edgar\u2019s business\u2019 profit.  His goal for the future is to become one of the largest distributors of these products and he will certainly achieve it because he is disciplined and has the ability that he needs to be successful and

works very hard every day at the rice field because he wants to stabilize his income and provide his children a quality of life. He is 50 years old, married, and lives with his spouse and three single children in a small village of Baray district, Kompong Tom province. Aside from farming, Sin devotes himself to a recycling business (buy and sell recycled materials) for more income. Through his tireless work, he hopes to satisfactorily provide the needs of his family.
