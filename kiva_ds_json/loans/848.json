Humble and simple, she lives with her mother, whom she helps a lot thanks to the income derived from her small shop, since her mother works as a cleaning lady and her income is meagre. She lives in Imperial, a city blessed with warm weather, beautiful beaches, agricultural and commercial activities. Judith went through a lot of efforts and had to save money to set up her own business of selling clothes from a small stand at the market. It was difficult at first because she did not know much about business, but thanks to her cleverness and desire to get ahead she has been learning more and more. Her business is now one year old and she attributes its success to her being nice to her customers and selling quality clothing at affordable prices. Judith is very grateful for Kiva's help, which has enabled her to buy more supplies for her shop, particularly winter clothing, as this season draws nearer. This improvement will enable her to offer a greater variety of products and she will be able to increase her income, which will in turn help her in her daily struggle to make her greatest dream come

She will be using the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nTeresita operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a typical family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food to feed one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw ingredients. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams of giving her all of her children a good, high-quality education through her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The city is known for its beautiful beaches, its cuisine and for being one of the more important Pacific ports of the country as well as the American continent. This is where we met Karina; she is 40 years old, has been married for a long time but does not have children. Her husband is a physician. She is a member of the communal bank since its inception, and she likes it because loans are quick and very low-interest. She is an odontologist and her surgery is set up at her house, where she attends to many patients, who come for check-ups or alterations to their dental work. She works every day from 8 am to 6 pm and has been in this profession for 15 years, and thankfully she has always done very well. She asks for this loan in order to refurbish her surgery: with the money, she intends to buy a washbasin for the recently-built bathroom for her patients' use as well as a sofa for the small waiting room, both in order to make the premises more comfortable so as to attract more patients. Her goals are to carry on both with the bank and with improving her professional life and her family

las cuales reciben infinidad de turistas en todo el a\u00f1o y tambi\u00e9n porque se realiza la pesca y la agricultura. Luisa anteriormente se dedicaba a la venta de ropa, pero no le fue muy bien, ya que daba sus productos al cr\u00e9dito y lamentablemente no le pagaban y poco a poco iba perdiendo la poca ganancia que obten\u00eda, pero tuvo la iniciativa y decidi\u00f3 tener un negocio de venta de abarrotes en el cual trabaja actualmente y tal es asi que ya lleva 3 a\u00f1os en este negocio; ella cree que le va bien porque atiende de manera amable y porque gracias a su negocio anterior gano experiencia y ahora sabe mucho mejor como manejar su negocio actual.\n\nLuisa est\u00e1 muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado ella podr\u00e1 comparar mas mercader\u00eda para su negocio como arroz, az\u00facar fideos, menestras, golosinas, entre otros, con lo cual tendr\u00e1 mayor variedad de productos y mejorar sus ingresos, as\u00ed seguir\u00e1 mejorando cada d\u00eda y seguir\u00e1 luchando por conseguir que su sue\u00f1o se haga realidad, el cual es \u201c Crecer como microempresaria y darle a su familia una mejor calidad de Vida\u201d.\n","en":"\r\nLuisa is a very hardworking woman with much initiative.  She lives with her husband who is her right hand and supports everything she takes on; despite working as a warehouse man in a fishing firm he always finds time to support Luisa.  Her five year old little girl also lives with them.  She is the best gift God could have given her and she tells us that she\u2019d give her life just to see her happy.\r\n\r\nHer house is located in the city of Pisco, a city that was devastated by the 2007 earthquake in which many people perished leaving behind much sorrow among the residents.  It\u2019s also well known because the Ballestas Islands are located there which receive large numbers of tourists all year round and also because of the fishing and agriculture there.\r\n\r\nLuisa used to be a clothes merchant but didn\u2019t do too well because she\u2019d sell her items on credit and unfortunately she wouldn\u2019t be paid back and gradually lost the profits she\u2019d made.  But, she got the idea of opening a grocery store which is where she works now; she\u2019s been in this business for three years now and she believes she does well in it because of the kind way she treats her customers and because she\u2019d gained experience from her previous business and now she knows how to run her current business much better.\r\n\r\nLuisa is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they\u2019ve given her she will be able to buy merchandise for her store like rice, sugar, noodles, vegetables and snacks, among others which will allow her to have a wider variety of goods available and to improve her income to continue improving each day and striving to attain her greatest dream which is: to grow as a micro businesswoman and to give her family a better

Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nNugzar and Eliso will sow maize on the plot. They will work hard during spring and summer seasons to get a good harvest in late summer. They will sell harvested maize on the local open market. Along with the abovementioned, Eliso plans to purchase a piglet. She will raise the piglet for 5-6 months and sell the grown pig for a higher price. Eliso will reinvest the profit in the same business to expand it. In the long term, the income of the family will increase and they will get the possibility of combating poverty.

He is married and is the father of 7 children, all of whom are adults. They all went to school through primary school. He began his work by helping other farmers because he had to work to help his mother. At the age of 15 he began planting one-half manzana of beans and 1 manzana of corn for consumption (one manzana is about 1.75 acres). By the age of 20 he began to produce more beans and he sold his products, planting 2 or 3 manzanas of beans, since this was his only work. Later he also began to raise pigs to sell. With loans and through his own efforts he has bought land and livestock. His children help him. He sells his products in Managua. He would like to sell in his products in another location where they offer better prices. It has gone well enough for him, even though he sometimes has losses due to weather problems.\r\n\r\nHe is applying for the loan to buy a cow and to pay for labor for planting. This loan will help him buy supplies to better prepare his planting areas and thus obtain better results. His future plans are to buy more land and livestock to have another income. His next goal is to plant 4 to 5 manzanas of beans and corn.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1081466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Two of his children are studying in the university and the last one is studying in a school near their town.  He works in agriculture and has been growing crops since he was very young.  He began using loans independently with other financial institutions but later decided to work with this group on an individual basis.  He tells us that through these loans he has managed to improve his house, buy land, and sell his harvests.  He is very energetic and entrepreneurial; as well as growing crops he has a small store where he sells rice, sugar, oil, and coffee.  \r\n\r\nFeliciano is requesting the loan to buy wheat which is a product that is often requested by his customers.  Also, he will be able to store some for when this product is scarce so as to not stop selling it.

It consists of nine members who are hard-working indigenous women with the desire to overcome and improve their quality of life. The members of the group are from a town called San Francisco Sayultepec, a little town where there are many large green trees. On the edge is a river that divides their town from a little town called Ipalapa.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Florentina, who is 57 years old. She has five children who are already married. She tells us that her work is making and selling handicrafts, such as blouses, tablecloths, and napkins. She tells us that she goes out to sell her merchandise in the neighborhoods of her community, and she goes to sell in Acapulco for a week and stays with her relatives. What she likes most about her business is sewing and embroidering, since she has liked to do this since she was very young, because her mother did the same work. One of the challenges that impedes her from continuing with her business is that sometimes she sells very little, but she also sells a lot, but when she doesn't have sales she becomes discouraged and sad. She is applying for the loan to buy more materials to make more blouses, napkins, and tablecloths, such as tablecloths, needles, ribbons, sewing thread, and strings of beads. She tells us that she is going to save her earnings for an operation on her foot, since she fractured it three months ago, but thanks to God she has had good earnings for the operation on her foot since it is hard for her to walk rapidly. She is thankful to the foundation for helping her so that she can continue with her business and above all for helping her companions so that they can enlarge their businesses and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rosalia, who sells clothing; Edith, who sells groceries; Eugenia, who sells Mexican snacks; Juana, who sells cheese; Maria de la Luz, who sells embroidery; Floriberta, who sells embroidery; Lucia, who sells embroidery; and Araceli, who sells embroidery. They give thanks to the foundation for helping them so that their lives get better every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":1079477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy material to make tablecloths, blouses, and napkins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san francisco sayultepec,oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floriberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7311.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7599.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8001.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8344.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":8743.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":557.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":636.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":557.51,"local_amount":7311.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7324.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317569,"comment":null},{"amount":579.45,"local_amount":7599.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7612.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418955,"comment":null},{"amount":610.08,"local_amount":8001.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8015.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568531,"comment":null},{"amount":636.28,"local_amount":8344.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8359.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399832,"comment":null},{"amount":666.68,"local_amount":8743.32,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":8758.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407550,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T08:49:36Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421557,"name":"Asiat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiat is 45 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala East region of Uganda.

He tells us that for more than 12 years he has grown avocados and says that he started his business because there was a lack of stable work, and working as a day labourer does not pay well. Thanks to a gift of land from his father, he was able to begin planting avocados, and although this is a long-term investment, he is already seeing profits. He says that during the harvest season in May, he will go to sell his fruit by the bucket at the wholesale food market and earn a little more. He is asking for a loan to buy organic fertilisers which won't harm the land.\r\n\r\nAuscencio is married to Petra, who works making embroidered napkins, and they have three children - Sandra, 17, who us studying at secondary school; Guadalupe, 6, who unfortunately suffered a hip injury at birth and needs therapy to be able to walk; and Alejandra, who is 3. Auscencio's goal is to buy another plot of land where he can plant more avocados and begin cultivating poinsettias, and also to buy a frame to build a nursery. The other three members of his group are called Iv\u00e1n, Imelda and Julia, who also wish to invest in cultivating avocados and buying supplies to keep their avocado farms in top condition."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":1080581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy supplies for cultivating avocado, like organic fertilisers and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T12:10:03Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ausencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":37000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2689.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2838.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2891.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2945.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3000.7},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3056.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3113.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3171.89},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3231.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3291.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3352.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3415.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.31},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":422.12,"local_amount":5528.61,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5545.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317577,"comment":null},{"amount":445.69,"local_amount":5837.44,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5855.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418962,"comment":null},{"amount":700.23,"local_amount":9171.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9199.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568538,"comment":null},{"amount":488.88,"local_amount":6402.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6422.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399836,"comment":null},{"amount":507.3,"local_amount":6644.28,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6664.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407552,"comment":null},{"amount":260.78,"local_amount":3415.5,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3426.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-20T07:05:22Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421707,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is 57 years old and married to Rogelio.

","en":"The \u201cLa Granada\u201d group has five female and one male members. This group is in the community of Dolores Hidalgo. It is a very small and quiet community. The group has always been very united and responsible with the institution. \r\nElda is the group\u2019s representative. She is 34 years old and has lived with Victor, her common-law husband, for four years. Together, they have started a family and they have two children. One child is in primary school and one is in secondary school.\r\nElda has raised and sold chickens for 14 years. She learned these skills from her mother. When she was waiting for her baby and couldn\u2019t work, she had to help her husband with the household expenses. She says that she loves to see the chickens with their little chicks. She has 30 chickens at her house with all of the chickens and chicks. This time, she has requested a loan to purchase more chickens and feed. \r\nThe biggest challenge Elda faces is when her chickens become sick and die. It is also very difficult to purchase vitamins every month because they are expensive. Many times, she does not have the resources to spend money on vitamins for the chickens. \r\nIn general, the whole group has goals and believe that with the loan, they can achieve their goals. One of Elda\u2019s goals is to be able to have sheep. Everyone is very grateful for the loan because it has helped them a lot. With the profits, they have been able to improve their quality of life. For example, they can purchase shoes, clothing, food and other things for their children. \r\nThis time, Severiana will purchase feed and medication for pigs and sheep. Isidro will invest in feed and ground corn for chickens. Ofelia will purchase feed for sheep. Eulalia will purchase food for pigs. Altagracia will purchase food and medication for pigs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1081365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase chickens and feed.

The group is located in the community of Tres Estrellas (three stars). It is a community very far from town. It is a place where transportation is very scarce and, in general, people are dedicated to farming. The name of the group was chosen since one member of the group had planted some small trees where they meet and so this is how they named the group. This time the members have requested the loan to invest in their activities like, for example, Angela will invest in embroidery, Maria Leonely, Placida and Ignacia will buy sheep, Maximino will invest in a grocery store and Magdalena will invest in perfumes. All are very thankful for the loan granted since it will all them to buy all that they lack.\r\n\r\nMaura, who is the representative of the group, tells us that she is 47 years old. She has been married for 29 years to Federico who works with her although they have two children who depend on them and who are students, one in elementary school and the other in secondary school. Maura is dedicated to embroidery such as napkins, tablecloths, relgious embroidery, decorations for tables and other furniture. \"Since I was a girl, I learned since my mother taught me to embroider but also I liked it a lot since the finished product was very beautiful\". This time she has requested the loan to buy thread in different colors, plaid fabric, and needles. The greatest difficulty that Maura faces is selling her embroidery since almost all the women in her community embroider and they do not buy like they did before. But this does not deter her from continuing to make her product since she also shows them on tables for parties like this time when we visit her she was very happy since the son was getting married. One of Maura's goals is to buy sheep and improve her house. When she sells, her earnings are beneficial to buy what she lacks at home and to pay the bills. In general, the whole group is very thankful to FRAC and Kiva for the loan granted."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":1081391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy thread, plaid fabric, needles, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Estrellas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T13:00:04Z","loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Leonely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Placida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5500},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":11002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317580,"comment":null},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11002.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418965,"comment":null},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":11002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568541,"comment":null},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":11002.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399839,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-09T15:32:12Z","paid_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421713,"name":"Jojie Lyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jojie Lyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a basket weaving business in the Philippines.

","en":"The \"El cerrito\" group is located in a very small community where transportation is very limited. The group is located at the top of a hill (cerrito). The members of the group mention that in the past, it was a plain but it has converted into a little hill. Francisca is 64 years old. She is married to Francisco. They do not have any dependents. Francisca raises and sells animals. This time, she has requested a loan in order to purchase three sheep and feed since she has to purchase it every month. \r\nShe says that she always liked to take care of animals.  Taking care of them in this way lets the animals grow big and strong. She learned these skills from her mother. The biggest challenge that Francisca faces is during the drought since she cannot feed her animals.  For this reason, Francisca only has three sheep at her house. There are five at her daughter\u2019s house.  There are no fresh pastures where Francisca lives. There are a few where her daughter lives. Her grandson also takes them out to the pastures in the afternoon. Francisca is very grateful because thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase pasture land. In addition to the land, she can start her small candy shop. Since the start of the loan, she has been saving all of her earnings. With these, she can put money into the shop. Francisca\u2019s goals are to improve her quality of life and to not be so preoccupied about money when she or her husband gets sick and they don\u2019t have money to pay medication expenses. While Francisca will invest in the sheep, Alfredo, Natila, Marcela, Victoria Leticia and Tomasa also will invest in sheep. In general, all the members are very grateful for the granted loan since they can now purchase their little animals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":1081470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase sheep and pastures.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La labor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-05-06T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-05T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":918.75,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":12070.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317582,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":8046.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418967,"comment":null},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8046.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568543,"comment":null},{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4023.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-15T20:18:40Z","paid_date":"2012-09-28T08:17:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421716,"name":"Louie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Louie is 24 years old and married with 2 children.

She was happy to generate income from it for her children's education. She would like to sell more clothes so she is asking for a loan to have additional capital for buying  used clothes, shoes and bags to sell. She needs P15,000. Part of the loan will also be used for buying hog feed for sustenance.\r\n \r\nVilma's goal in life is to keep growing as an entreprenuer in order to give the best education to her two children.

Jamil opened a cafe where he sells Manakish (a special Lebanese dough topped with thyme, cheese or other tasty ingredients, like a folded pizza usually eaten for breakfast). His Manakish are special since the dough is like pita bread which gives it a unique taste. He also sells soft drinks and sweets. \r\n\r\nJamil works as a taxi driver day and night, managing between the two businesses, and he hopes to expand both businesses. Jamil applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Al Majmoua, in order to support his newly established cafe business, because he believes that the more you invest in a certain business, the more it sprouts in the future. Most of his customers are relatives, neighbors and friends. He hopes one day most of the tourists he works with through his taxi business will come and taste his delicious Manakish.
