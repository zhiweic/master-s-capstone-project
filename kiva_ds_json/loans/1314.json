He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 98 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. George has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\n\nGeorge is a reliable member of the community. He is married with four children. George is 39 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 19 years to support his family. In addition to this, George is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. He described his harvest last year as \"good\". He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \n\nGeorge first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. George joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, purchase fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. George plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. George\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.   \n\nGeorge and his group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

He is from the Shahrituz region. Shahrituz is a rural region of Tajikistan that has preseverd its 1000-year old culture and customs.  Bobonazar is a local who respects the culture and traditions of his people. You can see this by the way he is dressed. He is wearing a \u201cjoma\u201d (a traditional men\u2019s robe made of pressed cotton). In villages and hamlets  around Tajikistan, people still wear \u201cjoma\u201d. It protects both from the cold and, in warm weather from the heat.\r\n\r\nBobonazar, like the generations before him, is a farmer. He has learned this work from his father. Bobonazar grows produce. But at present he would like also to raise livestock. This will allow him to earn a bigger income and he will be able to spend the winter usefully.  His funds are insufficient to buy livestock, which is why he is turning to you for help. Please help him!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1514454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle and launch his livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bobonazar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":278},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":276}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":660805,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita earns a living as a dressmaker.

She attended a school in the community up to the 6th grade of basic education as her parents were not able to help her continue with her studies.  Her husband works in handicrafts, weaving hammocks of silk, poly silk and cotton husk fiber.  He also works in agriculture.  Her children are 2 and 6 years old. \r\n\r\nSantos makes a living in handicrafts independently since she got married and formed her own family.  She learned the job earlier thanks to her parents who taught her from the age of eight.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start her own business making hammocks as she had to help support her family and in this way obtain financial income.  She has also worked raising small animals (pigs and poultry).  With these two jobs she struggles every day to get her children ahead as well as her parents as she is always keeping an eye on them.\r\n\r\nShe works every day from six in the morning until various hours in the night so that in this way she can move forward making hammocks.  Her husband helps her after he comes from his work in the fields. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from CrediCampo is for the purchase of wood, sheet metal and tile to improve her house as part of it is in poor condition due to the past winter, part of the wood was damaged and water got into the house which meant she had to leave and go to where her parents are to seek shelter.\r\n\r\nWith these things her house will be a lot more secure as the roof will be in better condition and she will put sheet metal and wood on the walls.\r\n\r\nShe will also purchase 100 pounds of silk thread to make hammocks. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to raise her children and give them the education that she wasn\u2019t able to have so that they can be people who are a benefit to society.  She hopes to obtain greater financial income to be gradually increasing her sales and to give her family a better future. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1516214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase wood, sheet metal and tile to improve her house and 100 pounds of silk thread to make hammocks.

She is blessed with three children: two boys and one girl.\r\n\r\nChichin is engaged in poultry and also grows vegetables at the backyard. She grows vegetables according to seasonal changes and sells them to women vegetable vendors. She can earn regularly throughout the year because the backyard is vast and looks like a little vegetable farm with various vegetables. She purchases seeds and saplings from Imphal town and plants them. She grows cabbage, cauliflower, peas, potatoes, etc. in the farm and sales are going well. She prefers to grow vegetables because she loves taking care of the vegetables and also it is her hobby.\r\n\r\nShe also raises chickens at the backyard and says it is easy for her to do both -- selling vegetables and raising chickens -- because she doesn\u2019t go to the town and sit in the market shed to sell them. Vendors come to her house, get the vegetables and poultry, and take them back to the market for selling.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more chicks for the poultry and also buy winter vegetable seeds and saplings.

He used to work in his own business of producing and selling cold meats, especially sausages.  He worked for 15 years, gaining vast experience and recognition in the area for the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nHowever, some time ago life dealt him a difficult blow when his mother, with whom he lived, passed away.  He entered into a great depression which caused the closure of his business.  He is now in a difficult financial situation.  He is unemployed because of his advanced age.  That is the reason that he wants to reactivate his sausage business.  He wants to take advantage of old customers that still request his product.\r\n\r\nThat is why he is requesting the support of the loan.

five children. She has a high school education and works in animal husbandry as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 30 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 1,000 KGS.

He is 59 years old, and is the owner of a stationery store that he started up 4 years ago, taking advantage of a location in front of an educational institution where there was no nearby competition.  He works every day, and offers all kinds of stationery items for sale.  He also provides photocopy, fax, and scanning services, and sells ladies' accessories.

He is 45 years old and a father of four dependent children, two of whom are in school while the remaining two are too young for schooling. \r\n\r\nTo support the family, he works as a construction worker for a fee, and does rice farming as the main source of income. Having been with the current business for four years, he is able to earn up to 20,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nBesides focusing on his income generating activities, he also wants to pay attention to the sanitation practices in his household. However, he does not have any decent latrine yet, which is quite challenging for him. To overcome this challenge, he formed a group of two to get a first loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). He and his co-borrower are applying for the same loan amount of 177,000 KHR each. \r\n\r\nAs a leader, he will spend his entire loan portion to build a decent latrine for his household. \r\n\r\nHe hopes his family will has good health with better living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1516696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Appliances","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To build a decent latrine for his household","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kandal province, Kandal Stoeng district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2014-01-23T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-22T19:20:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":354000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":24000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.48},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.47},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T19:29:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650809,"name":"Anatolia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anatolia works hard to support her family.

She has three siblings who are in the same situation as she is with their parents. \r\n\r\nAna works raising small animals, poultry and pigs on a small scale. She started four years ago on her own initiative. The business is quite profitable, since she fattens up the pigs and even butchers them to obtain income for her family and her son. She also sells tamales and atol [a traditional sweet drink] in the evenings in her community, with the help of her sister and her mother. \r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy 6 pigs valued at $50 each, and she also needs $100 to buy school supplies for her son and uniforms which he will wear at school. She will invest the rest in buying supplies, such as corn, concentrated animal feed and other items to maintain her pigs. She currently has two piglets; she recently sold two pigs in the community.\r\n\r\nWith this she will ensure that her son can go to the local school, and she will also have her piglets to fatten up, which she will take care of and later sell for a better price and obtain higher returns. \r\n\r\nAna will build a house of her own for her son, where she can continue working independently to give her son a better future. \r\n\r\nWith her small savings, she plans to create a larger enclosure where she can raise and fatten up her pigs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1516240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 6 pigs and animal feed, as well as school supplies and uniforms for her son.

He has a wife and 4 children. \r\n\r\nThe family runs agricultural activities. They have 4 cows, 50 trees of nuts and a plot of agricultural land. Sadly, for lack of economic resources and because he had to start working at a very young age, he was unable to study a professional career. Malkhaz works hard on the family-owned agricultural land, growing nuts and looking after 4 cows, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. They also use the milk products to feed the family. \r\n\r\nAs the family has only a seasonal income, Malkhaz decided to start a firewood business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, that is the joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting a businesses.

Currently, Luis and his family live in the house of Luis\u2019 mother alongside Luis\u2019 brothers.  The house only has 2 rooms, a kitchen and an outdoor latrine.  It is overcrowded. \n\nThey are inhabitants of the municipality of Urique in the northern state of Chihuahua in Mexico, famous because of the Copper Canyon.  The municipality has 2,300 inhabitants, some of whom are Tarahumara Indians, who still live their own culture and speak their own language.\n\nLuis and Juana want to use this loan to build their own home.  They see it as an opportunity they have to offer their children an inheritance - a home where they can feel comfortable, where they can move from the kitchen to the room with all the freedom their own house can give them, improving their quality of life.\n\nLuis Gabriel is a young father and is known as responsible and hard working.  He is a very respectful and sociable young man without vices and he has a very good sense of humor.  Luis Gabriel is a hotel employee and is also a waiter in a community 9km away, where Juana also works as a cook.  Juana is a committed mother and wife - hard working, with a very good temperament. \n\nAt the moment they are completely dedicated to their work.  Together they earn USD 307 a month, and with this money they pay for food, education, health, and clothing.  They also try to save money for the future - especially for housing because they want to own a home.  Luis Gabriel says that they saw a possibility with Habitat to make their dreams come true.  They have completed all the program requirements.  In addition, they are a very active and participative family in all the activities of the community. \n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe and affordable place to live.  Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system.  The families need to participate in workshops and trainings about building, healthy housing, and financial education so they can develop and strengthen their capacities.  Habitat for Humanity has worked in Mexico since 1989 and has served more than 7,000 families just in the last 3 years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1477352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy

The loan will improve his situation, since with the institution he can make monthly payments but he can't with the individuals, and this will help him a lot because he has more time to pay.\r\n\r\nHis dreams for his future are to continue working in agriculture and thus always be able to sustain his family, since they won't lack for food, and with his earnings from his work as a security officer to be able to send his children to school and raise them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1497781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay some debts that he has to other people in the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francis Bladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":68.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.93},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650008,"name":"Marta Adilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marta Adilia habita en la comarca La Palma ubicada a 10 kil\u00f3metros del municipio de El Sauce el cual es un lugar muy agradable que lo caracteriza porque a orillas de la carretera pasa un enorme y caudaloso r\u00edo que sus habitantes lo utilizan para lavar ropa y ba\u00f1arse, aguar el ganado.\nMarta Adilia es una profesora con m\u00e1s de veinte a\u00f1os de experiencia, madre soltera de una hija a su cargo donde agradece a Dios por tener este trabajo digno que le ha permitido sacar adelante a su hija y ayudar a su madre.\nEn este momento est\u00e1 solicitan la ayuda a los inversionistas de Kiva para que a trav\u00e9s de Ceprodel le financien un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de medicamentos y realizaci\u00f3n de ex\u00e1menes de su mam\u00e1 con el fin de mejorar su salud, ya que por la distancia y las condiciones en las que habitan alejado de la ciudad se les hace muy dif\u00edcil estar viajando sobre todo por la edad de su mam\u00e1 y lo costoso del medicamento.\nEspera que estas personas de buen coraz\u00f3n la apoyen en este momento que tanto lo necesita donde lea agradecer\u00e1 por toda su vida.\n","en":"Marta Adila lives in the region of La Palma located 10 kilometres from the town of El Sauce, which is a very nice place characterised by the edge of the highway passing a great river that residents use for washing clothes, bathing and watering down livestock.\r\nMarta Adilia is a teacher with over twenty years experience and mother to a daughter who she looks after.

Dalal is a conservative woman, she asked her husband to take her place in the picture. \r\n\r\nDalal was born in 1981. She is married and lives in a sector in Jordan called Marka with her husband who is running a dry cleaning business. Her husband got his experience from prior work at another dry cleaner.

According with the culture, they have grown their family, as they believe that with more children, they will have more workers and income, and consequently a better life.  \n\nMost of the community works in farming, as there aren't jobs, and they survive with the harvest.  There is little income and when it's not harvest season, the father must work elsewhere and leave the family for several months, often searching for jobs as a baker's assistant or farmhand.  Almost everyone in the community are coffee producers, however the prices they get are very low because of the \u201ccoyotes\u201d (who are the intermediaries, and market the coffee for the producers but in the end keep the majority of profits).\n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit international organization founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.  Habitat for Humanity Mexico works in communities with groups who build through mutual help and a self-construction system.

","en":" Mayra is 39 years old.  She got an elementary school education in the school in her town.  Because her family lacked resources when she was young, she was not able to continue to middle school.  For this reason she started working, selling corn tortillas with a neighbor.  Mayra comes from a hardworking family that instilled in her good moral principles, and with a lot of effort, they have helped her to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nMayra formed a family that includes two children, for whom she works with a lot of sacrifice so that she can give them the best and provide for their needs.  Her children are in the local elementary school.  She plans to help them advance in their studies until they can graduate from college and become professionals.  \r\n\r\nMayra now has her own business selling tortillas.  She has 15 years of experience in this line of work.  She learned the business from her neighbor, with whom she worked for 8 years.  Now she is continuing to work with the help of her younger sister.  Her business is set up in front of her parents' house.  She works Mondays through Saturdays.  \r\n\r\nMayra is requesting a loan from Fundacion Campo to buy corn and to start up a small fireworks business, as we are now near the end of the year.

Through this he will be able to improve his and his family's quality of life a little, with an increase in household income.\r\nRonal hopes soon to grow his business and with this be able to continue supporting his family so that they may have more opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nCholutecta, Honduras - November 2013\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1497795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sugar, rice, beans, water, soft drinks, coffee, bread, milk, eggs, etc. for his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2013-12-25T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ronal Noel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650012,"name":"Ana Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 51 a\u00f1os de edad, es una madre soltera de de un hijo.

She only completed one year of high school, which was not a difficulty for her, because she needed to help her family to get ahead.  Her husband died after suffering for 2 years from natural causes, leaving her with her only child.  It has been for him that she has struggled, so that she could provide for him and so that he could get an education.  \r\n\r\nAna lives alone with her son, who helps her with many things, from household tasks to working in the fields.  In spite of being a very small family, they try to work together so that they can get ahead.  \r\n\r\nAna has a business selling snacks such as cakes, fried cassava, banana tostadas, and her main product, which is bread filled with chicken.  She's had this business for 10 years, and she sells in the center of her town.  She started this business seeing a need to generate income so that she could give her son an education and cover the household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, she now has help from her son, who works in agriculture and as a day worker where he gets an income so that he can help his mother with the household expenses.  Ana sells all week with only 2 days of rest.  She walks from her house to the place where she has set up a stall, and her son helps her with the production of staple grains that she uses to make some of her snacks.  She sells from 2pm until 6pm.  \r\n\r\nAna is requesting a loan to buy the products that she needs to make her snacks, such as bananas, cassava, and the chicken she needs for her stuffed bread.  She will buy these products at wholesale to get a better price.  She hopes that with this loan her business will grow during the Christmas season.  \r\n\r\nAna plans to continue to work as long as God gives her the strength, so that she can help her only child, who hopes to continue to study for a university degree.

Aida has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Aida is involved in animal husbandry, having started 9 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aida's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows and 3 sheep. She is additionally involved in reselling vegetables.  She sells them at a wholesale market and resells to retail customers.  Aida is very diligent because her parents were involved in animal husbandry for a long time and they got Aida to love hard work and animals.  The monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Aida requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount. Aida plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to open a small pavilion for selling vegetables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1514466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep in order to increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-24T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-23T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-24T08:24:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":650015,"name":"Eva Adalgisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Eva de 27 a\u00f1os  de edad es soltera,  vive con sus  dos hermanos y su madre en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, se dedica desde hace un a\u00f1o y medio  al negocio de venta de joyer\u00eda, sus clientes son sus amigas y personas que le conocen.\nDo\u00f1a Eva es una persona trabajadora con deseos de salir adelante vive en la comunidad de San Lorenzo al sur de Honduras,  su negocio lo realiza de forma ambulante.\nDo\u00f1a Eva est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para compra de pulseras, anillos, cremas, perfumes, lociones, carteras, etc.  con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo pretende mejorar sus ingresos y sacar adelante a su familia, es un cliente nuevo que su sue\u00f1o es tener un buen record de pago para seguir trabajando con Prisma y tambi\u00e9n desea este a\u00f1o terminar de construir un cuarto para vivir ella y su pareja.\n\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras -  Diciembre del 2013.\n\n","en":"Eva, 27, is single and lives with her two siblings and her mother in her home.

He is 28 years old.  He has been working as a retailer for almost eight years, selling winter shoes at the local market.  He buys shoes in bulk quantities and resells on a retail basis.  His family helps him to run the business.  He works in any weather and any day of the week because in winter his merchandise is in high demand.
