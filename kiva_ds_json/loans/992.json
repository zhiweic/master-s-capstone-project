She's going to use it to buy a variety of wool for making her garments that are already ordered, and also for the coming end-of-the-year holidays because she has a lot of demand.  Olga's requesting this loan because she needs the money to buy the essential materials for her textiles.  At the end of the year sales increase and consequently, so does her income.  She'll use the profits to continue buying supplies such as wool, buttons, etc. to make garments with pretty designs.  The garments she makes are highly valued for the quality of her work. \r\n\r\nOlga faces challenges in her business such as health problems because she's seated and weaving all day.

He has been running a taxi business since 2008. Darkhan's parents are pensioners and his younger brother is 20 years old. Before the winter, his brother worked as a builder in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. But at the moment, his brother is at home and will not have a job again until next spring. Ariunbold is worried about his brother\u2019s future. He says that working as a builder is not safe, and the salary is not enough to live on if his brother has a family, because of the seasonality of the work.

Demetrio, her partner and the father of their little 7 year old girl, Yuly, is her right arm at work and together they wish to build a house of cement and bricks since they currently live in a wooden house. Celestina came a few years ago from the central part of the country; she made her arrival to the jungle with the desire to better the quality of her life by making a living in the production of agricultural products, being coffee her main ally. Thus for a year she has been carrying out the role of proprietor for her plots, which were inherited from her parents. With the help of Demetrio and the laborers they've been sowing, harvesting and commercializing coffee beans. And even though coffee plants require a lot of attention, their efforts have been well remunerated with the current prize of coffee beans. However, one factor affecting their work are the constant rains and the emergence of certain plagues, which need to be controlled in a timely matter otherwise they end up ruining a large portion of the crops. To apply the proper treatment it is necessary to have workers on hand, as well as environmentally friendly pesticides. Also the abundant purchase of sacks of organic fertilizer will ensure the plants will grow well and be of the quality that is compensated with a good price.      \r\nIn the future, Celestina plans to save enough capital to open a grocery store in the town where she lives. This will generate income during the seasons of constant rain and the months of the year where the workforce is not as required in the fields. This is her third loan and she plans to continue to make her payments on time to later qualify for a bigger loan.

Her activity is selling cosmetics via catalogue of various brands like Esika, Yambal, Avon and L\u2019Bel to people who work in various private and public firms, to acquaintances and to family members.  Because of the great dedication and sacrifice she makes to close her sales she met her goals and Avon made her a group leader and there are several saleswomen under her supervision.  Even so, she is still unable to cover all her household expenses and pay for her children\u2019s schooling which is why she also sells her products in the city of El Alto\u2019s 16 de Julio street market on Thursdays and Sundays.  She is responsible for all family economic and medical expenses and needs the loan to buy merchandise for the end of the year which is when demand is highest.

","en":"Latacunga is the capital of Cotopaxi Province, one of the provinces that is in the mountainous region of Ecuador.  In recent years, Latacunga has developed significantly and is considered to be one of the most important cities in the region thanks to industries that involve cultivating flowers, mining, metallurgy, agri-business, agriculture, and livestock breeding.  Established businesses that generate significant revenue have also converted Latacunga into a commercial city that offers various opportunities to succeed.  Many of the festivals that are conducted in this city retain their purity and are deeply rooted in the historical origins and ancestral traditions of this place.  It is in this interesting city that Jhoana makes her home.  She is 21 years old, married, and finished her high school education.  Her husband Marco, age 25, works at a supermarket in order to support their family.  They have two children, a three-year-old and a five-month-old baby.  Jhoana faced a very difficult situation when she became a mother at a young age.  Her lack of experience caused her a moment of frustration, but it was during this time that her entrepreneurial spirit emerged to the surface.  \n\nTwo years ago, she decided that she also wanted to contribute to the household by providing for the education and the necessities for her family.  She opened a cybercaf\u00e9 with the help of her husband.  Things were difficult at first because Jhoana was fearful of losing her investment, but she learned how to manage the business well so that she could provide a better future for her children.  She spends between six and twelve hours each day at her business while looking after her small children at the same time.  Her business is frequented mostly by elementary and high school students from the neighborhood.  She also thinks that it would be a good idea to sell school supplies to generate more income.  Therefore, she is requesting a loan so that she can acquire these products.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has opened the doors for her to access this loan easily and with total confidence.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1227601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to buy school supplies that she can sell in her cybercaf\u00e9.

So the couple decided to start their business as a team. Since then, they have united their services and been successful, thanks to the growth in the number of cars in their area as well as the good references Jimy carried with him into this business. Liliana is confident that their business will continue growing and with time, will expand in a way that will allow them to build their house and open a branch there. The key in this moment is for Liliana to keep her store well-stocked with all of the equipment necessary for Jimy to continue doing repairs. \r\n\r\nThis is Liliana's fourth loan with MFP. Because of her punctuality, she has earned the bank's trust as a borrower. Liliana is very grateful to the other members of her community bank because they are very optimistic and organized workers.

In order to supplement the family income and before the group came into existence, she did weaving and sold vegetables. Having to take care of the children in addition to the household chores, she found it difficult to continue her weaving and selling vegetables activities.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan and support from her family members, she partitioned and extended their sitting room into a tea hotel. With good faith, she asked her landlord to allow her to construct a fireplace, which is required for a tea stall. Improving steadily in due course, her tea stall has become a common place to entertain for the young and old. She serves tea, puri and a variety of traditional items with many delicacies made from rice grain.\r\n \r\nShe wants a nursing career for her daughters and she wants the boys to choose the military as their career. She plans to enroll her eldest daughter who is now 20 years old, in a reputable nursing school. She also longs to have a home of her own and she, along with her husband, needs to save for a couple of years more to buy a housing plot and build a house.   \r\n   \r\nShe is requesting another loan to renovate her tea stall. She plans to use the loan to stock milk powder, sugar and tea leaves and spend the remainder to increase her stock of charcoal and firewood, both used for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined the group of five like- minded tribal women from Churachanpur, in the state of Manipur, which is in the northeastern part of India and called the group SARON.

They need another loan to increase their inventory as the festival season is approaching.

They guide and help one another to empower themselves in their businesses and help improve their lives. Hence, the \u201csaving life\u201d concept was born. \r\n\r\nThe one with her hand raised is Zaniang and she is the group leader. She is 43 years old and a mother of two daughters and one son. She lives in a rented room with her two children. In 2007, her husband was electrocuted and died. Since then, she has looked after her children alone and shouldered the responsibility of marrying off her eldest daughter and providing an education for the younger siblings. Her main source of income comes from working as a quarry worker. It takes at least five days to quarry sand to sell from the river bed. Life was not very easy for her until she and her friends came together to help one another\r\n.\r\nWith experience from her quarry work and her first loan of INR 5,000, she began to supply sand to contractors undertaking construction work. This was the turning point in her life. In due course, she became known to contractors of varying grades. Apart from the sand, she also supply bricks and cement as required and demanded. She is very happy that her children are attending school and hopes that they will get a white color job for their career. She also plans and wishes that someday soon she will have a house of her own.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to construct a small godown (warehouse) to stock cement. She will use the loan to buy building materials such as tin sheets, planks, nails, and waterproof wallpaper and to pay labor charges. Having said this, she plans to stock and sell cement at all times. She believes that she will do well in her business because of the good will that she already earned among the builders in and around town.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the members are also working very hard to supplement their respective family incomes. With the festival season looming ahead, they need another loan to supplement their stock in their garment sales and charcoal businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy building materials such as tin sheets, planks, nails, and water proof wall paper and to pay labor charges.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zelkhoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manvung","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinglianmoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaniang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T15:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495081,"name":"Noreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Noreen is a 27-year-old married lady.

Juntos viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por lo que sus habitantes aprovechan la oportunidad para ofrecer tours, servicio de hospedaje, alimentaci\u00f3n, deportes naturales como cabalgatas, etc. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos. Aunque fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, ahora el trabajo arduo de sus habitantes ha hecho que inversionistas y comerciantes pongan toda su atenci\u00f3n en este lugar. \nFranklin aprendi\u00f3 desde ni\u00f1o a criar animales, sus padres le ense\u00f1aron con su experiencia y Franklin incursion\u00f3 en este negocio desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, el cuida a los animales y su h\u00e1bitat para luego comercializarlos en el mercado local. En el transcurso de cada d\u00eda Franklin dedica 10 horas a su negocio, otras veces m\u00e1s, pero lo importante es que en estos a\u00f1os de experiencia ha podido sustentar a su familia y tambi\u00e9n aprender m\u00e1s para poder enfrentar la competencia. Ahora ha decidido dar un gran paso de incrementar su negocio, para lo cual ha recurrido a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para que a trav\u00e9s de Kiva le puedan otorgar un pr\u00e9stamo con el que pueda comprar m\u00e1s animales e insumos para el cuidado de \u00e9stos.

He lives with his wife, with whom he has one daughter, Kamila, who is 4 years old. They live together in a rural parish of the city of Quito, the capital province of Ecuador. The parish is called Nanegalito, and is located north-west of the province of Pichincha, which was once home to an indigenous Ecuadorian culture. It is a place full of diverse flora and fauna, and also has rivers and waterfalls, which are sources of crystal clear water, that attract national and foreign tourists alike. For this reason the locals make the most of the opportunity by offering tours, home stays, meals, natural sports like horseback riding, etc. Another source of income generation for the area is livestock, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture with the production of sugar cane, yucca, bamboo, corn, oranges, mandarins and papayas. Artisan work done by hand is also an opportunity for business in this area, in particular things made with natural products, like seeds found in the forest, are in demand.     \r\n\r\nThe local authorities have been concerned with providing adequate facilities for the more than 3,000 people who live here, to be able to have access to basic services. Even though in the past it was an area that was not paid much attention to, now the hard work that the community members have put in has attracted the interest of investors and business people.\r\n\r\nFranklin began learning how to take care of animals when he was a child. His parents taught him with their own experience, and Franklin has been involved in this type of business since he was 10 years old. He takes care of animals and their living space so that he can later sell them in the local market. Each day Franklin dedicates 10 hours to his business, and sometimes more. The most important thing is that during these years he has been able to support his family and he has also been able to continue learning which has allowed him to keep up with the competition. Now he has decided to take a big step in increasing his business, which is why he has turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, so that through Kiva they can grant him a loan, with which he will be able to buy more animals and supplies to be able to take care of them. The increase in income will help Franklin be able to give to his family a better quality of

Having the same economic background, they strive collectively to help one another to have a meaningful life for themselves. They live in Churachanpur in the state of Manipur, which is located in the northeastern part of India.\r\n\r\nThe one with her hand raised is Mawii, a member of Five Amigos. She is 35 years old and a mother of two daughters who are 13 and 7 years old. The younger daughter is suffering from Downs Syndrome and goes to a school arranged for such challenged ones. In 2006, her husband died in a road accident, leaving her to live a widow's life. Since then, she had been engaged in retailing businesses supplying organic and fresh vegetables and selling used clothes on the weekend. Though she may have had hard luck, she is happy that both her daughters go to school to learn. With a \u201cspecial needs\u201d daughter to take care of and the bargaining nature of the market, she could never do well with her vegetable retailing business.\r\n\r\nSo, with her first loan of INR 5,000, she changed her trade to selling army canteen products door to door. Since the products are sanctioned for the army at subsidized rates, the commission rate is higher. She supplies almost any commodity from toiletry products and appliances to consumables. At the initial stage, it took longer to dispose of the stock but now she is not only disposing of her products more quickly. She usually refills her stock two times a month.\r\n    \r\nWhen asked about her dreams and wishes, she got shy and said, \u201cMay my children flourish even if I suffer. I want for them to have a good life\u201d. Her two happy tears in her eyes said it all about her appreciation and gratitude when asked about her feelings for all the people around the world who lend money to help someone like herself.\r\n\r\nShe is doing very well with her business but she wants to own a clothing store, which will lessen the time she has to move around and enable her to be there for her daughters. She needs another loan to increase her supplies such as soap, lotion for winter, saving cream supplies for the barber shop, milk powder, tea leaves, hair gel, toothpaste and the like. She supplies these items in large quantities to the down town shops. Beside the shops, she has customers whom she supplies at their home according to their needs. \r\n \r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are also working very hard to make the day\u2019s ends meet. Out of five members, four are widows struggling to do their best. The activities of the group members include selling vegetable at the market, selling used clothes and running a tea stall. They requested another loan to grow their business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1234314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more soap, lotion, shaving cream milk powder, tea leaves, hair gel, toothpaste, etc to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Biaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholzanem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lianching","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khawli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T16:39:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495104,"name":"Chimera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chimera has been engaged in vegetable selling for four years.

She does all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good harvest. In addition, Liana has a pig. She sells the cheese products, piglets, nuts and maize at the local open market. Liana is a very hardworking woman with rich experience in her work.\r\n\r\nShe requested a credit for expansion of the cattle shed. After the building is expanded, Liana will be able to keep more livestock there. This will enable them to double production and sales of dairy food and the income of the family will significantly increase. With an increased amount of profit, they will be able to repair the house because the existing one is old and uncomfortable. Due to the above mentioned, the living conditions of the family will be improved."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1234479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to expand the cattle shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Zumi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-11-13T23:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-13T23:30:06Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":53.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":64.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":71.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85.03},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":88.54},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":94.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":97.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.07,"local_amount":53.08,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":53.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331181989,"comment":null},{"amount":38.92,"local_amount":64.42,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":64.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339565860,"comment":null},{"amount":40.28,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":66.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347115433,"comment":null},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":72.44,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":72.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355860912,"comment":null},{"amount":43.22,"local_amount":71.54,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":71.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364569719,"comment":null},{"amount":526.74,"local_amount":871.85,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":875.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372968361,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-14T05:22:35Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:09:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":494825,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Olga tiene 53 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada desde hace mucho tiempo con el se\u00f1or Luis, tienen  hijos, pero todos ya mayores que la ayudan con los gastos del d\u00eda a d\u00eda.\nLa se\u00f1ora Olga es comerciante desde hace varios a\u00f1os, tiene un local de venta de frutas, verduras y productos de primera necesidad en su casa.

She is married to Cayo, who is a cook and they have one child, who is now an adult. She lives with her husband in their own house and they provide each other love and company. \r\n\r\nRosa sells food such as breakfasts and fixed meals. She set up her business in a spacious area of the house and there she waits on customers principally at night, however there are occasions that she serves meals in the mornings. Her customers are passersby in the area, neighbors and friends. Fortunately her establishment is very welcoming thanks to the fine seasoning of her meals. She has had this business for nearly five years. She started this adventure with her husband's help thanks to a loan that they obtained. Now they work together and always cordially care for their customers.\r\n\r\nRosa enjoys her business because it enables her to have an income to pay for household expenses since they have had many economic needs due to the low earnings her husband garnered working for a private restaurant. Now, however, she is relieved because they have developed a worthwhile job for him in their own home.\r\n\r\nThis is her 16th loan from MFP. Thus she is grateful to those who have made her access to this funding possible since she will feel more certain of progressing in her business. She is committed to making her payments on time and feels happy and supported by the members of her communal bank.  With the S\/.2,000 requested she will buy supplies and ingredients for her meals and also she will repair her space by buying ceramic tiles and paint for her walls as well as chairs and tables.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1233954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients to prepare meals as well as ceramic tiles and paint, tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":312.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":303.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":330.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":332.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":355.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":365.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.02},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.21,"local_amount":312.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":316.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053841,"comment":null},{"amount":117.43,"local_amount":303.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":306.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188802,"comment":null},{"amount":128.02,"local_amount":330.38,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":334.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572702,"comment":null},{"amount":128.92,"local_amount":332.68,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122368,"comment":null},{"amount":137.6,"local_amount":355.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":359.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868186,"comment":null},{"amount":141.82,"local_amount":365.99,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":370.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T06:05:31Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":495060,"name":"Nyamdorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Borrower Mr. Nyamdorj is married and 34 years old.

is Rose, 41, a resident of Caloocan, Philippines. She is married to Romeo, a construction foreman and is a mother to her children. Together with her husband, she manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Most of them are independent adults now. Thanks to her family\u2019s support, she owns a house made with solid materials.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, an opportunity arose to start a business. She opened a grocery store in the only spacious and inviting room in her house. With time, she decided to start selling chicharr\u00f3n [fried, crunchy meat] on the go as a complement, since it is one of the products that locals consume the most. She considers her business to be a profitable one, because many of her friends and neighbors are loyal customers. Now that the business is experiencing a good period, she wants to buy supplies for her store, as she considers that expanding her business step by step is convenient so that in the future it can become a larger, complete and well-stocked business. One of her goals for the future is to be able to improve her store\u2019s appearance and to add shelves and big showcases.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixteenth credit. In the past, even if she faced some difficulties, she was able to pay back on time. She likes the fact that the communal bank is composed of numerous members, because collective work is comforting for her.

is Doraliza. She previously accessed a 10,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities of fish and vegetables to expand her product inventory. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and in their personal, house hold and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 20,000 PHP loan for her to loan to pay for fish, meat and vegetables supplies she needed in her business. The more fish, meat and vegetables displayed at her stall the better. More items to sell will result in a better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nDoraliza dreams of having more business and hopes to give her family a good life through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1181637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for more varieties of fish needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-14T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-14T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doraliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6667,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":6849.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960324,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":6666,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6848.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095041,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5480.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484191,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036709,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-15T19:20:44Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
