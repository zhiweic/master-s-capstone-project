She has made a living selling cosmetics for 3 years. She started her business with jobs that her co-workers gave her, and with the little she earned she stocked her small cosmetics sales business. That's how she started gaining experience. Her style of work is door to door because her customers put in their orders ahead of time. The advantages that she has are that her customers recommend her to other people and her clientele grows.  \r\n\r\nEva needs the loan that she is applying for to buy new merchandise like lotions, body creams, shampoo, hair conditioners, deodorant, talcum powders, and face creams, among other products.

She is 21 years old, she is married, and she has two children. Her husband makes a living offering short trips.  \r\n\r\nThree years ago Yaneth began selling used clothes based on requests she received from her neighbors.  The challenges she faces are seasonal drops in sales.  She is requesting this loan to invest in more clothes of the current fashions so that she can attract more customers and increase her sales.  \r\n\r\nShe works from 7:00 AM until 4:00 PM.  Her biggest challenge is that when she provides her customers with a line of credit, they don't always pay her back on time.  Her goals are to be successful and to have her own store where she can sell different styles of clothing so she can make a bigger income.  She wants to help her husband with the household expenses and those of her children.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first time Yaneth has asked for a loan from FAMA and she plans to repay her debt punctually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1086462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli, El Paraiso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T07:01:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:16Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":4666.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4763.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850586,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2381.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551455,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2381.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377726,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":4666.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4763.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387872,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T09:07:11Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":422072,"name":"Djantoyerela Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9es majoritairement dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies, les quatre femmes du groupe  DJANTOYERELA  ont  en moyenne 43  ans et 4 enfants.

His other source of income comes from his inheritance of his parent's house, but that is not enough to take care of his family so he went out to take a loan from BRAC.

She is the mother of four children, and lives with her husband and children in Ziekorodougou, a village in the urban area of Sikasso (the third admistrative region of Mali). After trying several types of business activities without success, such as selling traditional fabrics and jewelry, four years ago Aminata launched a business storing and selling cereals (millet, corn, rice etc). She has a lot of experience in this area and enjoys a good business reputation. She receives many orders, but lacks the necessary resources to satisfy all requests. She has been a member of Soro Yiriwaso for three yars. All prior loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWishing to better meet the growing customer demand, she is seeking a new loan, which will allow her to buy five bags of millet and five bags of corn. She stocks up in the villages of Tiongonbougou, Heremakono, and Kolokoba. She stocks cereals in her warehouse in Ziekorodougou. She sells wholesale and retail, for cash, to a customer base composed of both consumers and vendors. With this loan, she plans to achieve an average monthly income of 65,000 West African Francs, which will be used for her personal needs, her family\u2019s needs, and the interest on her loan, and the rest reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1089053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

She carries out her business at a local market, and also sells on the streets of Sikasso where she is much in demand thanks to the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the demands of her growing customer base, Rokiatou decided to join the microfinance institution of Soro Yiriwaso over 4 years ago. She is now on her first individual loan, after 2 group loans requested together with a local woman's association. She plans to use her loan to buy 2 bales of second hand clothing (e.g. t-shirts, children's clothing, sheets and lingerie bodies) of mixed quality. She gets her merchandise locally from wholesalers before reselling it retail.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Rokiatou expects to make a monthly profit of 75 000 francs, which will be used to contribute to the family expenses, pay off the interest on her loans and reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1092526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy second hand clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T07:01:43Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T07:01:43Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25369.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411153,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12684.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449278,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12684.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502967,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12684.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268602,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12684.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498984,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12684.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102957,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63423.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243243,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-06T23:26:29Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":424769,"name":"Issa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 vers 1974 \u00e0 Sikasso, Monsieur   Issa  est mari\u00e9  et vit avec son \u00e9pouse dans une grande famille traditionnelle \u00e9largie au quartier Fama, un des quartiers p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques de la ville de Sikasso ( troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nMonsieur  Issa n\u2019ayant pas eu la chance d\u2019avancer dans les \u00e9tudes,  s\u2019est vite initi\u00e9 au m\u00e9tier de menuiserie  m\u00e9tallique depuis plus de neuf ans, depuis tr\u00e8s jeune.

They know each other through family, marriage and neighborhood ties.\r\n\r\nThese women buy and sell rice, wax and damask fabrics, and various other goods such as tea, pasta etc.  Eager to meet their customers' increasing needs, they have joined Soro Yiriwaso and this is their tenth solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nStanding first from the left in the photo, Awa is an important seller of all grades of \"bazin\" or damask fabrics, in the village of S\u00e8m\u00e8bougou as well as in the surrounding areas.  She is planning to use her loan to buy seven sets of \"bazin\" fabrics, all printed differently.

She also sells as an itinerant retailer in nearby villages, as well as at the market by the S\u00e9gou water tower.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Awa is expecting average monthly profits to reach 70,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in her business and also used to pay her children's school fees and to buy the condiments that her family needs.

They average 44 years of age and 4 children each, and live in Bamanankin, a neighborhood of the commune of Markala, in the S\u00e9gou region (fourth administrative region of Mali).  They know each other through neighborhood ties and through their income-generating activities at the Markala and Siribala markets.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group sell dry fish, dry gombo (okra), millet and firewood.  In order to boost their businesses, they have joined Soro Yiriwaso and this is their second solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nSitting first from the left in the photo, Mariam owns a large shop in Markala in which she stores grains.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to use her loan to buy four sacks of millet from farmers in villages near Markala.  She resells for cash or on credit to a retail customer base which mostly consists of men.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Mariam is expecting average monthly profits to reach 40,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in her business and also used to buy the condiments that her family needs.

One is driven by her son and the other is rented out, but she generates income from both of them.  Bety has been in business for four years and works by herself since her partner engages in other activities.  Her work enables her to make use of her time as she sees fit.  It was not easy for her to start her business because of the doubts and fears that she held, but she slowly gained more strength and now is very good at what she does.  Bety set a goal to expand her store and offer more products to her customers.  \n\nThis will be her 16th loan with MFP.  Bety is pleased to know that she has financial support, which makes her feel more confident about advancing her business.  She promises once again, just like her previous loans, to complete her payments.  Bety also likes working with the other members of her Communal Bank because they are responsible and supportive.  The loan of 1,500 PEN that she requested will be used to buy products for her store.  She will also have her motorcycle taxis sent out for repairs since they have deteriorated as a result of the bad condition of the streets throughout the city.

He is married with children ages 18 and 24. He is a high-school graduate. For the past four years, he has been operating a drugstore.

She uses her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nShe has been using her sewing skills to generate additional income for the family by meeting custom orders for the past 6 years. Galawezh would like to improve her work conditions by renovating the work area, creating a more pleasant atmosphere for both herself and her customers. To do the repair work, Galawezh took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq as a member of a group.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers group loans for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.
