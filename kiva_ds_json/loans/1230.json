a rabbit farmer from Tlaxcala, wants to more effectively use the rabbit waste on his farm.

Eyman is a 29-year-old woman who lives in Sana'a, Yemen. She runs a business selling different types of sweets. Since she had a small business and there wasn't another bakery in the area, she attracted customers by making tasty sweets for them. Eyman not only uses her business as a source of income but also for social purposes, including providing the poor with sweets, especially during festivals and weddings seasons. Recently, Eyman's business has decreased leading to a decline in her profits. She has had to stop providing sweets to poor people because of the current situation facing Yemen.

Janett looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJanett dreams of being more successful in her business and hopes that her child will finish his studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week so that she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group comprises 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1442340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for raw ingredients such as rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T10:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T10:00:08Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5208.35,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5421.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824926,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4166.68,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4337.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478748,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4166.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4337.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439701150,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T13:09:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614146,"name":"Romana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A $1,000 loan is offered to Romana to improve her business.

She is the main provider in her family. For Gulshoda, crop farming (growing potatoes, carrots and wheat) is not only a source of income, but also a favorite pastime. She gladly works in the fields from early in the morning to late at night. She is planning to develop her business, but she does not have the money to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. She is requesting a loan in the amount of 5000 somoni to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. She awaits your kindness.

Tamano decided to start earning money as well. As there is a barn for holding livestock in the backyard of their house, Tamano wants to practice animal husbandry, specifically raising sheep. She thinks that sheep rearing is not overly time-consuming and does not require a lot of effort. It is a very profitable business for those who do it, as lamb meat is always in demand. In order to start her business, Tamano is requesting a loan. She plans to buy 15 sheep every month, and after the course of a month, fatten them up and resell them at the livestock market. Thanks to the loan, she will have her own business with a stabile income, which will allow her to increase her family's budget.

She makes her cash or credit sales at the retail level to a customer base compose essentially of consumers at her home, at the market, and at the surrounding fairs.\r\n\r\nFANTA hopes to make a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA that will be used to help her husband to meet family needs, pay back the loan, and reinvest in the business.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":138.89,"image":{"id":1446910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase gains to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625072,"comment":null},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33567.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-10T16:19:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616886,"name":"Jipe Moyo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Mambehe est une commer\u00e7ante et membre d\u2019une association  d\u2019affaires  \u00abJipe Moyo \u00bb, femme mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e  de 35 ans, m\u00e8re des cinq enfants qui tous \u00e9tudient.

She did not get very much education so she started commercial farming in order to survive and meet her family's needs.

This also motivated her to mobilize her colleagues to form a women's group. This group is very determined to change each member\u2019s life and has succeeded in many developmental projects, but also faces a lot of challenges, which is why they are requesting for a loan for UGX 4,800,000 to help them increase the working capital they have to use for different agricultural projects.

is 45 years old and owns a Zoona mobile money transfer business in Lusaka city center with his wife.  They live in a rented house with their four children and two of his wife\u2019s sisters. \r\n\r\nLaston likes to describe his business as the service of sending and receiving money from one location to another in Zambia.  He started operating the business as a way to provide for his family and empower his wife.  Laston enjoys the business because it is an opportunity for him to serve his community.  He enjoys interacting with all the customers from different walks of life that do business at his outlet.  \r\n\r\nThe reason for Laston\u2019s loan request is his big challenge of having very little working capital to service his customer base.   When customers want to send large amounts of money, he cannot serve them.  It also makes operations difficult because he is always running back and forth to the bank to maintain enough cash to serve customers.  This Kiva loan will enable Laston to more than double his working capital float and in turn, serve more customers.  This will bring his business additional profit as well.  \r\n\r\nLaston\u2019s dream is to take care of his family and educate his children.  He would like his kids to have the education that he never had the opportunity to receive.  Laston believes if he can grow his business this dream will become reality.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1442638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To increase his working capital and allow him to serve customers sending and receiving larger amounts of money at his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laston","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-18T23:31:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614355,"name":"Rachel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rachel is from Helen Village, Larena, Siquijor.

Happily, the women were able to successfully pay back the entire loan. \r\n\r\nThe group is currently composed of 15 members, including six new members. The women are motivated to move forward and they have requested another loan cycle. They are engaged in various commercial activities, such as selling shoes, produce (vegetables, fruit, and tortillas), clothing, and snacks. Another client owns a sawmill. There is even a client who sells products by catalogue! Their ultimate goal is to support their families, send their children to school, and develop their community.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Trust Bank is 25-year-old Gabriela, who is the mother of two children. Gabriela and her husband own the sawmill, which they started about four years ago. With a great deal of time and effort, they were able to grow their business and they have been quite innovative. They have introduced new products to their customers, which have been helpful in expanding their business. Gabriela is eager to receive her second loan with Friendship Bridge, which she will use to purchase additional wood to make more products for the customers. There are four additional employees in their business!\r\n\r\nGabriela, along with all members of the Roca Fuerte Trust Bank, are happy to belong to the Friendship Bridge program and express their great appreciation to Kiva investors. The women meet once a month to make payments and receive training on topics, such as children's rights (with an emphasis on education), women's health, hygiene, nutrition, business administration, savings and indebtedness. These trainings benefit not only the members, but also their families and the community. They look forward to a brighter future as empowered women, eliminating poverty!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2205.17,"image":{"id":1441502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase additional wood to make furniture.

These loans will be most useful in providing working capital for the various businesses of these women including textile production and animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe President of \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d is 25-year-old Ana who has a dynamic personality and a tremendous drive to move forward. She is married with an 8-month-old baby boy. Ana makes handmade traditional textiles, especially the beautiful sashes called \u201cfajas\u201d used by the indigenous women of Guatemala to keep their tubular skirts in place. She also raises animals including chickens, pigs and rabbits. Ana travels by public transport to three different markets outside her community each week to sell her products. She is happy to begin her 3rd loan cycle with Friendship Bridge as it allows her to increase her inventory and increase her income. She will buy raw materials such as yarn and thread as well as some animals and feed for them.\r\n\r\nAna relates that she really enjoys belonging to the Trust Bank and being with many of the women of her community on a monthly basis. During their meetings, which last for about one hour, the women receive training about various topics such as health, nutrition, self-esteem and women\u2019s rights. Ana states that the topic that impacts her the most is business management. In her own words, \u201cI like to go the meetings because I have fun with my colleagues and we share and learn a lot together.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe six women of the \u201cLas Golondrinas\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors for their generosity and confidence in funding their loan. With these funds, the ladies can sustain and grow their businesses, generate an income and support their families. They are especially pleased that they can provide for their children\u2019s educational needs. Armed with their new tools, everyone looks forward to a brighter future for themselves, their families and their town, Santa Lucia La Reforma.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":901.34,"image":{"id":1441549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase raw materials such as yarn and thread, and to buy animals ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Lucia La Reforma, Totonicapan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Everilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":21300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2370.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2338.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855095,"comment":null},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503431,"comment":null},{"amount":300.44,"local_amount":2370.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728415,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T20:04:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614374,"name":"Heleniemar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hardworking mother best describes Heleniemar, 28 years old, residing in Lawis, Municipality of Sindangan, Zamboanga Del Norte, Philippines.

Their children go to high school. \r\n\r\nThey live in the lowest floor of the apartment, and as winter is coming closer, she wants to renovate her home. So she is requesting a loan of 8,000,000 MNT to buy vacuum insulated windows, hardwood floors, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, she wants to repair and insulate her home. \r\n\r\nThe renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal for heating and release less pollutants into the atmosphere.

Durante este tiempo pude mantenerme entre los primeros diez promedios acad\u00e9micos de la carrera. Mis responsabilidades financieras y materiales incluyen la manutenci\u00f3n m\u00eda y de mi se\u00f1ora madre, el pago de un cr\u00e9dito educativo al ICETEX y de otras obligaciones con bancos. \n\nSoy un apasionado por la Historia y por un \u00e1rea de estudio espec\u00edfica: Rusia y Europa centro-oriental.

Adem\u00e1s, recientemente mi trabajo ha dejado de ser estable, lo que crea incertidumbre en mi estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y mis ingresos. Por ello, espero que consideren mi caso y tengan a bien prestarme su apoyo. \n\nCuando regrese a Colombia despu\u00e9s de terminar la maestr\u00eda, tengo el sue\u00f1o de vincularme al sector acad\u00e9mico y a la investigaci\u00f3n, con el prop\u00f3sito de compartir y difundir el conocimiento adquirido y, de esa manera, estrechar lazos de amistad entre ambas regiones.\n","en":"Rodolfo, 38, was born in the capital of Colombia. He worked as the editor of a small online publication on industrial engineering to pay for his college history program. He lives with and financially supports his mother, who is a homemaker. Rodolfo dreams of obtaining a masters in Russian and Central-eastern European studies. The only way he can pay for the language test and the university application to enter the program is to apply for a Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nRodolfo tells his story:\r\n\r\n\"I worked hard to finish my undergraduate program, working and studying at the same time. I was able to support myself during the first ten academic semesters of the program. I was financially and materially responsible for both myself and my mother, my student loan at ICETEX, and other bank loans. I love history, specifically Russian and central-eastern European history. I strongly believe that a country's advancement and progress should include preparing experts not only in fields that generate material wealth\u2014engineering, advanced technology, economics, finance, and others\u2014 but also fields like humanities that promote the intellectual and cultural riches and knowledge of our society as well as others. A solid foundation like the one I hope to achieve and spreading what I learned throughout Colombia could help me contribute to this proposition. I'm certain that I will be studying for my masters in Europe in 2014.  \r\n\r\nKiva is providing a great opportunity to achieve my goal, especially since I don't have much money and lately my job has not been stable. This has made my financial situation and my income uncertain. So I hope you will lend me your support. After I finish the masters and return to Colombia, I hope to work in academia and research so that I can share and spread the knowledge I acquired and create friendships in both countries.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1443498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay application fees for the masters program in Russian and Central European studies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogota D.C.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-10-07T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-06T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2070000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":172500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T13:53:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614471,"name":"Kunthea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kunthea (in the photo) is a weaver, and lives on an island of the Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a musician.

With the profits expected from this loan, he intends to expand his business, so that he can eventually construct a small house for his family. \r\n\r\nParveen hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

She works from 6:00am to 10:00pm daily and is able to make a good profit per month.\r\n\r\nThis will be Veronica's 5th loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. With her previous loans, all of which were paid back successfully, Veronica restocked more food supplies in her mamalishe business (cooking oil, some kilos of sugar, baking flour, maize flour and rice). With the profit earned from  her business, she bought a plot of land and paid some portion of family expenses.  Veronica will use this loan to buy more food supplies to prepare more food.

is a 43-year-old hard-working woman.

To do that, she has requested a loan as a member of an eight-person group from KIVA partner BRAC Pakistan so she can continue her business. With the profits she will pay the household expenses, put aside some savings, pay utility bills and open a new mobile shop for her elder son.

is 30 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past four years, Rita has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells plastic items such as plates, cups and basins. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rita has requested a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more plastic items, such as plates, cups and thermoses, to sell and will help Rita to generate greater profits and take care of her child and herself. Rita hopes that in the future, she will be able to expand the business and add other more different items. \r\n\r\nRita is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Rita who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":248.64,"image":{"id":1443215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more plastic items, such as plates, cups and thermoses, to sell.
