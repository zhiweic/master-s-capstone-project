Ramin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ramin will install the water system in his greenhouse and purchase vegetable seeds and fertilizer. He has already built a greenhouse and now needs to prepare land for harvesting vegetables. The harvested products will be sold at the local markets, and Ramin will earn a good profit for his family.

She completed only the first three years of primary school but is grateful to her parents for supporting her through them.  Bacilia has five children with her husband.  The two oldest are in school, one is in nursery and the other two are too young for any school yet.  Over three years ago, Bacilia''s husband taught her how to grow coffee as it is a source of income for the family.  They sell their product to agents who came to the area and the couple describe their product as being of good quality and clean.  The couple grow the coffee on their own land as it was left to them by Bacilia's husband's parents.

Over the passage of time, she been injecting the store with new items and now it has become popular in the community. She wants to increase her inventory as the population in her neighborhood has increased in the recent years.

He started teaching math at a local middle school and discovered his calling. Eventually he opened a tutoring business that rapidly grew by word of mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cI enjoy teaching,\u201d Chattar said. \u201cAnd the students I had learned a lot with my background and my patience and my teaching style.\u201d\r\n\r\nChattar started teaching at a high school and saw that there was a strong need for one-on-one tutoring in math. So he started tutoring his high school students. Eventually, he used his business training background to start a tutoring business. Originally he called the business MathMobile, because math was his specialty. \r\n\r\n\u201cBut thereafter it just grew,\u201d Chattar said. \u201cThe parents we had started referring us to other clientele and we just grew. And now we have 25 tutors and we just run the business and make sure we hire the right type of people to work as tutors.\u201d\r\n\r\nChattar changed the name of the business to Texas Mobile Tutorials to better reflect the broad range of subjects the company tutors: math, English\/reading, social studies, biology, chemistry, physics, history, test preparation, computer programs, and other topics.\r\n\r\nRecently, Texas Mobile Tutorials became an approved provider under the Texas Education Agency\u2019s Supplemental Educational Services program, enabling Chattar\u2019s company to serve low-income students in schools at risk of failing to meet state education standards. \r\n\r\nThe contract might seem like a boon for Chattar\u2019s tutorial business. But Chattar said he has to pay his tutors and buy the books and other material up front. He is guaranteed payment by the state, but weeks after services have already been delivered. \r\n\r\nSo Chattar applied for a working capital loan with Accion Texas Inc. after learning about the nonprofit organization through the Small Business Administration in El Paso. Using his $5,450 loan to buy materials and to pay tutors immediately after rendering services, Chattar said he was able to pick up 10 students from the state program. \r\n\r\nChattar said he hopes to serve more students through the program as he builds his capital, pays off his loan, and eventually obtains revolving credit for his business.\r\n \r\n\u201cWe would have had to let go of those students if we didn\u2019t get the Accion Texas loan,\u201d Chattar said.

Farmers are happy to sell to I Komang because he pays them directly and they do not need to wait a day or two.\r\n\r\nI Komang is requesting a loan to purchase paddies, coconut, cacao, banana, and other crops. He will collect all this produce with his children and then rent a car to transport his crops to the market.

is 35 years old.

In particular, they have a pig and a hectare plot of land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested vegetables at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBesarion requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Besarion has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Besarion will purchase bee-hives with bee-colonies. They will produce honey for him to sell and will increase the income of the family.

She is able to attract customers to her merchandise.  She has ten years of experience in the retail field and was able to learn all of the nuances of buying and selling merchandise during this time.  Her merchandise consists of shoes - a lot of shoes and galoshes.  According to Nargiza's own words, now is the season for selling summer slippers and she has to update her merchandise often and quickly.  And truly, when coming to her store, one could not look at her merchandise in detail because there were a lot of customers (but it is necessary to point out that not all who looked were buying shoes).  According to Nargiza's words, the secret to such a number of clients and sales is in the prices of her goods.  She brings in shoes and galoshes herself and this is why sells them slightly cheaper than others.  Nargiza does not have a higher education, but handles business affairs perfectly.  She has three loving children.  Her husband helps her with the sales business.  The children attend a school and a university.  Due to the season, Nargiza needs additional money.  She does not want to miss out on the \"golden\" time and brings in merchandise while there is high demand for it, but does not have available funds.  She came to MDO \"Arvand\" for a loan with this goal in mind.  She is grateful in advance for the help and assistance in advancing her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":724.54,"image":{"id":1343015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy seasonal merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-21T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-20T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":103.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":110.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":113.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":119.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":126.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.35},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.32,"local_amount":96.32,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752026,"comment":null},{"amount":98.62,"local_amount":98.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":98.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616113,"comment":null},{"amount":100.98,"local_amount":100.98,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859983,"comment":null},{"amount":103.39,"local_amount":103.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136727,"comment":null},{"amount":105.86,"local_amount":105.86,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900922,"comment":null},{"amount":108.39,"local_amount":108.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550106,"comment":null},{"amount":110.98,"local_amount":110.98,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":110.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774331,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-21T23:43:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":561690,"name":"Sevinc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevinc is 27 years old and the mother of two children.

She is very kind, caring and also very energetic in her work. \r\n\r\nSevinc is growing fruits and vegetables. She plants tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants and other vegetables and fruits. She says even though this business is very hard, together with her husband she has been handling the business for three years without any difficulty. \r\n\r\nSevinc grows vegetables and fruits and sells them in the bazaar. Her income from vegetable and fruit sales is 150 AZN. She has more plans for the future, such as to get more land for cultivation.

is 22 years old. She lives in Kutaisi, West Georgia, with her parents. She works in a local shop as a seller and her monthly salary is the only source of income for her family. Teona  has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to start a family business but her loan requests have always been rejected because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nTeona is requesting a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She will open a business selling clothing and household goods. Teona will go to Turkey to purchase items at wholesale prices and bring them back to her home district to sell at a mark-up to villagers.  Her loan has been approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo.

Such rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. Guram will use the loan amount to purchase a cement-block bottling machine and raw materials.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Almagul is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business nine years ago with a purchase of livestock for 60,000 som.  Thanks to Almagul's persistent work, today her business contains three cattle with offspring, five small livestock, and 1.20 hectares of leased land, where she grows barley and wheat.  In order to further develop her business, Almagul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy cattle and pesticides for treating the land.  She plans to use the earnings from the loan to invest into a further increase of domestic livestock and dreams of growing her business by opening a small food market in the

His aim is to meet his ever-increasing customer demand. The growth of his profits will allow him to start selling cement and also to improve his family's food conditions further.
