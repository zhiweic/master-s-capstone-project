is a 41-year-old married woman and an industrious mother of four children. Two of her children are employed and the other two children are still students. Prak described herself as a humble farmer who is patient in her current business.

She is from a family of five siblings who went to live with their dad. Since she was young, she grew up with an aunt, since her mother emigrated to the United States and left her since she was a child with her aunt. \r\n\r\nA year and a half ago, she started selling clothing (for children, adults, and senior citizens; at the same times she sells undergarments and shoes). She learned this work thanks to her uncle who taught her to safeguard her income and to raise her son, since she lives alone with him. Before she studied in the city, where she finished middle school. Today her business is profitable and from it she obtains economic income to move forward. \r\n\r\nThe clothing that she buys for sale, she acquires in a city and her uncle also brings her clothing and shoes. To go shopping, she accompanies a friend on urban transportation, which is one hour to arrive at the destination. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to purchase 4 dozen pairs of pants, in which she will invest an average of $400; $300 in the purchase of shirts (for men of all ages) and women's blouses and $200 on the purchase of sandals, shoes for all ages; the rest she needs to pay for the trip to the location where she purchases the merchandise. She needs to have the merchandise for the vacation season in the country, since it is a period where there is a big demand for clothing. Now she does not have much to offer customers, and she already has various customers in different communities, and she also goes to sell in the close communities. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to have a well-established business with her own location and to distribute wholesale. In the long term, she plans to buy her own land to make a house for her son and her.

She has now been running her shop for 25 years and offers goods such as: children's, adults' and women's shoes, all types of clothing, plastic goods, fans and crockery, among other things.  Her shop is located in her home and she travels to other places to buy her merchandise for cash and, from time to time, also goes to Managua.  She sells her goods for cash and on credit to regular and casual customers and also travels around in search of new customers.  She will use this loan to invest in her small shop and stock up with merchandise.  One of her dreams is to see her two children study for a professional career and lead fulfilling lives.  Jacinta is seeking the loan to buy general merchandise such as: different types of clothing, plastic goods and shoes, among other things.

Her children were still school-aged and at that time she did not work.\r\n\r\nShushan is educated, she graduated from Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute and at this moment she works at the school as teacher of mathematics. Simultaneously she has another occupation growing and selling flowers. She says that it is a great pleasure to work with flowers, since it relaxes her.\r\n\r\nShushan\u2019s sons are also engaged in this work and they do it with the same pleasure and enthusiasm as their mother does.\r\n\r\nShe has taken eleven loans from Nor Horizon and this time she wants to have a deal with Kiva and she has asked for a loan to buy seedlings and fertilizers for her greenhouse which will help to enrich the assortment of flowers and allow her to have more profit.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nEstelita's dream is to run her business very well, and she hopes that her family will always be in good health. She meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from her religion. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners who gather each week to study religion, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1389794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for groceries, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-18T15:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-17T15:00:19Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2169.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534975,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2892.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784375,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2892.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771361,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2892.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824408,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T15:53:57Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":583893,"name":"Haydar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haydar is from Iraq.

Algo muy caracter\u00edstico de la comunidad donde se ubica el grupo es su pastizal muy verde y los hermosos paisajes de cerros muy frondosos.

They have known each other for a number of years and during this time they have built up a close and sincere friendship.  They live in a Mazahua community where some people still communicate in their native language.  Nowadays very few women still wear the typical local dress which is characterised by very bright colours.  Something very characteristic of the community where the group is based is its very green pasture land and the beautiful scenery of wooded hills.  \r\n\r\nAdriana, who is 26, is one member of the group.  She was only educated to secondary level and is known for being very cheerful and always in a good mood.  She lives with Angel, who works as a bricklayer, and together they have built a family of five children, two of who are still in education.  Adriana has had a grocery shop for 4 years now.  She is seeking a loan to buy more groceries such as bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, tinned goods etc.  Adriana says that she set up the grocery shop because where she lives there was no shop to buy anything.  She says that the loan has enabled her to keep her grocery shop going; she always tries to stock a bit of everything so as to keep her customers happy.  Her shop is doing very well and she makes good profits as she makes sales every day.  Her only problem is the fact that she has no fridge because her previous one broke down, meaning that she will not be able to sell soft drinks or dairy products for a while.  She will now have to save up to pay for the fridge to be repaired.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulbubu has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for ten years, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work and patience, today her business contains two dairy cows and six sheep, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).   In order to further develop her business and increase livestock headcount, Gulbubu requested a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy small livestock.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued development of her business and also wants to improve the family's financial wellbeing.

With the loan of GHS 1500 she'll purchase more plastic products, plates, cups, and cooking utensils and therefore she'll be able to improve her earnings.\r\n \r\nThe group is grateful to Kiva for the extension of help to 'Yehowa Akwe'.

They average 39 years of age, are married and have on average two children each.\r\n\r\nThis group of women trade in a variety of products such as clothing, restauration and others. In order to expand their businesses, the members decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program and are on their fourth group loan.\r\n\r\nTata, who is standing third from the right on the photo, is planning to use her loan to buy chickens, mutton and beef to make up into meals and sell. She gets her food from the Grand Market and sells on a retail basis and for cash from her home, which lies opposite the market, to a diverse customer base.\r\n\r\nTata expects to make 180,000FCFA during the season. As well as repaying their loans, the women use part of their income to cover personal expenses and expand their businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1390797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for restauration business.

She annually works on 0.45 hectares of land and grows corn.  The children help with the business.  Her husband works in Russia.  To-date, thanks to her persistence and drive, Nasipkan developed a small business, containing five sheep, one dairy cow, one calf and six goats.  Nasipkan wants to continue increasing the livestock headcount and, for this purpose, requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cattle.  Nasipkan is part of the \"MOL\" group that has two more participants besides her.

He lives with his wife and three children who go to the local school. The only income source for the family is their small monthly social assistance from the local government institutions, as they belong to the subsistence poor category and live in poverty. \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough to make ends meet for a five-member family, Peliks decided to start a trading business with a loan but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers.  Peliks\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as he didn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nPeliks received this credit in the framework of  a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the so-called Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.

So she decided to start a business trading used clothing with a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from borrowers. Maia\u2019s credit requests were rejected several times, as she doesn\u2019t satisfy their requirements. She has received credit in the framework of a joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, the \u201cStartup Program,\u201d which gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses. With the loan of $1500, she will purchase used clothing and renovate a space where she is going to open a used clothing shop. She plans to sell a wide assortment of well-priced clothing for men, women and children. It is obvious that the job is hard for Maia, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and gradually develop her trading business. The Start Up credit will be a great support for her, as her income will be significantly increased because of Kiva Lenders.

","en":"Ibrohim is a cheerful and open-hearted person.  He tries to get the most amount of good from every situation.  He is married but doesn't have any children.  Ibrohim studied from a baker how to make flatbread.  He knows all the ins and outs of his profession and is a very experienced baker.  He bakes from his own home where he has the national oven, the tandoor.  He sells his good at a local market where he has his own clients.  This has been his profession for more than six years.

He is married and has five children.  All his kids are already grown and they have their own families.  Abdukodir lives with his wife in a small home in a rural village.  Despite his age, he is full of energy and the desire to work to support his family.  He is a farmer and works with livestock.  He has a plot of land which is about 12 hectares.  Of that, about eight hectares are rain fed and the rest is irrigated.  On this land, he grows carrots, potatoes and grains.  His wife helps him care for and raise the animals.  Since they have a lot of land, he also has his cattle graze on it.  Because the livestock business brings in a good income, Abdukodir wants to expand it and increase his herd.  For this, he turned to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle.  Abdukodir is grateful in advance for the support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1386908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-07-18T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-17T22:00:07Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdukodir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":168.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":172.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":176.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":180.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":184.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":188.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":192.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":197.24},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":201.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":206.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":211.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":221.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.13},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.76},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T22:04:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":583988,"name":"Harb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harb is a 36-year-old married father of two children, living in a small village in southern Lebanon.

With the loan of $4000, he will purchase second-hand cars, which are amortized and not in use and start selling the spare parts. He has already rented a commercial space, where he is going to open his auto spare parts shop and make additional income. This credit will be a great support for the family. Leri is thankful to Kiva Lenders for giving him a chance to increase their income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1372.04,"image":{"id":1389983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to begin selling auto spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-18T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-17T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":220.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":221.7},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":225.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":231.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":233.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":239.45},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":242.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":246.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":255.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":264.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":269.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":273.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":278.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":283.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.09},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.61},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.45},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.32},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.54},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":441.79,"local_amount":441.79,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":441.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857576,"comment":null},{"amount":225.61,"local_amount":225.61,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":225.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134225,"comment":null},{"amount":231.5,"local_amount":231.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":231.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107808,"comment":null},{"amount":233.69,"local_amount":233.69,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":233.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255344,"comment":null},{"amount":239.45,"local_amount":239.45,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":239.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T22:25:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":584000,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 36 years old and lives in the West Point area which has the most populated market in Montserrado County.

There is a vacancy for drivers, but owning a car is a necessary condition for this position. \r\n<p>\r\nMirian applied for a 2300 USD loan through Credo.
