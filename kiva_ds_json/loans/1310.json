Inside her home she has the typical responsibilities of a young wife and mother, and she enjoys doing an extra activity through which she can provide services to other women. \r\n\r\nTo make her work easier to manage, Fatin is taking a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq to buy a new sewing machine and a small generator. Because she lives in an area where electricity is scarce and the power supply is often interrupted, having her own generator will enable her to effectively manage her time and plan her work without having to rely on the power supply.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby rendering them ineligible to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for her protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1495177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a new sewing machine and a small generator.

She is 53 years old and is married with five children, three of whom are in college. \r\n\r\nThe loan from Kiva will enable Eunice to acquire hybrid seeds and fertilizer, which will enable her to obtain high yields. Just like other members of her group, Eunice will take input loans for one acre. She plans to grow maize on \u00bd acre and sorghum and millet on \u00bc acre each. \r\n\r\nEunice plans to sell the surplus and join a savings and loaning scheme, so she will save some of the money obtained from selling the surplus. She will then obtain a loan to invest in a business and contribute to paying school fees for her children in college.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1480987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T17:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T17:50:18Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T01:45:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659796,"name":"Abdallah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdallah is a permanent resident of Ndeijja in Mbarara district.

avid artist by trade, Lanita discovered her passion for photography while earning her Associate\u2019s degree at San Diego City College. While walking to class every morning, Lanita began to appreciate the unique artistic value of the eucalyptus trees that populate the area. Using her 35mm camera, she started shooting photos and was surprised at the quality of her shots. Encouraged by friends and family, she found a local printer to print her photos on high-quality photo paper at low cost, and mounted her photos on professional matting. \r\n\r\nShe began selling her photos at local farmers\u2019 markets and art expos and again was surprised by the interest customers had in her work. Unsure of how to officially start up her fledgling business, she turned to local microlender Accion for help.  She signed up for the Accion Academy for Entrepreneurial Success, an eight-week course that teaches students the essentials of starting a business. Upon graduation, students had an opportunity to receive a Kiva loan for up to $5,000 to get their business started.\r\n\r\nGoing through the program, Lanita gained the valuable insight and encouragement needed to turn her hobby into a full-blown business. She is more determined than ever to sell her artwork and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn addition to paying for printing and material costs, Lanita\u2019s $1,500 Kiva loan will enable her to build a website to host her pieces for sale online. She hopes that her business will allow her to one day purchase a home for her family.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Lanita is open to expanding into other media in which she has experience, including sculpture, drawing and painting. \r\n\r\n\u201cI get tremendous satisfaction from my art,\u201d she says. \u201cArt is very fulfilling personally.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1495785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to pay for printing and material costs and to build a website.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Diego","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T18:41:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T18:41:18Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lanita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":76.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":81.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":85.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":86.74},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.74},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.09},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-23T22:29:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648962,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of this group have asked to remain anonymous but are ready to share their stories with Kiva.

It has been difficult to keep deadlines and work as she would have liked to due to the frequent power cuts and interruptions to the quality of the electricity. These unplanned and unforeseen interruptions have the general tendency to come at the worst time, putting orders and all work on hold. To avoid this she would like to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine. To be able to make these purchases she took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1495188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a small generator and a new sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IQ","country":"Iraq","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33 44","type":"point"}},"partner_id":216,"posted_date":"2013-12-22T18:41:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T18:41:18Z","loan_amount":6000,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanaa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haidar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":6000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":648968,"name":"Risper","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Risper lives in Sindo, a small town in Homa Bay County.

They have two children; the older one is going to university this year, and the younger one is still in elementary school. \r\n\r\nPatimah owns several businesses, such as running an internet cafe called \"Warung Internet\" (or \"WarNet\" for short), offering household items on installment, selling mobile phone airtime credits, and processing bill payments for her customers. She joined Ruma because she wants to gain more business knowledge, and earn more income. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Patimah is taking a working capital loan from Kiva as she sees more sales are generated on weekends. For the last three months, she has had around $30-$31 in sales per day, just from selling mobile phone airtime credits.

is a 50-year-old married woman and a mother of four children.

She crops different vegetables and fruits and sells them in the local market. Her son also assists her in growing various crops by watering soil for good quality production. She has gradually improved her business with the support of Kashf Foundation. Currently she is in her 5th loan cycle and has applied for a loan of 40,000 PKR.

She and her husband are bringing up three children. Ozada has secondary education;  from an early age on, she has been raising livestock. She has plenty of experience in animal farming. Her business brings in a stable income. Her husband and children help her in the business. Raising livestock is the main source of income for Ozada's family. She launched this business 30 years ago by buying animals for 1,000 KGS. Thanks to Ozada's hard work, her farm now includes two dairy cows and 15 sheep. Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.

in Odisha, India. She is a very active and confident woman of 49 years. She resides in a small house with her only son and daughter-in-law. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, as head of her family Radhika with confidence took on the responsibility of managing the family and started  running a general grocery shop in her small house with items like soap, shampoo, washing powder, sugar, tea, oil, etc. She started the business with a small investment of her own. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR and it was very difficult on her part to maintain the family with a small income. \r\n\r\nWhen Mahashakti started work in the area, Radhika motivated three other members of her village and formed a Joint Liability Group named Maa Patkhanda to access loans for the development of her business. Her son helped her by purchasing inventory from nearest market, six kilometers away. To date, Radhika has already accessed two loans of 10,000 and 14,000 INR and has been able to expand her business. With her increased income she also constructed a permanent stall adjoining to her house for her general store. Presently she is earning a monthly income of 5,000 INR. \r\n\r\nRadhika says this income is also not enough to make her dream of building a house for her family a reality. She wants to expand her business further, so she will utilize the present loan for purchasing items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. She hopes that this investment will give her more income and with enough savings, she will be able to construct a house for her family. The other three members of the group are Basanti, Jamuna and Mukta who are running a general store, a Tiffin (tea) stall and an electrical repair center.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1515286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, soap, potatoes, etc. for her general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"RISIGAON, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2014-01-21T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-20T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Radhika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T22:32:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":659898,"name":"Maa Tarini Shg (G) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Maa Tarini SHG\" is a self help group of eleven members from a small village of Odisha, India with Laxmi being selected to act as the Kiva representative.

","en":"Abdukholik is a 20 year-old young man, living in the city of Isfara.  He is single and lives with his father, grandfather and brothers.  Abdukholik is short and looks younger than he actually is.  Abdukholik started his own business after finishing school.  He got involved in animal husbandry and has been in this business for two years now.  He likes to raise cows and bulls out in nature.

Two of her older children are college students, and two younger are school students.  Elmira has a higher education.  She graduated from a university with the profession of a physics teacher.  At the present time, she works as a teacher at the local village school.  She has an analytic mind.  Unfortunately, her salary is not enough for consumer and family needs.  To provide additional income for her family, Elmira is involved in animal husbandry, having started 21 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Elmira's hard work, today her business contains 4 dairy cows, 4 horses and 25 sheep.  Her husband also works as a school teacher and helps Elmira with the business in his free time.

Her parents and brother live together with her. The only income for the family is her father's war veterans' pension of 122 GEL. The family belongs to the subsistence poor category, as they have no source of income and live in under the poverty level. As a result of  the above mentioned situation,Tekla lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business, as they require stable income and business experience. The Start Up program created by Kiva and Credo enabled Tekla to get a loan of $3,000 to start a trading business.  She will purchase stock such as snacks, chewing gums, soft drinks and other food products. She has already rented a place where the store will be located.
