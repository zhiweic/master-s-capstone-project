","en":"Sanobar is 49 years old.  She is married and raising three children.  She had been dreaming of becoming a teacher since childhood.  Her family was big and not financially well-off, and this is why she did not have an opportunity to go to a university and get a higher education.  She got married and had children.  She got accepted to a university several years later.  At that time, she already had two children.  She completed the university studies with difficulty and a lot of effort and now works as a teacher at her district's secondary school.  She lives with her husband and three children with her husband's parents.  The children grew up and need a separate house.  The family purchased a land plot this year, but does not have money to buy construction materials, such as cement, bricks, sand, etc.  Sanobar is requesting a loan in the amount of 4000 somoni.

Do\u00f1a Lety tiene una tienda de abarrotes y un molino para moler el nixtamal (Ma\u00edz para hacer tortillas) desde hace ya dos a\u00f1os, Lety comenta \u201cMi motivaci\u00f3n por iniciar mis negocio fue porque el lugar donde vivimos no hay una tienda ni un molino cerca para poder encontrar estos servicios yo y mis vecinos ten\u00edamos que caminar varios kil\u00f3metros\u201d. Esta ella vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar m\u00e1s productos de abarrotes como sal, az\u00facar, pan, huevo, leche, refrescos, productos enlatados etc. En sus negocios le va muy bien porque como no hay ninguna tienda que le haga la competencia es por es que sus ganancias son muy buenas. Sin embrago est\u00e1 preocupada porque no tiene un refrigerador donde pueda guardar sus productos l\u00e1cteos, cuando llega a comprar y no lo puede vender tan r\u00e1pido muchas veces se le caduca para Lety estas son perdidas de ganancias e inversi\u00f3n, sin embrago esa situaci\u00f3n no detiene a Lety para querer llegar a tener una papeler\u00eda porque igualmente no hay una papeler\u00eda cercana donde ella vive, los ni\u00f1os tiene que caminar varios minutos para poder adquirir los materiales para sus clases. Lety platica \u201cEstoy muy contenta y agradecida con VisionFund y KIVA por todo el apoyo recibido porque gracias  a los cr\u00e9ditos he podido mantener mis dos negocios, en mis ganancias me va muy bien lo cual me ayudan a mejorar la calidad de vida de mis ni\u00f1os para mi es muy importante que terminen una carrera profesional\u201d.

They all live in the same community and have known each other for several years. In this community, people still preserve their mother tongue: the Mazahua. Most women still wear their very colorful garments. The most celebrated party is community day, also called \"The Lord of the Miracles\", and is held September 14\r\n\r\nLety, as she is affectionately called, is a member of the group and is a very devoted to her family, but also very hardworking. She was only able to study until high school. She is 30-years-old and is married to Alberto who works as a mason. They have been married for 12 years and have formed a family with five children, four of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nLety has had a grocery store and a mill to grind the boiled corn (maize to make tortillas) for two years. Lety says, \"My motivation for starting my business was because where we live there was not a store or a mill close by. To find these services me and my neighbors had to walk several kilometers.\" \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting a loan to buy more grocery products like salt, sugar, bread, eggs, milk, soft drinks, canned goods etc. Her business is doing very well because as there is not another store that creates competition and for this reason her earnings are very good. However, she is worried because she does not have a refrigerator where she can keep her dairy products. When it comes to buying sometimes she cannot sell fast enough before the goods expire. For Lety these are lost profits and investments.  Either way this situation does not stop Lety who wants to have a c a stationery store because there is also not a stationery store near where she lives. The children have to walk several minutes to get materials for their classes.

He is a Palestinian refugee, living in a Palestinian camp in the South of Lebanon. Palestinians in Lebanon are a marginalized segment of the population since they are restricted to a specific range of low-income jobs, and are often discriminated against. Furthermore, because of the dire situation of Palestinians in Lebanon, Jaber did not receive an education when he was a child, which is why he is illiterate, a great handicap in his life. However, trying to overcome these difficulties, Jaber became a fisherman. Later on he discovered that his revenue did not suffice to provide for a family of six members, which is why he also decided to work in the field of selling furniture.

This loan will be used to buy basic products such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, dairy products, salt, medicines, toilet paper, Tang products, meat, chicken, fizzy drinks, Cola, bread, sweet bread and more.  One thing that Mirna has managed as a result of previous loans is that she has built a wall around her home, providing her family with more security.  Martiza is 40 years old and has a business selling Avon cosmetics.  Eugenia is 21 years old and sells \"posol\" (a maize drink) and seeds for calabash tress.  Margot is 62 years old and has a business selling watermelons.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1387027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy basic products such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, dairy products, salt, medicines, toilet paper, Tang products, meat, chicken, fizzy drinks, Cola, bread, sweet bread and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2013-07-17T09:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-16T09:50:06Z","loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margot Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maritza Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":58300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3643.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581892,"name":"Yojana De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yojana es una mujer emprendedora de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, con tres hijos  de 18, 14 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad.

Desde hace 5 a\u00f1os se dedica a la reparaci\u00f3n de motos y bicicletas; ya que nunca tubo la ayuda de su padre y a sido su madre quien se encargo de criarlo toda la vida.   El  oficio lo aprendi\u00f3 de manera emp\u00edrica, ya que cerca de donde el viv\u00eda, estaba ubicado un peque\u00f1o taller, y todas las tardes llegaba a observar como era que realizaban las labores de trabajo. De esta manera al ver la insistencia  que el muchacho tenia, cierto d\u00eda le dieron la oportunidad de dejarlo laborar en el taller. as\u00ed  fue como aprendi\u00f3 y hace dos a\u00f1os coloco su propio taller, donde actualmente labora.  Con los pocos ingresos que obtiene compra los materiales en la ciudad, en una tienda reconocida en ventas al por mayor de repuestos y herramientas.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar llantas de bicicletas y de moto, porque no tiene disponible para sus clientes solo las repara peor no teine a la venta para cambiarlas,  rines, quiere vender chasis de bicicletas de esto no vende en este momento. De esta manera,   mejorara y equipara su peque\u00f1o negocio.

David espera atraer muchos mas clientes con los que cuenta actualmente, y as\u00ed generar una mayor cantidad de ingresos, con los cuales espera darle una mejor calidad de vida a sus hijos.\n\nLos planes de David  es primeramente cancelar el pr\u00e9stamo y seguir teniendo la oportunidad de nuevos prestamos en la instituci\u00f3n. Otro es darle a sus hijos la oportunidad de estudiar una carrera universitaria, ya que el nunca tubo esa posibilidad, debido a que no tubo la ayuda de su padre. Y desea poder ver  crecer su negocio. \n\n","en":"David is a tenacious young man, 21 years old, with a partner and two children. For 5 years he has been repairing motorcycles and bicycles. He never had the help of his father, and it was his mother who raised him all his life. He learned the trade empirically, as near where he lived there was a small workshop, and every afternoon he went to watch how the work was done. Seeing the boy's persistence, one day they gave him the opportunity to work in the shop. This is how he learned, and two years ago he started his own workshop, where he now works. With the little income he earns, he buys materials in the city, at a shop known for wholesale parts and tools. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase bicycle and motorcycle tires, because he does not have them available for his clients; he repairs them but does not have them for sale to be able to change them. He will also buy rims. He would like to sell bicycle frames, which he does not sell at the moment. This way, he will improve and equip his small business. What he wants is to be able to provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\nOnce his business conditions improve he will invest in the purchase of better quality replacement parts. David hopes to attract many more clients through those he currently has, and thus generate more income, with which he hopes to provide a better quality of life for his children. \r\n\r\nDavid's plan is first to pay off the loan and continue to have the opportunity for new loans with the institution. Another is to give his children the chance to get a university degree, since he never had that chance, due to the lack of assistance from his father. He would also like to see his business grow.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":248.73,"image":{"id":1390109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle

The women chose this name because they love flowers, which grow in abundance in many parts of Guatemala. The population of this area works in agriculture and grows corn, beans, vegetables, and coffee. They also produce handicrafts, like candles and woven cotton items.\r\n\r\nMaria Calixta, a 24-year-old, single mother of a four-year-old boy, is a member of the Trust Bank. She understands that it is never too late to seek personal and professional improvement. Because her son has not begun his own education, Maria Calixta is enrolled in her very first year of school which she attends over the weekends. She is most excited about what she is learning and has the motivation to learn as much as possible, especially learning to read and write in Spanish. She is doing this, so that she can be well-prepared to help her own son when he begins his education. She is hopeful for a better future for his generation.\r\n\r\nLike many in her village, Maria Calixta works in the production of handicrafts, producing napkins, placemats, tablerunners, and caps, which she sells in Santo Domingo Xenacoj and in neighboring markets.

is a dedicated farmer who plants rice on a farm of four hectares. He depends on hiring farming equipment from others, which is very costly and limits the possibilities to fully utilize his four hectares of farmland. The income from the current farming activities is not enough to sustain his family. To make ends meet, Bharat needs to do part-time fishery work. He also works as a part-time domestic servant.\r\n\r\nDue to these circumstances, Bharat would like to purchase a secondhand tractor with attached equipment: a Massey Ferguson 185 2WD. With this tractor he will be able to utilize all of the farmland for rice cultivation and will even use the tractor to prepare the ground of other farmers, resulting in additional income.

She finished high school and has had her own business since 2007 when she started it with 25,000 KGS.  She mostly sells food products at a rural market.  She receives additional income from a bit of livestock, she owns one dairy cow, and one calf.  Her husband and children actively help her with the business.  Thanks to her hard work and optimism, Gulmira has a monthly income from her business of around 8,000 KGS.  Her profits have allowed her to increase her turn over and, in turn, improve her family's well-being.  With the goal of further developing her business, Gulmira has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy food goods to resale.  She plans to use the income from the loan to reinvest in inventory as well as to improve her family's circumstances.

She has a degree and works in a rural school as a teacher of primary classes.  In the year 2000, she was searching for a source of additional income for her family and began working with livestock.  She started this business with 20,000 KGS.  Thanks to her tireless efforts as well as the help and support of her husband, she has seen good results from her business.  Her monthly income is around 5,000 KGS.  Today, she has in her care two dairy cows, two calves and one horse.  Her profits have allowed Syinat to breed her livestock thus improving her family's well-being.  With the goal of further increasing her herd, Syinat has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cows.  She plans on reinvesting the income from the loan to procure more animals.  In the future, she also wants to give her children a worthy education.

","en":"Ehson is a very energetic and fun guy.  He doesn't like to sit on his hands and always finds something to be doing.  He is not married but he hopes to be lucky this year and find himself a suitable candidate to wed.  He works at one organization, but his pay there isn't enough.  So he and his father rent land where they grow various crops.  Ehson loves and cherishes his parents, and tries to do for them all so they don't want for anything.  Ehson's mother has wanted to make repairs to their home for some time but she's been unable to.  Ehson wants to help his parents make the repairs on their home since they are no longer young and don't have the strength for such a task any longer.  He wants to take responsibility for the project and feels that children should always help their parents.  Ehson has some savings, but not enough.  For this reason, he has turned to Arvand for a loan.  Ehson will use the funds to buy building materials.  He very much wants to make his mother's dream come true and relies on Arvand's
