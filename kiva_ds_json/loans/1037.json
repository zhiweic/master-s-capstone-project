Emzar has a large family: wife, parents, two sons, daughter-in-law, and an infant granddaughter. His parents are provided with a retirement pension. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have four milk cows and two calves, whose milk is used in cheese production. They sell cheese locally in an open market at a good price. In addition, they have two pigs and sell piglets. Emzar also has agricultural land where he grows 200 nut trees. He sells approximately 300 kg of nuts seasonally.

They use the milk to produce traditional Georgian cheese and sell it at the local open market. In addition, they have a small pig-breeding farm with one pig and several piglets. They sell the piglets to a wholesaler. Along with these activities, the family has a plot of land where it grows green vegetables. Madona has requested a loan to expand her cattle shed so she can increase the size of her herd and have a place for her animals to stay. The cheese produced by Madona is high quality and in demand in the local market. According to her estimation, when she has more cows she won\u2019t have any problems selling the increased amount of the cheese they produce.

Besides that, they have a pig and 30 hens. \r\n\r\nPikria sells cheese, piglets and eggs locally in an open market at a good price. She is a very hard-working woman and has a rich experience in her business. She requested a loan to buy and sell fruit and vegetables.

Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on the table of every family in Azerbaijan, and they are also used to make fresh fruit punch. Abil usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 130 AZN.\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Abil wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to meet the demand.

Because of her hard work, Turdukan's farm now has three cows, ten sheep and three goats. In order to further expand her business, Turdukan approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 36,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle, which will allow her to increase her profits from resale.

In 2002, to make money for her family Lilia began her business tailoring hats.  Despite the fact that Lilia's degree is in teaching, she found herself in business. At home she makes hats for men and women. She sells her goods in a space she leases in the biggest market in Kyrgyzstan, called \"Dordoi\". She started her business with 15,000 som (KGS). She had been making has for friends and as special orders.  Today, her business generates about 15,000 (KGS) -20,000 (KGS) per month from selling the hats she makes herself. In order to further expand her business, Lilia approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy materials used for sewing because there is a seasonal lull in the market, and prices for raw materials have declined. When the season begins again, Lilia's sales will increase which will increase her income. Lily plans to invest her profits into further expanding her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1276238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy materials to make hats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek city","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-01-15T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-14T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458902,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631572,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743696,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776985,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-15T21:01:53Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517632,"name":"Alix Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alix de 37 a\u00f1os, se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n de bolsos femeninos y art\u00edculos de lencer\u00eda en general, en un taller ubicado en su propia casa, donde habita con su c\u00f3nyuge y sus tres hijos en las edades de 4 a 16 a\u00f1os.

por la falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos, y luego enfrentar el gran reto de apoyar a su madre que por la edad que tiene ya no puede trabajar ni autosustentarse sus necesidades. Esta humilde mujer vive con su madre en la parroquia Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n en Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Adem\u00e1s la visita de turistas nacionales y extranjeros aporta al fortalecimiento de las actividades de los emprendedores que desde hace algunos a\u00f1os han establecido sus negocios alrededor de toda la ciudad. Esta ciudad que es la tercera m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura. \nOleica ha realizado varias actividades en el transcurso de su vida, hace 3 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con la actividad de vender cosm\u00e9ticos de forma ambulante visitando y brindando asesor\u00eda de belleza a sus clientes que en su mayor\u00eda mujeres, demandan mucho los productos que Oleica ofrece. En las ma\u00f1anas y en las tardes Oleica recorre las largas calles de su ciudad para poder vender sus productos sin dejar de lado el cuidado de su madre ni los quehaceres del hogar. Anteriormente Oleica ha solicitado cr\u00e9ditos para incrementar sus ganancias mediante el surtido de sus productos, pero no ha tenido suerte en sus aplicaciones. Ahora lleg\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde sin mucho obst\u00e1culo le brindaron la confianza para realizar un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 productos con ofertas convenientes para que ella pueda ofrecer a sus clientes precios y beneficios competitivos y adem\u00e1s incrementar sus ingresos para cubrir gastos de su hogar y llevar un mejor estilo de vida en donde a ella ni a su madre les falte lo necesario para llevar una vida saludable y estable. ","en":"\r\nOleica is a 36-year-old woman who has gone through significant obstacles in life.  One of them was being unable to complete her education for lack of economic resources and then having to face the challenge of caring for her mother who due to her age is unable to neither work any longer nor support herself.  This humble woman lives with her mother in Abrahan Calazac\u00f3n Parish in Santo Domingo, the capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a place that\u2019s very commercially active because it\u2019s become the land port for exchange between Ecuador\u2019s coastal and mountain regions.  Also, visits from national and foreign tourists strengthen the business activities that entrepreneurs have established throughout the city the last few years.  This city is the country\u2019s third-most populous and it also has agricultural, animal husbandry and manufacturing activities.\r\n\r\nOleica has been doing various activities throughout her life.   Three years ago she started selling cosmetics from place to place visiting customers who for the most part are women and offering them beauty consultation services.  The products Oleica offers are in high demand.  She spends mornings and afternoons along the city\u2019s long streets to sell her goods while not neglecting her mother\u2019s care or her household chores.  \r\n\r\nOleica has requested loans formerly to increase profits by varying her stock merchandise but has had no luck with her applications.  Now, she\u2019s come by Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa where with no obstacle she was trusted and granted a loan she\u2019ll use to buy products that are on special promotion so she can offer them to her customers at competitive prices and profits.  She will also increase income to cover household expenses and have a better lifestyle where neither she nor her mother will lack anything necessary to live a healthy, stable life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1276727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-15T18:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-14T18:50:13Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oleica Orlandina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":310.08,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":52.61},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":53.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":54.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.14},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":46.8,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":49.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068701,"comment":null},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":50.99,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":53.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494968,"comment":null},{"amount":53.96,"local_amount":51.49,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":53.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524896,"comment":null},{"amount":55.14,"local_amount":52.61,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":55.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133200,"comment":null},{"amount":56.13,"local_amount":53.55,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":56.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313740,"comment":null},{"amount":57.27,"local_amount":54.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":57.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995308,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-17T10:54:40Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":517399,"name":"Qayum","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u044e\u043c - \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0411.\u0413\u0430\u0444\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0434. \u0415\u043c\u0443 66 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u041a\u0430\u044e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0443\u0436\u0435 8 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e-\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u0427\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441, \u041a\u0430\u044e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442.

Her younger daughter is studying at the local medical college.  Her younger son is studying in school.  As a source of financial support for her family Sainakul has been raising livestock since the year 2000, having started this business with a sum of 15,000 som (KGS).  Today Sainakul's holdings include 10 cows, 40 sheep, 8 horses and 9 goats.  Her revenues from the sale of livestock are around 55,000 som per month.

","en":"Elvira is a 39-year-old woman. The difficult circumstances of her home did not allow her to complete her education so she only finished primary school. She got married at a very young age to Jos\u00e9, 33, who works as a construction worker. They have a child whom they hope to provide with an excellent and worthy education. \r\n\r\nThey live in Pastaza, a canton located in the province of the same name belonging to the Amazon region of the Republic of Ecuador. The main city of the canton is Puyo, a city located in the middle of the Amazon jungle to the west of the Pastaza province and at an altitude of 924 meters above sea level. It is demographically small, but it has a great variety of sites preferred by both national and international tourists, especially for their ecological activities and extreme sports. It is a city that grows economically every day through its activities of trade, ranching, farming, and tourism, for which financial and commercial companies have established local branches hoping to make use of the economic activity that this small city maintains. In every business, one can find people who have not given up when confronted with the lack of employment, but rather who have set forth with their ideas of business in order to live worthy lives and accomplish their dreams. \r\n\r\nElvira has been devoted to the domestic work of her household, but in the view of necessity and daily-increasing expenses, for 2 years now she has decided to contribute to the maintenance of her home. She undertook the raising of chickens and roosters to then later sell, an activity that she learned from a relative who trained her in the requirements of breeding such as the feeding, cleaning, providing care, etc. Presently, Elvria has learned very much about her business, into which she invests 8 to 10 hours daily, alternating with the domestic work of her home and the care of her child. She is an example of effort and endeavor, since now she will take the next step to grow her business by increasing her breeding grounds and buying more chickens. She is applying for this loan so that she will be able to fulfill this goal since she had not done it before because of a lack of funding and the difficulties of obtaining it. Now, she turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who--with the participation of Kiva--have offered her more flexibility and ease in obtaining this loan. She is grateful for the support, and also, for the personalized advice that she has received in order to go forward with her business and fulfill her goal of increasing her income in order to improve her quality of life, and in that way, be able to provide her child with the education that she herself did not have the opportunity to attain.

is 23 years old, single, and lives with his parents. He sells food such as macaroni, butter, cookies, sugar, tea, candies and beverages in his shop. Elvin has four years of experience in this field, which makes him a knowledgeable and skilled person.\r\n\r\nThe food products he sells are very popular and are in high demand. His monthly profit is 130 AZN. He sells products from his shop, which is in the back yard of the house he lives in.

is a 29-year-old married man and father to two sons. For the past two years, AlaaEdden has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and is the only source of income for his family, but he also needs some support to cover costs. The taxi he drives needs repairs such as installing new wheels and repainting. \r\n\r\nAlaaEdden took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help him to repair his taxi and increase the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself.

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nAydah is a 39-year-old married woman and a mother to two sons and three daughters. Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover all the family's needs.\r\n\r\nAydah and her husband own a taxi office.  They have had this business for four years. It is considered a very successful business because it is located in a very crowded area in Jabalia.  Aydah and her husband are very ambitious; they want to improve their project by buying office furniture and some communication devices to make the job more efficient. \r\n\r\nAydah took out a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Aydah and her husband to buy furniture and some communication devices for the taxi office. This will help to improve the project and increase the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

lives in the Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya. He is married and has one school going child. He owns a clothing shop, a business that he has been operating for two years. He started the business through his personal savings. He is also a driver of a public service vehicle. He mainly sells bedsheets.\r\nHe learnt about Milango through friends who invited him to the group and he joined the group with the aim of accessing credit to improve his business operations.

lives in Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya. She is a married business lady and runs a clothing business which she has been operating for eight years. In this business she sells shawls, handbags, pants, shoes etc. She has two children.\r\nShe learnt about Milango through friends who invited her to the group and she joined with the aim of accessing credit to improve her business operations.

She mainly offers curtains, bed sheets, blankets, and other home trappings. Seasonal demands for clothing like uniforms and such are available all year round. She also does repairs and alterations. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other items needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLorena hopes to give her grandchildren a good education and dreams of having a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Three years ago, he shifted to the agricultural industry and holds the position of vice chairman at a private business entity. In 2001, he began building his two flat mansion and currently completed his first flat.. Due to lack of finances, the second flat and half story are not finished completely. So he is requesting a loan of 6,700,000 MNT to purchase insulation and construction materials at its low price period. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place because the unfinished second flat repair was the main cause of heat loss. The house was so vulnerable to storms and frost. More importantly, the family will burn less coal due to the insulation and they will contribute to the efforts against air

Especially this year, when winter is becoming harsh and the family uses an electric heater to heat the house.

The loan will increase family income and improve the family's living standards.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Hellen owns a cow but does not own a pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, electricity, running water, television and DVD player but does not have solar power or a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile,

Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cLa Esperanza II\u201d [Hope II] and is made up of 18 entrepreneurs who work in different businesses, including selling used and new clothing, selling plastic items, curtain-making, handicrafts, selling groceries and other services.  They all live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nKatherine is a member of the group, and she is standing in the first row of the photo, the fourth person from right to left, dressed in blue jeans, a black-and-white checked polo, a dark turquoise vest, with dark, chestnut-colored hair worn loose, large flower earrings and sunglasses on top of her head.\r\n\r\nKatherine has been working for five years selling used clothing.  She says that she works three days per week at open-air markets, selling women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing in all sizes and different styles.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago from clothing distributors that specialize in selling by the bundle and at low cost, which economically suits her business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy bundles of clothing for the spring season.  One of Katherine\u2019s dreams is to renovate a space in her house to install a store and therefore wait on her customers more comfortably.  She says this would generate more income with which she could improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nKatherine lives with her husband and two children, ages 20 and 2.  Her dreams for her business are for it to grow day by day in order to provide for her children.  For her family, she dreams of one day being able to travel together.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful to Fondo Esperanza, since they have given her the opportunity to invest in and grow her business.  Katherine gets along very well with the members of the group because they communicate very well with each other.  As for the classes that are given, she has been able to incorporate all of the teachings relating to sales into her business.\r\n\r\nTalca is in the Maule Region, located in the central area of the country.  It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region and is the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a curious reference to Talca in the Chilean phrase \u201cTalca, Paris and London\u201d.  Among the many legends relating to this phrase, some say it derives from words originally spoken by a person from England, which are \u201cTalca parece Londres\u201d [Talca looks like London], because of the abundant mist that frequently covers the city during the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4825,"image":{"id":1277437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She\u2019s a kind, hardworking, enthusiastic person who focuses all her efforts into moving her family forward because she\u2019s always been both father and mother for her son.  Sadly, due to the lack of economic resources and the need to go to work, Anita was unable to study a professional career but would have liked very much to have been able to do so.  In her free time she enjoys watching television and occasionally cooks delicious noodles to share with her family.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Anita works in a small business selling beverages.  She sells various drinks made from barley, passion fruit, chicha [corn-based drink], etc.  She works every day from early in the morning and can work about 8 hours daily.  Anita feels good doing her work and believes she does well because of the good way she does her work and because of the kind way she treats her customers.\r\n\r\nAnita is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the help provided she will be able to buy ingredients like fresh fruit, sugar, containers, disposable glasses, etc. for her business.  In this way, Anita will be able to provide better service and tend to more customers so she can continue working and striving towards reaching her great dream of owning her own sales stand.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1276113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

No alcanz\u00f3 a continuar sus estudios en la universidad y termin\u00f3 la secundaria. Es madre soltera y ha tenido que salir adelante con sus 3 hijos a quienes educa para un d\u00eda verlos convertidos en profesionales. Ha sido dif\u00edcil para ella afrontar sola su realidad, pero sus hijos se han convertido en su inspiraci\u00f3n para conseguir las metas que se ha propuesto. Yajaira vive con sus hijos en el cant\u00f3n Pastaza ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta ciudad. La competencia entre microempresarios es muy grande, sin embargo cada uno ha puesto su valor agregado para ganar preferencia con los clientes. \nYajaira al ver la necesidad en su hogar y sin ninguna puerta abierta en las empresas por su falta de educaci\u00f3n superior, decidi\u00f3 abrir sus horizontes y emprender abriendo una tienda de abarrotes en el Barrio La Dolorosa, en donde existen viviendas y colegios de donde provienen sus principales clientes. Abre las puertas de su negocio desde muy temprano en la ma\u00f1ana hasta casi el atardecer, trabajando desde 9 hasta 12 horas cada d\u00eda. Gracias a este negocio, Yajaira puede llevar a su casa el sustento para sus hijos, sin embargo, muchas veces no puede abastecer al 100% la demanda de sus clientes por la falta de variedad en algunos productos, los cuales no ha podido adquirir por la falta de capital y las dificultades para obtener el mismo. Ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para agregar variedad a su negocio y poder incrementar sus ingresos, lo que le ayudar\u00e1 a invertir en una educaci\u00f3n de excelencia para sus hijos y para salir adelante como familia. Yajaira agradece el apoyo y asesor\u00eda que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa le ha brindado para cumplir su meta de hacer su negocio m\u00e1s grande y adem\u00e1s por la confianza que han depositado en ella. ","en":"Yajaira is 26 years old. In her youth, she has had a difficult life due to limited financial resources and a lack of compassion her household. She was unable to continue her studies at the university, but she did finish secondary school. She is a single mother and had to push forward by educating her 3 children so that they can enter the professional workforce. It has been difficult for her to face these challenges alone, but her children have inspired her to reach the goals she set for herself.\r\n\r\nYajaira lives with her children in the Pastaza canton, in the province of the same name, which belongs to the Amazonian region of Ecuador. The most important place in this canton is Puyo city, located in the middle of the Amazon in the western Pastaza province at an altitude of 924 meters above sea level. Demographically it is a small, but it has a large variety of sites, the more salient of those being eco-tourism activities and extreme sports, preferred by national and international tourists. It is a city that grows economically day by day because of trade, livestock, farming, and tourism. It has established branches of financial and commercial enterprises that try to benefit from the economic activity present in the city. There is a lot of competition between small businesses, however each one has made their value known to obtain customers.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing her home in need and closed doors to many of the city's businesses due to her lack of higher education, she decided to broaden her horizons by starting a general store in the La Dolorosa neighborhood. This area contained many houses and schools which provided her primary customers. She opens the door to her business early in the morning until it becomes late, working between 9 and 12 hours per day. \r\n\r\nThanks to her business, Yajaira can support her household and her children. However, she can not meet 100 percent of her customer's demand because she lacks those products, ones she has been unable to acquire due to the lack of money and accessibility.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to obtain a greater variety of products in her store so she can increase her revenue. This will help her invest in an excellent education for her children and help the family move forward. \r\n\r\nYajaira is thankful for the help, advice, and confidence that Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has provided which enabled her to reach her goal of making her business larger."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1276070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock up on a variety of better products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Puyo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-01-16T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-02-15T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yajaira Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":533.6,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":36.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43.53},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.91},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":49.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.63,"local_amount":12.25,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516845,"comment":null},{"amount":24.5,"local_amount":23.77,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":24.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068699,"comment":null},{"amount":85.92,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494966,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":42.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524894,"comment":null},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":43.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":44.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133198,"comment":null},{"amount":92.1,"local_amount":89.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":92.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565344,"comment":null},{"amount":47.32,"local_amount":45.91,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":47.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814386,"comment":null},{"amount":198.91,"local_amount":192.98,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":198.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856260,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-01-16T21:55:52Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T15:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":518103,"name":"Miguel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Miguel vive en casa propia est\u00e1 casado pero separado de la esposa, tiene tres hijos los cuales ya son independientes, la casa est\u00e1 ubicada en la zona Tembladerani de la Ciudad de la Paz.\n\nMiguel es jubilado rentista, y requiere el cr\u00e9dito para pagar una consulta m\u00e9dica en  oftalmolog\u00eda en una cl\u00ednica privada debido a que los centros de salud de la caja son muy precarios y toma tiempo conseguir una cita.

He is 33 years old, married, with two children aged five and nine who are in school and live at home. He is a high school graduate and has a certificate in medicine. He worked as a physician's assistant to start this business, where he sells lots of drugs. One problem that he faced is the price of the drugs because he has to purchase the medicine in USD, and now the exchange rate USD to LRD is too high. He enjoys the many cases he receives every day. Whenever he doesn\u2019t go to sell, his customers get  angry with him because sometimes he executes first aid. Most interestingly his business helps to pay his children's school fees and rent. Having enough money to support his home makes him proud of his business. He is asking for a loan to purchase more drugs like cough tablets and syrups, Paracetamol, Quinine, Amodaquine, etc. to increase his commodities to render good treatment to his customers.
