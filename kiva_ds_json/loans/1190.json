","en":"Sanobar is the vivacious and attentive mother of three children.  Her husband used to work in a factory but he didn't make enough for the family to live on, so in order to feed the family and secure their children's future, he went to work in the Russian Federation.  He sends money on a regular, monthly basis.  \r\n\r\nSanobar, by herself at home, earns a living fattening up cattle.  Her eldest son helps her out.  The cattle graze in mountain pastures from March to November.  The villagers take turns keeping an eye on them.  The business provides Sanobar with a nice profit.

The members joined hands and formed the group to stand for one another in times of need, and they still continue the pledge. \r\n\r\n\r\nKumari runs the grocery store in the front yard of her house. Her husband also helps her in the store by running errands for her since he left his driving job. She sells potatoes, onions, edible oil, garlic, etc. She opens the store at the break of the dawn and closes down at late evening. She manages the household chores and also runs the store. \r\n\r\nShe usually gets the supplies from the main market and sells them. The store is a success, as she has buyers thronging in round the clock, but she is incapable of supplying the demands. The generated income is used for her children\u2019s educational fees and other household expenses, which generally paralyzes her in refilling her stock for the store. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, Kumari will refill the store and manage some savings. Happy and elated, Kumari shares that she has plans to purchase an auto vehicle in the future. Her husband can drive and run the vehicle for public transportation. The store is the main source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nKiva and WSDS join hands; supporting the group is a blessing, and the group members will work harder for better performance so that each of them can make a stand financially and morally. Kumari says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in sand-sieving, weaving, and vegetable-selling

He lives in the village of Maghlaki, West Georgia with his wife, infant daughter and retired grandmother. \r\n\r\nDima requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The family is involved in a small scale agricultural business. They run a family-owned dairy farm with four milk cows. The family produces cheese and sells it in the village. In addition, they grow nuts and grapes which are used in wine production. \r\n\r\nDima sells his products seasonally, but the income is not enough to provide the family with adequate living conditions. Dima has requested a loan from Credo to start a poultry business. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions to the country's vulnerable poor for business start-ups and re-start-ups.

Graduated from a government college and possessed a caring and strong personality, sincerity in work and  great determination is Linroukim\u2019s character. She is on the extreme left in the picture with her hand raised. All eight members belongs to a tribal community and live in a village which is about 40 kms away from the state capital of Imphal, which is one of the North-Eastern state capital in India. As an eldest daughter in the family, she takes on the role with passion and has shown immense sincerity in whatever she does for the family and for herself.\r\n\r\nLinroukim runs a general store in the village. The store is located at the other end of the village, on the closer side of the town market. The town market is where people from all neighbouring villages have stores and run their businesses. She sells imported rice, salt, chillies, sugar, milk, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, different items of cereals, detergent soap, detergent powder, hair oil, sachets of shampoo, local delicacies, etc. She is in charge of the store only in the morning and in the afternoon as she teaches in primary private school during the daytime. Her mother usually replaces her in daytime and she closes the accounts at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nLinroukim's father\u2019s income is insufficient to support the family with her three younger siblings in different schools. She initiated all possible ways to share her father\u2019s burden and started earning by opening a general store besides teaching in a school. On restricted holidays she usually gets the supplies from the town market and sells them in the village. The generated income is not enough to refill the stocks on a regular basis as her father\u2019s income in unreliable and irregular. Most of the expenditure is borne by her to fulfill the family's needs.\r\n\r\nShe wants a loan from Kiva to purchase more supplies for the store. She will buy all the essential goods like rice, edible oil, wheat by the bag, flour by the bag, soaps, shampoos etc. Expansion of the store is the vital plan as she wishes to continue the general store even after she is married. Another future plan she has with her family is to re-construct their house; the leaking roof during rainy season and the dilapidated condition of the roof and mud walls needs to change. If their plans are successful then they will build the house very soon. \r\n\r\nLinroukim thanks Kiva and WSDS for helping her achieve some portion of her plan and which will eventually become the platform to start off. She says \"thank you so much, Kiva\u201d.

active and like to have fun during their monthly meetings. The women enjoy participating in the educational lessons that are part of their microcredit loan from Friendship Bridge.  The educational lesson topics range from business and money management to women's rights and health. Within their Trust Bank, they have created a circle of trust which fosters mutual support between all the women in the circle.\n\nSusana is a member of Mujeres Activas.  She is a very sociable woman who is constantly seeking opportunities to ensure her family\u2019s development. Susana is 45 years old, married to a farmer, and has six children.\n\nSusana owns a business that sells snacks to members of her community.  She sells seven days a week during the afternoons. Susana has a small space in her house that she sells the snacks from but she also sells door-to-door for the convenience of her customers. \n\nAbout 10 months ago, Susana and her oldest son opened a new business that makes and sells pi\u00f1atas and other party items. Although this venture is currently a small-scale operation, they have a plan for growing the party business. Susana is requesting a loan with Friendship Bridge to continue to expand her businesses. She intends to use the funds to buy a wagon for selling snacks door-to-door, add more items to her store and also purchase materials in bulk to make pi\u00f1atas. \n\n\"It's a blessing to have the support of Friendship Bridge because it benefits not only me, but my whole family. It allows my son and I to invest in the new business. This party business will help him continue his education. My dream is to see him graduate from college - he is already taking steps toward this goal as he is already in ninth grade,\" explains Susana.\n\nThe Mujeres Activas Trust Bank, represented by its board of directors (president, secretary and treasurer), thank their Kiva investors wholeheartedly because their help benefits towns like the one the women live in (Santo Domingo Xenacoj Guatemala), which is in need of development, and without this kind of support, their dreams would not be possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2687.5,"image":{"id":1399771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a wagon for selling snacks and items for her pi\u00f1ata store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Magaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8410.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089116,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419855085,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503421,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728405,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-11T21:31:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593817,"name":"Aba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Due to difficult circumstances, Aba did not have access to any form of formal education, yet this has not stopped her from achieving her dream of becoming an entrepreneur.

She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \n\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an ukay-ukay stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, also used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\n\nJosefina dreams of having a beautiful store and hopes to build a beautiful house.

She is an enterprising woman who has a strong desire to fight to get ahead for her daughters so that she can give them a better future.  \r\n\r\nPaola aspires to study hospitality and tourism, because she has always enjoyed this line of work, and most of all, because she wants to provide good financial stability for her daughters.

The group\u2019s members all live in large traditional families in Kangar\u00e9, located in the sub-prefecture of Selingue (in the Sakasso region of Mali).\r\n\r\nThese women have worked in small-scale retail for several years, and are all in high demand. In order to meet the growing needs of their customers, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, and are now on their fifth group loan.\r\n\r\nMaimouna is pictured first on the left in the photo, and is the president of the group. She is very well-known in Kangar\u00e9, and plans to use her loan to buy ten sacks of millet and five sacks of peanuts. She gets her supplies in Dalabala and the surrounding areas, and sells her cereals in Kangar\u00e9 on a retail basis for cash and on credit. Her customers are both male and female.\r\n\r\nMaimouna hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA, which will allow her to repay her loan and reinvest in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.5,"image":{"id":1409858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy agricultural products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kangar\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-08-16T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-15T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68018.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924439,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":68018.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207627,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":68018.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972306,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":68018.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624866,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":68018.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T04:18:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593847,"name":"Valentina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentina is married with three children and all those children go to school.

is 37-year-old Edna. She is married and has three children aged five, ten and eighteen. In 1993, Edna established her drinks, toiletries and provisions business. She began her business because she wants to assist her husband to run the affairs of the children. Her business is located in the outskirts and her main customers are adults. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

","en":"Estela is an enterprising young woman of 22. She lives in her mother's house. Both of them have businesses: her mother works buying and selling fresh fish and Estela works selling pupusas [stuffed tortillas] and helps her mother with her business.\r\n\r\nEstela only has a basic education that she received in her community school. Afterwards she stopped going to school because it was very difficult to continue with high school because of how far away the school was. She would have had to travel about 10 km by bus and the costs would have been high. Instead she stayed at home and was in a relationship for a period of time. But her partner left her when he emigrated to the United States and she has lost communication with him.\r\n   \r\nShe is the owner of a small business selling pupusas, which she sells in the afternoons in front of her house. She has been doing this for four years and sometimes works as a housekeeper. She learned the business from her mother who has always engaged in commercial activities and from a job that she had in a canteen in the lower part of the lake. When she left this job she decided to work independently. Her mother helps her with the business in the afternoons and she helps her mother with the fish business and the housekeeping chores in the morning. \r\n\r\nPreviously Estela sought a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo in order to start up the pupusa stand that is her current source of income. Things are going along very well since with her earnings she has purchased a two-month-old piglet to fatten with the leftover products from the tortilla stand.\r\n\r\nPresently she is seeking a new loan in order to buy rice, meat, cabbage, sauces, oil, a propane cylinder, etc. in order to make pupusas. With the loan she hopes to maintain the existing business and add a new one that consists of the purchase\/sale of supplies (food) which she hopes to sell with her neighbors, as she has recognized a business opportunity to increase her income with this activity.\r\n\r\nThe client states that she started out with little but that she hopes to have a better stocked store some day and carry all products for sale, not only groceries. She would like to build a large passageway in the front part of the house and locate her pupusa business there. Since she currently has to take the grill for the pupusas out to the edge of the street every day, she has no tables for customers who visit her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.53,"image":{"id":1410244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase corn, meat, cabbage, sauces, oil, a propane gas cylinder, etc. in order to make pupusas [stuffed tortillas].","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela Yamileth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":39.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":49.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":51.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.64},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.32,"local_amount":34.32,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815021,"comment":null},{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":39.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":39.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090858,"comment":null},{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":33.71,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":33.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856855,"comment":null},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":40.47,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-18T18:28:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":595316,"name":"Mahuklo 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"MAHUKLO 6 est un groupe compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui sont des amies et qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame village.

This is how she learned everything she needed to know to do this work in a way that would make it very economically beneficial. When she turned 20, her parents left her 4 blocks of land planted with cocoa and, together with her partner, she began working for her family's wellbeing. Her work in the fields brings her good income as, along with her partner and some contract workers, she constantly tends the cocoa trees so that at the end of the season the pods are in good condition to be sold at the collection centers in her area. For environmental reasons, she only uses organic fertilizers on her land. One of her greatest inconveniences is transporting the heavy sacks full of dried grains from their land to the city as the access routes are narrow and this means she has to spend more money.

For about two years, Kenneth says it was more of a hobby, but as of March, 2013, Kenneth turned his hobby into a full-time business after people started asking for music from his personal library.\r\n\r\nKenneth worked on obtaining music from rappers in the Houston area and selling it to rap lovers in the Dallas area. As the business demand grew, he knew the next thing to do would be to open a store where people could drive to him, instead of making deliveries as he once did.\r\n\r\nNow that Kenneth has an established location for his business, he needed a loan to market it, purchase inventory and pay rent. He turned to nonprofit microlender Accion Texas Inc. when a quick Google search introduced him to it, and he was approved for funds to help support his business. He now purchases music wholesale directly from musicians.  \r\n\r\nBefore the loan, Kenneth marketed his business at barbershops and car washes and relied heavily on word-of-mouth.  Because of the loan, he is now able to keep his store shelves full of local music, support other musicians during a time when piracy is the norm, create a living for those musicians, and become a successful entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nWhen he\u2019s not at the shop, Kenneth has another job as a landscaper, but the income from that job is invested mostly in the store\u2019s costs. He also uses those earnings to create music of his own.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1407374,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs & Tapes","sector":"Retail","use":"to market his music store, purchase inventory and pay rent.

She used her previous loans to open a fruit and vegetable business, and she bought more and better quality salon equipment.

Khalida sorts according to size, quality, and type, and she categorizes the biscuits. Her daughter packs the cookies into polythene and then Khalida's husband sells the biscuits in the market. Each family member has different duties assigned to them for packaging the cookies.\r\n\r\nRetailers like to buy these biscuits due to the low rates, and children also like to eat these biscuits. Shopkeepers have demanded more biscuits in order to increase their sales. For this reason, Khalida requested a loan of 40,000 Rs. from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan. With this loan, Khalida will buy more biscuits so that she can meet the demand of the retailers.\r\n\r\nKhalida is very thankful to Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.97,"image":{"id":1408021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a merchant and farmer and has no dependents. She and her spouse work in agriculture; they plant corn, beans and coffee, and sometimes raise pigs. She completed primary education thanks to the support of her parents. \r\n\r\nHer customers are owners of local grocery stores and shops in the area where she lives and its surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges that faces people who work in agriculture is the increasing cost of agricultural inputs that they use to grow and care for their crops. This is why Paula has asked for financial support from COMIXMUL, in order to buy necessary products and keep her crops clear of pests. This way she will prevent her crops from contaminating one another with diseases.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to see her children grow up and become professionals, even though she doesn't have any children yet.

Besides farming she also has a transportation business using motor-bikes.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo of KES.62,400 to help her in purchasing a dairy cow.
