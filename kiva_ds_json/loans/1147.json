He also sells phone credit for extra income. \n\nAfter learning about technologies designed for people living in remote communities, Gede was very keen to sell these technologies in his community. He saw a market for solar lights that can help people living in areas with limited access to electricity, and for water filters for people who usually drink straight from rain water because clean water is very hard to get, and for clean, fuel-efficient cookstoves for households who still use three-stone stoves which produce a lot of harmful smoke.\n\nHe will use the loan to purchase these technologies and set up a technology kiosk, the first on Nusa Penida selling life-changing, eco-friendly technologies.

With effort, continuous work, and the training that she receives, she is sure that her situation will continue to improve. \r\n\r\nMercedes earns a living selling foods that she herself prepares very early in the day. She notes that she has good customers who wait in the early morning hours to eat her delicious foods. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan to invest in the purchase of meat, vegetables, condiments, ham, cheese, eggs and other supplies to be able to continue delighting her customers with the delicious meals that she makes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1373590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat, vegetables, condiments, ham, cheese, eggs and other supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2013-06-19T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-19T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joaquina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorgelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":11443820,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1907304},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1907304},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1907304},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1907304},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1907304},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1907300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":433.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":1907304,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1912891.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390570547,"comment":null},{"amount":433.34,"local_amount":1907304,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-22T08:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1912891.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400810182,"comment":null},{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":1907304,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1912891.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095597,"comment":null},{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":1907304,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1912891.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419861218,"comment":null},{"amount":433.34,"local_amount":1907304,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1912891.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429509685,"comment":null},{"amount":433.33,"local_amount":1907300,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1912887.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439733465,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-22T22:58:24Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:14:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573521,"name":"Virgen Del Rosario Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"15 mujeres muy trabajadoras forman parte de este grupo, ellas est\u00e1n en su quinto ciclo del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, cada una tiene como meta poder ayudar a sus familias por medio de su trabajo.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

He lives in his parents' house in the community of Sulcataca Baja in the Laja area of Los Andes Province in La Paz Department, three hours from the city of La Paz.  Edwin has some head of improved cattle, which require better care because of the area's climate conditions.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy supplementary feed because in the area there's a deficit of raw protein in the barley fodder and it's necessary in the low-water season (June-November).  During this critical season the nutrition of dairy cows is improved using supplements such as corn flour, soy chaff, bran, and other things.  Buying supplementary feed will mitigate the pressure on expanding more areas of fodder production.\r\n\r\nThis way he'll be able to improve his product and keep his cows healthy.

Tatyana needs a loan in the amount of 22,000 hryvnia to purchase bags, jars, lids and other household goods for canning berries, fruits and vegetables.  Summer is the season for canning for many people in Ukraine.  Many Ukrainians love dachas and grow their vegetables on small land plots, and then can fruits and vegetables to prepare for the winter.

When he grew up, he began to work a lot because he had a family and needed to get ahead in life. His parents decided to help him, gifting him a small plot of land with fields of cocoa that helped him start independently. Today he says he has a hectare of crops where he also has fruit trees. To improve the quality of his products he usually uses organic fertilizer because he thinks using artificial fertilizers deteriorates the quality of his soil.

He works buying and selling frozen fish, an activity that he has been doing for 6 years along with 2 associates who help him select, transport, and sell the fish.  With this business, he is able to support his family, giving them a tranquil life where their needs are provided for.  His constant desire to achieve led him to start up this business, and over time it is becoming well known, because he sells the freshest and tastiest fish in the market.  At first it was very complicated for him to adapt to this routine, because he didn't know the business well.  But over time, he has grown the business.  What he likes most about his work is talking to his customers.  What he considers most difficult is putting up with the intense smell that emanates from the fish, because this impregnates his clothing and his body.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of this, he hopes in the future to have a vehicle that he can set up to transport his products and keep them fresh for much longer.  This will be his 6th loan with Kiva, and he is grateful for this opportunity and for the trust being provided to him so that he can get ahead.  For this reason, he promises to make his payments on time.  With the sum of 2,500 Peruvian soles that he requests, he will buy a variety of different fish of the best sizes, so that he can continue to sell them.

She also searches for edible grass in the nearby fields and farms for pig feed. The foods are then cooked with powdered rice grain. The rice grain is bought from the rice mill at a cheaper rate. Once the pigs are fully grown and ready to be sold, she usually sells them in the village and neighbouring villages. She also bought a used two-wheeler Scooty (scooter) from the income that she generated from selling pigs. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is planning to purchase chicks and start raising poultry besides raising pigs. She said her huge backyard should be utilized, and it should be of good use for raising poultry, too. Her interest in raising chicks started because pigs can be sold only once in a year, and if she can raise chickens, she can sell them after a time period of three months. She speculates she can sell poultry four times in a year, and is hopeful to be successful with her poultry.\r\n\r\nShe thanked WSDS strongly and says her husband\u2019s love and respect grows more with the ability to share family financial issues. \u201cThe bond is stronger and the family\u2019s burden is lighter with both of us sharing.\u201d She thanked Kiva and WSDS once again for all the support and assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1370839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase chicks, raise them, and sell them for profit when fully grown.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T00:40:19Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T00:40:19Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengtinlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoikhohat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimthenhat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoilenmawi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanlalngak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lamkhol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neklomkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T16:29:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572625,"name":"Farolitos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento FAROLITOS est\u00e1  compuesto por ocho  integrantes todas mujeres,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

is 30 years old.

Shalva requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of the family is Shalva\u2019s monthly salary. He works at the Georgian bread bakery. Their additional income is Shalva\u2019s grandfather\u2019s monthly pension. The total amount is 500 GEL and it\u2019s rarely enough to cover food expenses. \r\n\r\nShalva requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shalva has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Shalva will start trading with vegetables. He will buy at the wholesale price to resell with a price mark-up among the villagers and at the local markets. Shalva is very hard working man. He wants to improve his family living conditions and for this he will work as hard as he can.  Part of the profit he will reinvest in the same field to expand the business and another part to purchase household products for the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1371758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to start up a vegetable trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Vejini","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T01:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T01:10:10Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shalva ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":26.3},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":32.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.83,"local_amount":27.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":27.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749770,"comment":null},{"amount":25.9,"local_amount":25.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613754,"comment":null},{"amount":26.3,"local_amount":26.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857466,"comment":null},{"amount":26.98,"local_amount":26.98,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":26.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134116,"comment":null},{"amount":27.88,"local_amount":27.88,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":27.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107703,"comment":null},{"amount":215.11,"local_amount":215.11,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":215.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T02:38:12Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572479,"name":"Paul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paul is a forty-two year-old married man with three children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

Martina owns a computer shop. These computer shops are rented for Php 20.00 per hour. Still, some families don\u2019t have their own computers so they go to computer shops to encode and print documents. Others rent to connect with their loved ones abroad, and others, especially the children and the youth, rent to play games. Normally, computer shops open at 8am and close at 7pm. Her regular customers are the children and youth of their community. She earns Php 400.00 a day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting Php 25,000 that she will use to buy new units of computers and maintain the other units that she has.\r\n\r\nJust as any other business owners, she is also hoping that her shop will continue to expand and have more customers and branches.

This is why she contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for her second loan of PKR 30,000 to buy leather and spools of thread in large quantities. This will help her to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nKalsoom is very experienced in her business. She is confident that her business will move toward a positive direction as a result of this loan investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.84,"image":{"id":1371616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy leather and spools of thread in large quantities.

She has just been involved in her current business for two years, earning about 18,800 KHR per day. This is not the first microloan for Sreyoeurn with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). She has fully repaid her past loan with success and it has enabled her to support her business promptly and relieve her family's burden. Now, she is applying for a new loan in order to buy an additional plot of farmland and a water pump, and to use a portion of it to support her vegetable garden. She hopes to grow her cash crops healthily so that she can gain a high, good yield with a good selling

Upon exiting the military in 2010, they felt a deep responsibility to contribute to social change and provide a way of saying \u201cThank you\u201d to veterans.  Thus the idea of repurposing real bullets into bottle openers was created, with a goal to raise funds for veteran-focused groups.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Bullets2Bandages is to provide simple ways for every American to show their support and gratitude for veterans.  They donate 15% of all their profits to veteran-focused groups, including the The Travis Manion Foundation.  Cole and Erik believe strongly in the power of social responsibility and social innovation.  Together they strive to create a company that is responsible in its business practices and always has a cause.  Within their company they try to hire veterans, helping them transition into the civilian workforce.  \r\n\r\nTwo years after starting out, their business has grown into a dedicated warehouse and employs seven full-time employees.  However, what is most remarkable about their business is the strong community they\u2019ve built on social media.  Their Facebook page has over 130,000 followers who are all passionate about supporting veterans!\r\n\r\nCole and Erik\u2019s $10,000 Kiva loan will be used to streamline their business processes and fund new product development.  With your help, Cole and Evan can continue to give back to veterans and their families in need of support.\r\n\r\nA message from Cole and Erik: \u201cThank you to everyone in the Kiva community.  The support that each of you gives inspires entrepreneurs to succeed across the world and changes people\u2019s lives.  In the future, we plan to come back to Kiva and invest in other business ventures and to continue to be a part of the Kiva community.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more information on Bullets2Bandages, visit their

This is 43-year-old Mbalu, from Waterloo, an eastern area in Freetown. She is married, with four children between the ages of 17 and 27 years. Three of her children attend school. She started business for the daily survival of her family.\r\n \r\nMbalu runs a food-stand business. She sells chicken and fish within a busy market area. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business nine hours per day, seven days per week.   Mbalu says that the main challenges to her business are transportation problems and price fluctuations.\r\n\r\nMbalu has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities for resale, like cooking oil and packaged chicken. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mbalu plans to have a permanent business residence. She thanks you for your support!\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":158.24,"image":{"id":1372120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It is made up of nine hard-working female members, who over time have been improving their lives through their businesses. One of the members is Lucia. She is married with eight children. Two of her children are still in school. At 58 years of age, Lucia has managed to fulfil some of her dreams, such as improving her home and helping her children with their studies.\r\n\r\nFor more than five years Lucia has made a living by selling soft maize-based food. She sells this from outside her home. She will use the loan to buy supplies, such as sugar, milk, and rice. Her greatest wish is to set up a space where she can offer her products and thereby give her diners better attention. \r\n\r\nThe group is grateful to Kiva investors for their help. Lucia is the third from the right; she is wearing a black jacket and a fuchsia-coloured turtleneck top.  Miriam could not be present for reasons pertaining to her job.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3100,"image":{"id":1370427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sugar, milk, and rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vite Eufracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Matilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simeona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Katy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Apolonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2125},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390557750,"comment":null},{"amount":775,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399806776,"comment":null},{"amount":775,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410082888,"comment":null},{"amount":775,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2135.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419849315,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-20T22:12:56Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T14:17:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572641,"name":"Marco Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio Marco Antonio se sigue dedicando al negocio de brindar servicio de taxi,el socio tiene un carroq ue hace servicio de taxi en las diferentes calles de la ciudad de Cusco,el socio sigue vendiendo cervezas y gaseosas,el socio por medio de estos negocios quiere salir adelante,el socio se dedica a estos peque\u00f1os negocios 4 a\u00f1os,el sue\u00f1o del socio es tener un carro nuevo.El socio solicita el credito para comprar cervezas y gaseosas.\n\nEl socio se encuentra contento por el pr\u00e9stamo pues se compromete a pagar sus cuotas puntualmente y agradece por la ayuda brindada.\n","en":"Marco Antonio continues to work in the taxi service business.

This is her story.\nI am Rose from Malindi, Kenya, a town along the Indian Ocean. I come from a needy family of four headed by a father who is a waiter in a tourist Hotel. I live in a society where education is highly degraded and traditions given first priority. This is characterized by early marriages of girls at premature ages, high rate of HIV\/AIDS and drug and substance abuse. This is very disheartening as the society continues to lag behind as many young people succumb to the vices. Coming from such a society gives me the strong will to make it in life and give back to my society. However, this will be only a dream because of the financial status of my family, thus I result in turning to KIVA for a loan that will enable me to successfully acquire university education at Strathmore University. Upon the completion of my education I intend to give back to my society by starting an organisation that will strive to highlight the need to eradicate early marriages. Secondly I intend through the organization to educate the society on the negatives of drug and substance abuse, thus creating a difference in the society. I trust that the KIVA loan will make my dream a reality. It is my commitment that I will comply with the terms and conditions governing the Kiva loan for the betterment of the organisation at large."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.39,"image":{"id":1368778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

name is Phyllis. I am the third born of three children born to a single mother here in Nairobi. I have always had the passion for pursuing law but in recent times, I learnt more about the concept of digital law. In the time that I have been out of school, I have engaged in activities that have resolved even more clearly my desire to join the Strathmore Law program. I have worked tirelessly with Creative Commons, an organization that has redefined the licensing methodologies in the Internet. I am the lead of the School of Open Initiative in Kenya, which is work that deals with introducing young high school students to Open Educational Resources that they can take advantage of in the Internet. \r\nHowever, I am unable to raise the funds to study at Strathmore University because my family is not financially endowed with the capacity to cater for my fees. Attending law school will sharpen me more on the issues of Intellectual property, as I believe the future for Africa\u2019s children is the provision of Open licensed resources. The KIVA loan will not only make my dreams come true, it will give me a lee way to form a basis for the future of Africa\u2019s learning

This is his story.\nMy name is Josphat. I am from a family of four children; I am the eldest. My parents have no stable income and rely on our small piece of land to cater for our needs education included. The  sales from our single dairy cow and the farm products is not enough and have led to my parents struggle much to raise us. The situation was made worse by them spending a lot on my treatment. They are also paying for my brother who is in secondary and the other will be joining secondary next year.\n I was born with leg problems and was forced to stay at a disabled children\u2019s home undergoing treatment for 2 years when I was young. Despite the challenges I have worked hard and devoted to give my all to ensure their efforts are paid. I have also been involved in community based groups where we have been helping the needy in the society such as the elderly. I really need financial assistance so that I can see my dream come true and also be able to help others in the society. I look forward for your assistance and thanks in advance.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1374845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

I would like to study the course of Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management at Strathmore University. I am doing so, so as to achieve my long life dream of becoming a CEO in an International Hotel and thereby assisting my parents in catering for my siblings' future expenses.  My father is currently not in a formal employment but is engaged in part time jobs while my mother is in a small scale business locally; selling 2nd hand clothes. I plan to commit myself in community service in the Campus Kiva, by joining the Red Cross projects as I am certified in the area. I will also participate in other community work projects for the needy, such as the 'Marter Hospital Heart run'. In future I plan to also lend money to other deserving students, through Kiva to ensure continuity and a bright future for

This is his story.\nMy name is George; a first born in a family of three. My mother passed away in 2004.\nI have always wanted to study information technology and become an expert in that area - but I do not have the means to afford university education to pursue a degree course. My father, who is a painter, depends on casual labour to take care of the family and with his meager earnings which is hand to mouth and there is nothing to save for my university education.\nI am glad to have been selected for KIVA loan, which will finance my studies at Strathmore University so that I can realize my dreams of becoming an Information Technology specialist.  There was no other way that I could have pursued my University education were it not for KIVA loan. I feel like I have stepped into my dream. While at Strathmore I will take part in Campus KIVA activities and bring positive change to the lives of other. In Future I also intend to give to KIVA by being a lender on KIVA website.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":14625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1373041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The reasons why I went for the Kiva loan were: first with the loan I will able to access higher education and take I course that will enable achieve my dreams of becoming a software engineer and second it is not easy to take  this course in Kenyan public universities.\nIf one gets a chance, the location and learning facilities can not compare with those of Strahmore University.\nMy mother is a casual labourer and does not even earn enough to meet the basic family expenses.\nI believe that a degree in Bsc. Informatics and the skills I will get will enable me become a top software engineer. Thank you very much for giving me a chance and other needy bright students from poor backgrounds.\nI will do the same in future and while at Strathmore I will work with Campus KIVA to bring positive change in the lives of others.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1369569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\nMy name is Brenda Mwendwa. I would like to undertake a Bachelor of Business Science in Financial Economics in Strathmore University. I have one elder sibling, a sister.  I applied for the course at Strathmore University because of its good quality of educational services and facilities.  Upon graduation, I would like to become a financial analyst in a bank. This will enable me to give investment suggestions to clients and evaluate the economic outlook on different sectors and industries.\nThe reason why I applied for Kiva loan is because my parents could not be able to afford the fees for the whole course. My sister also depends on my parents for financial support though she is self-employed. The Kiva loan will also ensure that I study well without any financial setbacks. In studying the course at the university, I am planning to join the Campus Kiva Club that will help me build my professional skills and participate in community service projects. I also plan to become a lender in the Kiva Organisation once I get a stable job so that I can help other needy students to acquire financial support and achieve their dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":15525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":292.48,"image":{"id":1367949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\nMy name is Totona and I come from Narok county,  from a polygamous family. My father has nine wives. Currently living with my mother and  three brothers. Given this opportunity, I will be the first to join University while the other two are in primary school and another in secondary school. I chose to study at Strathmore University because of its quality education and high moral conduct among students. I want to study Bachelor of Science in telecommunications and work for a senior manager for one of the telecommunications companies after my graduation. I hope that one day I will be a role model for the community that I come from. In Narok, most young men and boys spend days and nights moving herds of cows from area to another looking for pasture. In future, I will also lend on KIVA site.

This is his story.\nMy name is Jackson. I hail from a humble background. I was born alone before the passing of my mother while I was 10 years of age. As a result, I was left under care of my aunt. She had a son and 2 daughters. With so much financial problems and assistance from USAID APHIA PLUS and well wishers we managed to complete secondary education for me and my male cousin. I was the only one who managed to get an admission in public university after passing my National Exam.\nI have applied for KIVA loan for assistance since I found it difficult in paying tuition fees and would like to pursue my degree in Bachelor of Commerce. Upon completion of my education, I intend to give back to the society by starting an organization that will help other needy, orphans and potential individuals through their education to make their dream true.\nI believe that KIVA  will make my dream a reality by enabling me to pursue my career course at Strathmore University where I will obtain quality education from skilled lecturers. It also has an enabling environment for learning with high standards of discipline.\nI promise to comply with terms and conditions governing the KIVA loan for the betterment of the organization at large.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1371731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The main reason of taking this loan is to solve financial problems in payment of tuition fees and get enough time to concentrate in my studies and achieve top grades. I am joining to pursue a degree in law course and later be equal field lawyer capable to apply the knowledge in places where people are in quest for justice.\n\nMy hopes and dreams is to get the Kiva loan and study hard to achieve my goals, moreover to get a job immediately after my course and  start repaying the loan as a sign of respect and gratitude to the lenders.   At Strathmore I will take part in Campus Kiva activities.

Both of my siblings are in schools, one in high school four and the other in primary. My parents work as peasant farmers in the dry lands of Kitui County. In my district there are only a few who have managed to study up to the University Level, mainly due to lack of financial capabilities. I completed secondary education in 2012 emerging as the second best in the K.C.S.E Exams in my school. I want to study Bachelor of Commerce (BCOM) as I dream of becoming an accountant. In future, am willing to help other needy people in the society without favor irrespective of the community they emerge from. In future, I am ready to hold hands with the Strathmore Fraternity through the KIVA Loan Scheme, to help more students benefit from this noble

This is his story.\nI am Gilbert from Emuhaya district. I come from a family of six children and am the fifth born. My father works as a school grounds man in a Primary school while my mother is a local small scale farmer in Emuhaya district. My father lives in one of the slums in Nairobi. He actually found it difficult to educate the first four children who only got primary school education and due to financial problems their education terminated. I am the only one in our family who has managed to get a University admission. I found it difficult also at secondary school in fees payment of which I was helped by APHIA PLUS, USAID programme.\nI have applied for the KIVA loan for assistance since, I find it difficult to pay tuition fees and would like to pursue my degree in Bachelor of Commerce at Strathmore University. I am grateful to KIVA lenders for believing in me. Once I get quality education, I will be able to help my four siblings who are ahead of me and not employed. I commit to paying back the loan and assisting others in future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1368827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

This is her story.\nI am Stella from in Bungoma County. I come from a family of three and I am the second born. My father works with Water Resources Management Authority while my mother teaches at Teachers Training College. Payment of school fees has been challenging for us with my parents struggling to make ends meet despite my father's sick condition which has proven costly too. I aspire to be a professional actuary and a key volunteer in community projects. I would like to engage in other projects like KIVA with an aim of reducing dependency ratio in the society. I would like to see my dreams become a reality and therefore I requested KIVA lenders to grant me financial aid through a loan to be able to study Actuarial Science at Strathmore University, engage in community service projects and acquire skills in profession building. This loan will enable me fulfill my dreams. I pledge to comply with KIVA terms and conditions and on completion of my studies pay back the loan and be able to aid my family and other needy people in the society.

She loves her work very much.  She tries to help sick people.  She has been working at the hospital for over 15 years.  Her oldest daughter has grown up already, and Tufaniso plans to marry her off.  Everything that she earns goes toward living expenses, and she and her husband just cannot save money.  Tufaniso wants to repair her house because it needs updating, but she does not have enough money for this.  After seeking advice from relatives, she decided to obtain a loan from Arvand.  Tufaniso plans to use this loan to buy construction materials for fixing up the rooms.  She hopes that she will be financially supported at Arvand and helped with realizing her plans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":230.54,"image":{"id":1370131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-20T15:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-20T15:40:11Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tufaniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":37.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":39.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616142,"comment":null},{"amount":36.94,"local_amount":36.94,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":36.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860012,"comment":null},{"amount":37.9,"local_amount":37.9,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":37.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136757,"comment":null},{"amount":38.88,"local_amount":38.88,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":38.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900952,"comment":null},{"amount":39.89,"local_amount":39.89,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":39.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550134,"comment":null},{"amount":40.93,"local_amount":40.93,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774355,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T01:10:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574390,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is a student at Strathmore.

While at secondary school, I portrayed leadership skills where I was a church captain for 3 years and hockey assistant captain where we lead our team to play at provincial level thrice. I believe given an opportunity at Strathmore will manage to do better in such similar fields. It has always been my dream to be an Actuary and help to foster development in our society, by enabling companies and diverse institutions in our growing economy to realise their strengths and weaknesses and thus explore their opportunities and curb their risks. I have wished to pursue my degree in Actuarial Science at Strathmore University but my family financial status does not allow me hence leaving me with KIVA as my only option.

Coming from a single parented household, my mother finds it so hard to pay our school fees but has managed to see me through high school with the little money that she earns and a bit of help from friends and relatives. I have applied for the Kiva loan for assistance since my mother can\u2019t afford to pay for the fees and I would like to pursue my degree in Bachelor of Commerce at Strathmore University. Am so thankful and sincerely feel grateful for the Kiva lenders for considering me and believing in my abilities. Once I get the quality education, I would like to give back to society by helping other needy children to pursue their education and also helping my family members. I commit to paying back the loan fully and comply with the terms and conditions governing Kiva

name is Hellen,I come from Turkana County.I went to Turkana Girls\u2019 Secondary where I managed to get a grade of a B plain. I am the first born of the family of six and I live with my uncle who is a pastor in Lodwar.My  parents divorced when I was only 5years old and because my mother could not provide for me , I had to stay with  my uncle.\r\nWhile at secondary school I could not raise my school fees but because of my commitment to church activities, the church raised my school fees. On completing my secondary level, I had to use the Business skills I got from school to start a small business so that I can help my family. I would buy fish from the fishermen at the shores of lake Turkana, fry them and sell to raise money for my family.\r\nActually after getting my grade I thought my dream of becoming an accountant was shuttered because of lack of money to proceed with my education and also join Strathmore which was the school of my dream. I thank God that though a 2012 KIVA Full tuition beneficiary of KIVA , I got the information that I can follow my dream by getting the loan.\r\nI came to know about Strathmore University through newspapers and magazines. As result and I become so much interested  with  the  high quality of education it gives and I also believed that it is the only place I could achieve my dream of becoming an accountant and also it could be a place that I could acquire life skill and this all is only possible because of KIVA.\r\nI am sure that if I get the KIVA Loan my mind will settle and I will be working very hard at school so that I will get good grades that I can get a good job that will help me give back to my community, help my sibling and also eradicate poverty from Turkana

name is Rebecca from Turkana County, I am a second born in a family of six siblings. I have one sister and four brothers. I have been living with my uncle since I was 7 years, after my parents separated, because I had no one else to take care of me.\r\nI went through my secondary education in Turkana Girls\u2019 Secondary School and I managed to score a mean grade of B+. My school fees were met by Mama Mzungu Foundation, which only offers help to secondary school students only. I was introduced to a KIVA beneficiary from Turkana; she received her full tuition last year and is now an exemplary student at Strathmore. \r\nI chose Strathmore University because it is one of the leading universities in Kenya, offering quality education, and produces the best professionals in the country.  I am interested in pursuing a Bachelor of  Business Information Technology. \r\nGiven the loan to take me through my entire 4-year course, I promise to work very hard to get good grades and after graduating, get a good job, which will empower me to clear the KIVA loan. I also look forward to giving back to the society especially in my home area, Turkana, which is faced by many challenges because it is situated in the arid parts of Kenya.\r\n  \r\n

As a result we have been living under my aunts roof and she has been taking care of us since my mother doesn't have the capability to provide for us because of her sickness. Once I receive the loan and join Strathmore from 1st July 2013, I promise to work very hard and make myself and everybody proud especially my mother. I will also help other students in future and contribute to the growth of our nation and make this world a better place  for the entire human race.\nThank you very

after both of my parents died when I was still at a tender age as well as my twin brother who also passed away earlier than expected making me to remain  a single child in the family to date.\r\n\r\nI hail from a society where education is highly degraded and traditions set in the forefront. This is as characterized by early marriages of girls at premature ages as well as boys due to increased intake of drug substances resulting to their education being held at stake.\r\n\r\nThis is very disheartening and sends a lot of concerns to me as the society continue to derail as young people succumb from the vices. Coming from such a society gives me power and strength that I will prove my critics wrong and give back to the society. I am turning to KIVA for a loan that will enable me  to successfully acquire university education at Strathmore university. Upon completion of my education I strongly believe in giving back to the society by providing moral authority and setting up institutions that will be able to curb such vices amicably and streamline the society.\r\n\r\nI trust that KIVA will make my ambitions come true and will comply with the terms and conditions governing the KIVA loan for the betterment of the institution at large."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":11650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1375842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
