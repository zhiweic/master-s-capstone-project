She completed elementary school and got married at a young age to Rommel, who appears in the photo and is now 30 and works an extended schedule as a security guard.  They have two children, ages 15 and 8.\n\nThey live in Los Bancos, a canton in the province of Pinchincha, one of the largest provinces in the Republic of Ecuador.  This canton is located a few kilometers from the city of Quito and has a variety of forests.  In addition, the people who live in the neighborhoods there are friendly and have traditions typical of this city.  Laura and her family live in an area away from town, on the farm where she also works.\n\nThis canton is in a tropical area so there are farms that produce the tropical fruits that are in most demand in the national and international markets.  This is why Laura started growing cacao five years ago.  She learned the job from several relatives who work in agriculture.  She works at least eight hours a day with the help of her parents-in-law.  The most time-consuming part is harvesting the cacao.  It's a manual task that takes a lot of care because there are risks of getting cut or having an accident when working with a machete.\n\nLaura says she's not making the most of some space on the farm, so she's requesting a loan to start growing new crops, bananas and corn.  These will earn more profits for her as well as help her take steps toward being able, in the future, to buy the land where they grow their crops.\n\nLaura dreams of seeing her children become professionals.  This is why it's so useful for her to have received the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and the Kiva lenders who, even though they're not in her country, contribute to making her dreams come true.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":291.82,"image":{"id":1436624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to grow bananas and corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Los Bancos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-09-23T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-23T21:50:04Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1324.01,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":111.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.84},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.93},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.7,"local_amount":87.63,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T08:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320674,"comment":null},{"amount":101.26,"local_amount":101.18,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856358,"comment":null},{"amount":102.86,"local_amount":102.79,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":102.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995267,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T17:44:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":602038,"name":"And Siggil Hann 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L\u2019Association And Siggil Hann regroupe plusieurs femmes ressortissant de l\u2019une des banlieues Dakaroises.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Learning many new things at school is very interesting for me.\r\n\r\nI joined the student study club. I think that learning together is better than alone. Everything runs well. We stay at an unpretentious house. I know that my parents are not rich and are poor, but I have a dream. My future is better than at present time. I\u2019d like to have a good occupation and a good salary. I can reach them all only with a good education.To all of the kindhearted lenders, I hope that you are willing to help me and my parents. \r\n\r\nMy home town is Cilacap.

Their ages are 24 and 15 years old (me). Only I still carry on studying. This loan can improve my life because with it, I can pay my school fee well. I can concentrate more on my lessons. \r\n\r\nI take computer technics and networking as my majority. I like this because I am taught computer and networking deeply; about the hardware, software and the technology advancement day by day. \r\n\r\nAfter graduation, I\u2019d like to work in a company as a computer administrator\/technician. So far so good, at this school. It\u2019s fun because I have many new friends and new experiences.

I love studying.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

is the story of Gilang, son of Mugiyono:\r\n\r\nMy favourite subject is computers and networking. My reason to choose this vocational study is I want to be a computer expert, especially a programmer. Formerly, it might have been hard for me to make adaptations with new friends and a new environment, but it has not happened for a long time. Now, I am one of them. We know and share each other. Besides that, the teachers are also friendly. \r\n\r\nI am a member of the student football team. I can divide my time between school and after-school activities well. I enjoy playing football with my team, but I do not forget to study every day. \r\n\r\nMy problem at school is about paying the school fee. My parents are poor; it is something difficult for them to do, but they want me to still continue studying to the higher level of education. I beg Kiva lenders, may you help me to give funds for my school fee. My condition will be changed if I get a good occupation. The requirement of getting a good occupation, of course, is good education.\r\n\r\nI live in Persit village, Jeruklegi sub-district, Cilacap Regency. We have a broken soil road along the village to the sub-district. It is a hilly area. The occupation of my father is a walker-seller. He walks door to door to sell his products every day. His salary is around Rp. 300,000 (Indonesian Rupiahs). I am the only child in the family. If I get the funds from Kiva, it will be used to pay my school fee. It also will lighten the financial burden in my family. \r\n\r\nAt school I learn many lessons, for example, English, computer and networking (my vocational majority), chemistry, math, Indonesian language, and so on. I chose the computer and networking because I am interested in computers. Computers are an unseparated thing from the world and human life. Besides that, I want to be a computer programmer. \r\n\r\nSo far, so good, at this school. It\u2019s fun because I have many new friends and new experiences. We talk and share with each other.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school

","en":"Omar, who is 28 years old, is the father of a 7 year old and he lives in a common law marriage with his sweetheart. He was born and raised in the countryside, where his uncle taught him all of the agricultural trades. During his adult life he has worked on various farms and today he is employed by a cattle ranch where he performs the role of steward. He is in charge of all of the animals on the farm, including the milk cows and young calves. He has three cows of his own there because his boss loaned him a small field so that his animals can graze on it and, moreover, his boss offered him the possibility of owning calves to raise. This is the reason why he is seeking this loan. It will be invested in the purchase of 6 young calves for him to raise. This way he will be able to increase his production capacity and to receive additional earnings so that he can pay for the basic expenses and necessities of his home. Omar is a fighter and a vigorous, active and persevering young man. He is always searching for options that will allow him to get his family ahead. This is his primary motivation for getting up to work in the morning each and every day. He also dreams of being the owner of parcel of land where he can keep his animals in the medium term future and through this he will be able to provide his son with a better education and to enjoy a better quality of life and wellbeing. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":196.44,"image":{"id":1438099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 6 calves to raise.

Do\u00f1a Luz es ama de casa y agricultora se dedica espec\u00edficamente al cultivo de caf\u00e9 aunque cultivan el ma\u00edz y frijoles en menor escala. Ella se dedica a esta actividad desde muy ni\u00f1a ya que esta actividad igual que la tierra que trabaja fue heredada por sus padres quienes lucharon para darles una mejor vida. Ella apoya a su esposo en todos los aspectos y actividades que en el campo se realizan pero se involucra m\u00e1s hasta la corta ya que tiene que cuidar a sus dos hijas menores. Ella tiene la facilidad que la tierra est\u00e1 ubicada cerca de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n por lo que puede desplazarse a ella con facilidad para llevar alimentaci\u00f3n a su esposo y cooperar con lo que ella pueda realizar en el momento.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande de Do\u00f1a Luz es que sus hijos logren estudiar hasta la universidad para que tengan un t\u00edtulo con el que se puedan defender en el futuro, adem\u00e1s hacer crecer su negocio y lo lograra d\u00e1ndole mejor mantenimiento a sus cultivos generando ganancias y re invirtiendo en ellas. Por lo que hoy en d\u00eda ella est\u00e1 solicitando a COMIXMUL un financiamiento con el cual comprara insumos agr\u00edcolas para asistir sus cultivos de caf\u00e9 y poder prepararlos para la pr\u00f3xima cosecha. \n","en":"Do\u00f1a Luz is 40-years old.  In her youth, she was able to complete primary school in spite of the few schooling options available back then.  The years went by and she married and had three children, all of whom depend on her and her husband.  The oldest is 16-years old and is in her first year of high school.  The next is 4-years old and will start primary school next year.  The last is 18-months old.  Do\u00f1a Luz is a housewife and a coffee-grower, but she also plants corn and beans on a small scale.  She has made her living in this area since since was a young girl, as this business as well as the land she works were inherited from her parents.  Her parents worked hard to give them a better life.  Do\u00f1a Luz helps her husband in all aspects and activities related to the land, but is more involved until the cutting, as she has to take care of her two younger daughters.  The farmland is located near her home, so she can travel easily between the two to bring her husband his meals and help with whatever she can in the moment. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Luz's greatest dream is that her children are able to study at the university level so that they have a degree with which to hold their own in the future.  In addition, she hopes to grow her business.  She will be able to do so by giving better maintenance to her crop, earning a better profit and re-investing the profit in her business.   And that is why today she is requesting a loan from COMIXMUL.  She will use it to purchase agricultural supplies to help her coffee crop and prepare it for the next harvest.

However, her parents taught her how to work the land at a very young age.

Deysi and her husband decided together to help her mother-in-law by taking her into their home. Deysi\u2019s business consists of growing coffee beans and she is very knowledgeable about the cultivation of this crop. In order to help support her family, she recently started a new project, a small grocery store that is located in her home. Do\u00f1a Deysi\u2019s fields are located close to her house, which is very convenient because at harvest time, she and her husband can work the land themselves. Her clients are buyers who come to her community to buy coffee beans.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Deysi\u2019s biggest dream is for her two children to graduate from school so that they can have a better future, and her biggest goal is to expand her business.

Because of her hard work Nurbubu now has two milk cows, two stallions, four calves, thirteen sheep and also 2.10 hectares of land where she annually grows beans and clover. Her monthly income is 12,000 som. With the goal to further grow her business Nurbubu has come to the Microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 50,000 KGS to buy a milk cow and to increase the headcount of livestock.

The rich soil of the area makes it one of the nation's biggest maize producing regions, lending it the nickname of \u201cthe breadbasket of Kenya.\u201d Once the maize has been harvested from their fields, many farmers grow sunflowers on their land, which is an excellent source of forage for bees. Furthermore, many farmers have started projects planting bluegum trees, which complement the region\u2019s natural forests and provide bees with a variety of food sources. Kitale is located close to Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano that extends into both Uganda and Kenya. The people from around Mount Elgon have been beekeeping for centuries, and the area is dense with strong bee colonies.  \r\n\r\nSusy is married, and has five children, the youngest of whom joined her in attending the Kiva loan meeting and is pictured above.

Founded by European settlers in the early 1900s, Kitale originally grew due to its proximity to the Ugandan railway. The area around Kitale is filled with natural forests, and maintenance of tree cover by the area\u2019s residents has helped both preserve the region\u2019s soil and ensured that the area remains good for beekeeping. Kitale is the headquarters of the Kenya Seed Company, whose massive sunflower plantations provide nearby bees with a veritable buffet of high-quality forage. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is married, and has two children. Her husband works as a business man, while Elizabeth engages in projects on their land. She has been farming for ten years, and is currently growing maize, vegetables and bananas, as well as tending to a tree plantation. She is excited to start beekeeping because not only is it a good source of income, it will also provide her with honey for personal consumption. \r\n\r\nThis is Elizabeth\u2019s first loan with Honey Care, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to educate her children.

Toyunbu has a secondary education. As the primary source of income for her family, Toyunbu practices livestock breeding. She started this business 15 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Toyunbu's hard work, she currently has three milk cows and one horse on her farm. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS).

As the main source of income for her family, Rakhiya practices livestock breeding. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Rakhiya's hard work, she currently has 4 milk cows and 1 calf on her farm. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Rakhiya turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

Thanks to Orunbu's hard work, she currently has three milk cows and 1 horse on her farm. Her monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Orunbu turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to increase the size of her herd.

Her children have grown up a bit, and now Miyansarpocho has some free time. She is not used to wasting time, and has decided to start her own business buying and selling cattle. She is going to run the business out of her home. Miyansarpocho will be able to take care of the children and earn money at the same time. The money her husband sends to her is enough only for food, so she has asked for a loan. She plans on using the loan to buy cattle and feed.

He is married and has four children. In his time, he was able to get a secondary education and even received a university education. Nevertheless, even with a college degree, Ziyoboy was unable to find decent work in his village. By virtue of this, he was forced to take a job as a guard at the local market. At that moment, he did not think about prestige, as he had to feed his children. Ziyoboy's wife also works to help her husband bring earnings home. She works as a cook at a local caf\u00e9. They do not earn a lot of money, but their sons also support them. Two of Ziyoboy's sons are working in Russia and they send their parents a good amount of earnings monthly. \r\n\r\nZiyoboy himself has worked with Microfinance Company Arvand over a period of several years. He has received loans several times to cover his needs and has paid back all of his loan obligations on time. Now Ziyoboy wants to marry off his son, which is why he requires the necessary funds for organizing the wedding ceremony. For this reason, Ziyoboy turned to Microfinance Company Arvand, this time to receive a loan to pay for his son's wedding. He hopes for a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support.

Souad will also buy new cosmetics and home decorating items that will attract customers' attention and increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis is Souad's eighth cycle as an Al Majmoua borrower with good standing and a good paying-back history.

She spends a lot time taking good care of crops and feeding her fish because she wants to ensure high quality production, and thereby generate a better her income than in prior years. Her husband helps her and works closely with these two businesses. \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 1,200,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) from HKL and Kiva. She will use this loan to purchase fertilizers to keep her rice crops in good condition and buy sacks of feed for her fish. She expects that the loan will generate additional income that will enable her to reinvest for the expansion of the farming and fishing business. She believes that, through her perseverance, she will alleviate her family out of poverty and give her children a good quality of life someday."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1419023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizers to keep her rice crops in good condition and buy sacks of feed for her fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chray","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66700},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.68},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.68,"local_amount":66700,"processed_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":68066.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410105421,"comment":null},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":66700,"processed_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T09:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68066.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420254201,"comment":null},{"amount":16.68,"local_amount":66700,"processed_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T16:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":68066.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429518766,"comment":null},{"amount":249.97,"local_amount":999900,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1020389.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439742893,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T02:58:51Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:33:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609003,"name":"Sai Ram Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bissam Cuttack is a small town of the Rayagada district in Odisha, India, where Kumudini, about 48 years old, resides with her husband and four children.

In the year 2011, she formed a JLG with other members of her village to avail loan from Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nKumudini has done tailoring and embroidery work in her house for nine years. She has one tailoring machine. Her younger daughter is helping her in this business. Kumudini and her daughter both know embroidery work. Besides the tailoring work, she makes toys, pillow covers, wall hangings in different designs, TV covers, filter covers, etc. She has a good number of customers. Peoples give orders for wall hangings for their new houses. Kumudini earns about Rs 6,500 in a month. \r\n\r\nHer husband does a private job with a monthly salary. According to Kumudini, this amount is not at all sufficient for her to manage the household expenditure as well as business expenses. So she wants to expand her business to earn some extra income. This will be her second cycle loan. With it she wants to purchase new cloth, threads and one Pico machine. Kumudini has a long desire to have an established cloth store with embroidery at Muniguda and gain name and fame in her locality.\r\n\r\nBesides Kumudini there are five other members in the group. Three members - Ayesha, Bharati and Kalyani -- need a loan for a readymade dress shop, a fast food hotel and a tailoring shop, respectively. The other two members - Prabhati and Jhilli -- both need a loan for leaf plate wholesaling. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase new cloth, threads and one Pico machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bissum Cuttack,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T14:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T14:00:06Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalyani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumudini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prabhati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bharati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayesha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhilli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T02:52:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609027,"name":"Selemane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selemane is 66 years old.

Zarrina worked for several years as a Russian language instructor at a medical college. Now she stays at home and sews and embroiders custom curtains. Zarina's mother taught her this trade. In their family, all of the girls were expert homemakers - they all were expected to know how to sew, cook, clean and manage all of the household tasks. Zarrina's mother raised her well. Four years ago, when Zarrina stopped working and became a homemaker, she was not sad about it because she knew what she would do to support herself. And, believe me, there has not been a day when she has felt sorry for herself. She had no idea that sewing curtains and thinking up different patterns for them would give her such satisfaction. \r\n\r\nZarrina is requesting a loan to purchase a computerized sewing machine. With the assistance of the received credit, she will be able to replace her old machine for a new, computerized sewing machine.

and decent man. He is married and has five children. He lives with his family in a rural village. Kholmirzo has a high school education. In turn, he recently was elected chairman of his local dekhan (group) farms. It has been since 2010 that Kholmirzo has closely cooperated with Arvand. Thanks to the financial support of Arvand, he was able to start his own business, which today brings him a steady income. Kholmirzo is involved in raising livestock and also in agriculture. For this, he has a large plot of land where he grows crops and grazes cattle. Kholmirzo's wife works as a teacher in a local school. She also helps her husband to bring income to the family.

His expenses are much higher then his monthly net income. He has to pay for all the utility bills, electricity bills, gas and water bills alone. Beside all these bills, he has to pay for the children's education fee, and he has to meet other family expenditures alone. However, his monthly income is very low to meet all the expenses. \r\n\r\nHe is planning to add more variety to his shop so that he can increase his selling and net income. However, due to financial constraints he finds it difficult. Therefore, he has requested a Kiva loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a good variety of shoes to sell.

Her husband is a small farmer but also help her with running the business. Mamata\u2019s household income per month is about Rs.6,000 (INR). According to Mamata, this amount is not at all sufficient for her to manage the household expenditures, so she wants to expand her business to earn some extra income.\r\n\r\nShe has already accessed three loans from Mahashakti. This is her fourth cycle loan. From the present loan, she wants to purchase rice, sugar, soap, oil, washing powder, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, dried chilly, and spice powders, etc. for her grocery shop. Mamata has an ambition to educate her sons for a bright career.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group, Bhagabati, Kabita & Joshna, need a loan for a grocery shop, a leaf plate business and a cycle shop respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1433673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"purchase rice, sugar, soap, oil, washing powder, potatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, dried chilly, and spice powders, etc ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KUTRAGADA, RAYAGADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bhagabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T16:59:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609036,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie is aged 37.

Her biggest challenge is 'marketing farm produce.' \r\nAnimals on the farm have been given no names. Marta was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Good loan term.'  \r\nThis client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Low credit cost to enable all to afford.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs.

57 years old. She is a widow. After her husband\u2019s death she has been raising her children and managing her farm on her own. Kulyumkan has completed a technical college. As a main source of income for her family, Kulyumkan raises livestock, having launched this business 37 years ago by buying livestock for 2,000 KGS. Thanks to Kulyumkan\u2019s hard work, her farm today includes one dairy cow, one  mare, and 10 sheep. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Kulyumkan has turned to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan in the amount of 135,000 KGS in order to expand her livestock by buying cattle. Kulyumkan plans to use the resulting revenues for a further increase of her livestock. She also plans to save up for house renovations. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":627.91,"image":{"id":1438528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bala-Sary village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":2775,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulyumkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10592},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9830},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10125},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10428},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10741},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11063},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11395},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11737},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12089},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12452},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12826},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11722}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":217.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":217.72,"local_amount":10592,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10680.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777236,"comment":null},{"amount":202.07,"local_amount":9830,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":9912.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427084,"comment":null},{"amount":208.12,"local_amount":10125,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10209.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942630,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T17:42:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":612023,"name":"San Miguel Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo San Miguel esta haciendo la encuesta de eliminaci\u00f3n de pobreza, como un medio de conocer como esta cada una en los distintos \u00e1mbitos de su vida, donde cada una va mejorando y sabiendo que tiene que trabajar mas, para poder ir mejorando.

Richard. He runs a Zoona Mobile money transfer business in Chililabombwe. This is Richard\u2019s second loan from Kiva; he sent in this update to his Kiva lenders and wanted the lenders to know this about him:\r\n\r\nMy name is Richard, I am widowed and have two lovely daughters and am currently living with one in Chililabombwe in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.\r\nGenerally, I would say my business has not performed as expected. But with the help of the first Kiva loan, I made sure that much of the commissions earned were saved separately. I have since cleared the first loan. From the savings, I managed to pay for the Mobile Booth and got two more operations after an extensive surveying in the Copperbelt Province.\r\nThe greatest challenge I am facing now is the working capital to enable me to operate effectively. It is for this reason that I am applying for the second Kiva loan, so that I can top-up my working Capital to help me serve more customers. One thing I hate is to turn away Customers for the reasons that I do not have enough cash or the banks are closed. I have been with Zoona since 2009 and have helped some to join the business. I look forward to a long sustained relationship with both Kiva and Zoona. I love what I do in my business. That's providing an essential service required for most livelihoods in an easy, fast and safe way, with the advanced technology in the Mobile Business, everything is fascinating to say the least.\r\nHoping and dreaming to expand my business to greater heights, the expansion will help me to improve my family\u2019s standard of living.

Thanks to her hard work, Begaiym's farm now has two milk cows, one calf, five sheep, two lambs, three goats, and five kids. She earns a monthly income of 10,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Begaiym asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 KGS to buy calves for cattle breeding.

Thus, she will be able to obtain the items at a lower cost and will be able to offer a larger variety of products, which will be seen reflected in the increase of the profit margin that she obtains from each sale, giving a higher income level as a result. In this way, she will have the option to improve her personal finances and will avoid depending on her children who have economically collaborated with her for many years.\r\n\r\nCarmen wishes to continue working arduously to arrive at the completion of her dream of accrediting, strengthening, and growing her business to the point of opening more stores, which will generate more profitability and where she would be able to offer business opportunities to more head-of-household women.

She has a small store in her home, where she also offers some products from catalogs for her customers, the majority of whom are her friends, neighbors, and relatives. She also possesses a motorcycle taxi that she rents to a trustworthy person. \r\n\r\nShe has been working all types of jobs for more than 18 years. She has worked alone since her husband makes a living in agriculture and spends much of his time on his farm.  What she likes about her work is that she can make money while being in her home, spending time with her son who on some occasions also goes out to work on the motorcycle taxi that she has. In her neighborhood her grocery store is very crowded since she treats her customers well and has everything they need. She has a good income and it is going well for her in this economic activity.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to later open a business in the sale of motorcycle taxi spare parts and a tire repair shop. This will be her sixth loan with Kiva. Because of this, she is requesting Kiva\u2019s cooperation to be able to concrete her plans. With the amount requested of 600 Nuevo Soles, she will buy food products for her grocery store like rice, sugar, and milk, among others.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":76.92,"image":{"id":1438864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products such as rice, sugar, and milk, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-24T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-24T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":69.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":79.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":84.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.11,"local_amount":64.29,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":66.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353894,"comment":null},{"amount":25.92,"local_amount":69.13,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905676,"comment":null},{"amount":26.89,"local_amount":71.7,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-23T09:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":73.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T19:32:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609111,"name":"Yafesi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yafesi (pictured with his wife) has been a banana farmer since he was a teenager.
