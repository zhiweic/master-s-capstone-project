Nevertheless, he felt that he should work harder in order to achieve his dream.

None of her children liked studying as they preferred to help their parents with the various agricultural activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a housewife and farmer, married with an education up to 5th grade. As a mother, entrepreneur and a hard-worker, she is responsible for her family's well-being and so she decided many years ago to start growing coffee. Although the work is hard and tiring, the rewards are many, working in the right way. Do\u00f1a Gladys also works in business as 10 years ago she implemented a small grocery store which she runs with her children, on occasions sharing the work out, with some in the fields and others in the grocery business. The land they work is their own, and her husband acquired it through a customer many years ago. It is located 40 minutes from their home.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gladys is asking the COMIXMUL cooperative for the loan in order to grow more coffee, and also to use part of it for buying supplies and improving the plantation to ensure the harvest at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nCurrently her aim is to protect their crops, help them and strengthen them so that at the end of the harvest she can get the income she hopes for and be able to pay back the loan. Her dream is to build a road leading to their farmland, making access easier so that her customers can easily come and buy the produce where it is grown.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":157.57,"image":{"id":1465049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to sow more coffee plants and maintain the existing crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"taulabe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-07T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-06T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":157.57,"local_amount":3206.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3217.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T00:57:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629044,"name":"Teresa De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teresa, tiene m\u00e1s demanda de sus productos y necesita comprar camarones frescos, moluscos, conchas y pescados, con esta inversi\u00f3n cumplir\u00e1 con las necesidades de sus clientes, el cr\u00e9dito anterior le ayudo a diversificar los productos, sus ventas fueron mayores, gano nuevos clientes.\nSu econom\u00eda ha mejorado, sigue ampliando su negocio, ha cumplido con el pago de sus cuotas.

always knew he wanted to be his own boss. Years ago, when he became seriously ill, James decided to leave his accounting job and start his own health and life insurance business. With over six years of experience in the industry, James took this opportunity to work in a less stressful environment and pursue his dream.\r\n\r\nNow with two offices, one based out of Clark and one out of Bloomfield, James\u2019s business is thriving. Along with another business partner, who is soon retiring, James works with over 200 commissioned partners in the industry.\r\n\r\nWhen his father passed away two months ago, James took the tragedy, like his previous illness, as an opportunity for change. The funds from this loan will help James\u2019 business move into a new office and help purchase supplies, such as a fax machine, a copier, a computer, desks, and file cabinets. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1463586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase office equipment such as a fax machine, copier, desks, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Clifton","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2013-11-07T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-06T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":6300,"lender_count":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":6300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":314.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":326.21},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.28},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.84},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.29},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":364.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.38},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":314.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":318.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.18},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355.84},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":360.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":364.8},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":369.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":378.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.38},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-26T05:59:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628269,"name":"Khadija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Because Khadija is a conservative woman, she asked her husband to take her place in the picture.

from Thailand to Florida, Timbo says he only planned to be in United States for two years to learn English, but instead, he moved to New Orleans and has lived in the USA for 29 years.\r\n\r\nTimbo first began creating his hand-made, one-of-a-kind macram\u00e9 and beaded accessories after noticing someone else doing it on the side of the street. Knowing he could improve on the different styles he saw, he decided to enter that industry. The business began half-heartedly in 1994. Timbo got tired of it and quit. That was years before Hurricane Katrina.\r\n\r\nJust like many New Orleans\u2019 citizens, Timbo was affected by Hurricane Katrina, which consumed many homes and lives. Left homeless, Timbo lost everything he had worked for to the hurricane. Remembering the work he did when he first migrated to New Orleans, Timbo looked to nonprofit microlender, Accion Texas Inc. for business support.  \r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t hard for him to go back to work, but the Bourbon Street office job wasn\u2019t for him. So he saved enough money to purchase a van, lived in it, and then went to work in the French Market. Only this time, he became serious about his work and took advantage that there wasn\u2019t anyone else doing it.\r\n\r\nHis first loan in 2011 helped purchase inventory as he worked his way out of the van he was living in and into an apartment. Now the business is succeeding and Timbo is saving money to fund his home deposit. \r\n\r\nRecently, Timbo completed the first-time homebuyer course and is working to save money for a deposit on a house. Remembering the passionate work of the Accion employees, Timbo returned for a second loan to purchase inventory, catch up on some bills, and save for working capital when the weather slows traffic on the French Market. \r\n\r\nIf his business continues to be a success, he\u2019ll be able to purchase a home for the first time.\r\n\r\nHe says if he needs additional funding for his business, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back to Accion again. They\u2019re great people, I love them.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":445.54,"image":{"id":1463570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase inventory, pay bills and use for working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"New Orleans, Louisiana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-11-08T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-07T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Timbo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":31,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":148.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":147.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":149.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":153.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":161.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":165.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":168.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":173.46},{"due_date":"2014-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":176.06},{"due_date":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":181.38},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":184.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":186.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":189.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":192.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":195.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":198.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":201.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":204.32},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":207.39},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":210.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":213.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":216.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":220.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":223.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.43},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.88},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.46},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.06},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.38},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.1},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.4},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":296.08,"local_amount":296.08,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":296.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429407345,"comment":null},{"amount":149.46,"local_amount":149.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-22T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439625534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T18:31:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628384,"name":"Crisales","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Crisales works hard to support her family.

Daniel now spends at least two whole days a week selling seafood, mainly when it is market day in the city.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of time, Daniel has gained experience and many regular customers, so now he considers travelling to further places in the mountain region to offer his products.

He is the oldest of three children.  His parents have a drug store and with their savings, they paid for Yamid to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Atlantico, where he got the second highest classification out of the 26 graduates.\r\n\r\nYamid\u2019s dream is to go to Europe to do a Masters in Chemical Engineering.  To be able to do this, he needs Kiva\u2019s help, as it is the only way that he can cover the costs of his language exams, entry tests and university fees.  Once he has completed his Masters and returned to Colombia, he would like to work as a lecturer and researcher, helping to improve the range of high value-added products in the market.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nSince my final year at university, it has been clear in my mind that one of my main aims is to go abroad and do a Masters in Engineering.  I have always stood out academically, but right now I haven\u2019t got the funds to do my TOEFL English exam, GRE General Test or meet other requirements to get a place on a postgraduate course.\r\n\r\nAlthough my parents support my goals, they cannot cover such high costs because of their limited financial position.  Although I am working at the moment as a research assistant for a sustainable Chemical and Biochemical Processes research group, I can only save a small amount of money.  To get the money I need to apply for the course would take me a long time, putting back my dream for at least a year.  Kiva can play an essential role here in allowing me to speed up my application process.  With this support I can complete the Masters and be able to return sooner to contribute to the development of this country.\r\n\r\nMy main motivation for getting a place on a Masters at one of the leading universities in Chemical Engineering is so that I can return to Colombia and contribute to the production of high value-added products.  Colombia is one of the largest producers of commodities in the world, producing and selling great quantities of resources like coal, oil and nickel, among others.  My main aim is to be able to work in engineering research so we can use these raw materials to manufacture products for the electronics industry.  These would generate more profits for the small and medium sized local enterprises favoring a more equitable growth.  As a chemical engineer, I\u2019m convinced that I can contribute to making my country one of the leaders in the field of electronic materials, making use of the potential and the resources that we have at our disposal.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt that investing in human capital can help a nation overcome any situation, a point I would like to prove through my own life experience.  Little by little, by investing in the people who make up society, we can help it progress and move forward.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1465125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay expenses so he can apply for a Masters in Chemical Engineering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-11-08T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-07T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yamid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1896000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158000},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T18:44:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":628439,"name":"Rizalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizalyn is engaged in a hog-raising business.

With profits from her farming she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity.  \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Last year I was lucky to get a scholarship for an exchange year in America. \r\n\r\nHigh school might sometimes be boring, so in order to keep a balance between academics and entertainment, I have been looking for extracurricular activities after classes. I was involved in volunteering and students council. There was an organization where all school leaders participated. It concentrated on public health, environment protection, and local development. I enjoyed organizing all kinds of workshops for school students about health and teenage issues over three years. We also had summer camps. The most exciting project was raising money for local park recreation. \r\n\r\nI was also involved in Student Council as a Minister of Culture and was responsible for every cultural event that took place at school and I got a lot of skills. All the above mentioned will give me a good opportunity to be an active part of social life at the American University of Central Asia. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately my parents can\u2019t afford full tuition at AUCA.
