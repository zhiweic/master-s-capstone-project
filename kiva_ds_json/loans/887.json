One such attraction is the Nazca Lines, which are hieroglyphs that have been drawn across large tracts of arid land.  There are also the pyramids of Cahuachi, the aqueducts of Changuillo, and other archaeological sites that lure hundreds of tourists throughout the year.  This area has developed its agricultural sector, especially the production of corn, prickly pears, carmine dye, cotton, butter beans, fruits, and other commodities.  Whenever Gabriel has a little bit of free time, he enjoys listening to music since it provides a distraction and allows him to relax.  Being a good Peruvian, he enjoys traditional national dishes.  One of his favorite foods is chicken with rice.  With the help of his parents, Gabriel was able to earn a technical degree in Computer Science and Information Systems.  For this reason, his parents are very proud of him.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith great enthusiasm, Gabriel works every day in his film and photography business.  He works approximately five hours each day, but whenever there are school parades or anniversaries taking place in the city, he can work up to 12 hours in a day.

The reason why he is doing well in his business is because he is likeable, provides good service, and above all, is a responsible individual.  \r\n<p>\r\nGabriel is extremely grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to their support, he will be able to set up a photography studio and photo developing room.

has been a client of UGAFODE Microfinance Ltd. for over five cycles. The customer started as a group client and later graduated to borrowing as an individual. He deals in assorted consumer goods and has operated the business for 5 years now. He started the business due to the increased demand for consumer goods in the area. People from his area used to travel for long distances to access these goods so he decided to bring services nearer to them. \r\n\r\nHe started with a small capital of 300,000 UGX and has since grown to serve most of the needs of his customers. Eliezar attributes his success to the small, accessible and convenient loans from UGAFODE Microfinance Ltd. He has been able to care for his family's needs, construct a modest home and pay school fees for his children. (The photo shows Eliezar and his wife in their retail shop.

C\u00e9cile is 42 years old and is married to a driver named Abab\u00e8. The couple has four children, some of whom are in school, and one of whom remains in their care. C\u00e9cile lives with her \u200b\u200bhusband and child. The couple take care of all the various expenses. C\u00e9cile did not go to school. For around eighteen years, C\u00e9cile has been running a business selling various products from her home. Besides this activity, C\u00e9cile also sells balls of corn dough. Thanks to these activities, she is able to support her family without too much difficulty. C\u00e9cile buys her supplies from a city in Benin. In order to better meet the needs of her customers, C\u00e9cile wants to increase her stock and raise the level of her business activity. To do this, C\u00e9cile is seeking her first loan from the microfinance institution ALID\u00e9, together with other members of the JESUWAME 5 group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1124073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy corn and various other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T11:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T11:30:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9cile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabelle","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.05,"local_amount":31800,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":33678.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294273557,"comment":null},{"amount":32.52,"local_amount":15900,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16839.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326558,"comment":null},{"amount":32.52,"local_amount":15900,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16839.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083605,"comment":null},{"amount":32.52,"local_amount":15900,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16839.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315317993,"comment":null},{"amount":28.03,"local_amount":13702,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":14511.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322926569,"comment":null},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":16798,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":17790.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331059487,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T16:37:52Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T11:31:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442386,"name":"Marcial","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcial tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y vive junto a su esposa y a sus cuatro hijos en el sector Muy Finca del distrito de Mochum\u00ed, una zona agr\u00edcola situada en la provincia de Lambayeque, ubicado a una hora y media de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica desde hace mas de doce a\u00f1os a la confecci\u00f3n de vestidos y blusas, confeccionando estas prendas para vend\u00e9rselas a un comerciante mayorista que le hace pedidos por temporadas.

With it, he will buy materials such as leather, leather products, accesories and materials required to make new styles of shoes for women to order. His goal for the future is to improve the structure of his workshop and make it independent from his house. He intends to work hard to take full advantage of his Kiva loan. At present he has a profut margin of 30%, which is very appropriate for this type of business. He wants to increase it with more commercial effort.  ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1126893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy materials such as leather, leather products, accesories and materials required to make new styles.

He is the father of three children, two of whom are still in his care.  Francisco started his business with his own money at the age of 27 because he wanted to work for himself.  This was the first business he ran on his own without support from anybody.  He says that he feels happy in his business because he has regular customers and it is a profitable business which makes daily income.  He is requesting this loan to buy leather, buckles, adhesive and clasps.  These are the raw materials he needs to carry out his work.  He believes that this loan will be helpful as he will be able to increase his production and deliver his work done well and on time.  He will also be able to stock his business with new products which will attract more customers.  Francisco's future plans are to stabilize his small business.

aged 40, is a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Domingo, a driver, and is the mother of their children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMarisol operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. Aside from the store, she also sells fish for additional income. Marisol earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue operating her business, Marisol is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarisol hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to support her children's schooling. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1126225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

However, due to the high unemployment in the country, she has been unable to get a job where she could fully use the education she received. This does not discourage Sandy, who believes that every effort is rewarded and the hardest challenges bring the best rewards. \r\n\r\nAs a child, Sandy learned to weave and embroider. With these skills and her drive to succeed, Sandy and her family decided to start a business selling handicrafts five years ago. Over time, they expanded their business to include the sale of different types of vegetables, and they also raise ducks. \r\n\r\nSandy currently travels to the market three times a week to sell her product. She usually leaves home at 6:30 a.m. and returns at 2 p.m. As her business grew, Sandy saw how she could benefit from a loan and eventually decided to join the Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nSandy explains that as she has diversified the types of products she sells, her customer base has increased. Sandy is about to begin her second loan cycle, and she is planning to use the loan to purchase thread in order to make more embroidered fabrics. In addition, she hopes to buy more food for her ducks. \r\n\r\nSandy is very excited to receive this loan because it gets her one step closer to achieving her dream of running a stable business with consistent revenues, thus giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream of going to college. \r\n\r\nSandy is part of the Mujeres la Bendici\u00f3n de Patzun Trust Bank, with 11 other women who are also working to improve their lives and the lives of their families (among all of them, they have 31 children). During their monthly loan repayment meetings, Sandy and her fellow Trust Bank members participate in educational lessons on business, money management, self-esteem, women\u2019s rights, health and how to support their children\u2019s education. These lessons not only provide the women with valuable information regarding their businesses and their family\u2019s health, but also foster a community of support among the women. Sandy smiles as she says: \"We are thankful for the opportunity of microloans as it helps us to promote our small businesses and improve our quality of life.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1124971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Patzun, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.683333 -91.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Saturnina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandy Jackeline Aracely ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Estela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2377},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2361}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294333446,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301389440,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308148393,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315381474,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988606,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331125054,"comment":null},{"amount":303.38,"local_amount":2377,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2382.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515645,"comment":null},{"amount":301.34,"local_amount":2361,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2366.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067529,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T18:41:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:50:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":441751,"name":"Nonvignon 8 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement NONVIGNON 8 est compos\u00e9 de trente deux personnes qui vivent dans un m\u00eame quartier.

is Jurinda, 37, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Jaime, a driver, and is a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJurinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJurinda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to support her children's schooling.

is Deonila, 61, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Henaro, her business partner. She is a mother to her five children, all of whom are working. She, together with her husband and children, manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their daily expenses.\r\n\r\nDeonila operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Deonila earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDeonila hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1126342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":211.46,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8980.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303356,"comment":null},{"amount":151.04,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6414.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356077,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5131.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114178,"comment":null},{"amount":120.84,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350243,"comment":null},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5131.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959450,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-17T00:16:25Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:46:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442588,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricia is 31 years old, married and has two children.

is Girlie, 34, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Alfredo, her business partner. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGirlie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGirlie hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1126385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-06-26T18:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-26T18:00:15Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Girlie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359524,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5308.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303359,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2123.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301356080,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4247,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114181,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-26T18:51:41Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:19:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442680,"name":"Azzam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Azzam is 61 years old, married, and lives in Tulkarem.

All come from Padre Las Casas, near the city of Temuco.\r\n\r\nJulie, president of the communal bank, is sitting in the front row of the photo in third place from left to right, wearing a purple jacket and with her long dark brown hair worn loose. She has her daughter in her arms. Julie dedicates her time to decorating and engraving glass, which she has done for 9 months. She says she works from home Monday to Friday, arranging her work schedule according to her availability. She buys the items for engraving from wholesale distributors, and decorates, polishes and draws figures on them. She buys at low cost so it makes good economic sense. With the loan she intends to buy glasses and wooden boxes for engraving. Her short term goals are to get people aware of her workshop and her glass engraving. In the medium and long term her goals are to expand her workshop, to generate more income, and with this to obtain a better quality of life. Julie lives with her 2 children: her 18 year old son who is studying and her little girl who is 11 months old. Her dream is to increase her skills in her field and get her work known in the local area and beyond, while creating jobs for others in need. Julie is very happy and grateful for the loan and the service provided by Fondo Esperanza. She also says that she feels very comfortable in meetings of the communal bank, as there is an atmosphere of generosity and unity. \r\n\r\nPadre Las Casas is a community in southern Chile, near the city of Temuco, Araucania region.

Among them they have businesses selling clothes, curtains and sheets, underwear, storage, services and more. All are from the municipality of San Bernardo, located in the city of Santiago. \r\n\r\nDaniela, treasurer of the group, is sitting in the second row of the photo, second from the right, wearing a black shirt with a gray stripe, silver rings and her dark brown hair worn loose. She has been selling pillows and cushions for 1 month. She says that, working with her husband, she makes the cushions and pillows and her husband is responsible for selling them in and around the city. She buys the materials she needs for her cushions and pillows from local distributors and in the city of Santiago, where the low cost of materials means the work makes good economic sense. With the loan she intends to buy sponge, foam, thread and fabric to make pillows and cushions. Her goals are to have her own workshop, with her own sewing machine to generate more income, and thus to have a better quality of life. Daniela lives with her husband, who supports her in her business, and their daughter, who is 3 years old. Her dream for her business is to install a workshop at home. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity from Fondo Esperanza, which allows her to invest in her business. She also says she feels very comfortable in the company of other entrepreneurs in the group, because they do different interesting activities, which are fun. From the training given at meetings, Daniela has learned to manage her business better. \r\n\r\nSan Bernardo is a city located 18 km south of the main square of Santiago (the capital of Chile). It is known as the capital of folklore, because each year, in January, the \"International Folklore Festival\" is held there, and the roots of the country come together and meet musicians from across South America. It also holds the \"Traditional Crafts Fair,\" attended by both artisans from Chile and other nearby countries. In April the \"April cuecas Mil\" event takes place in the city, with the whole community dancing the cueca (a traditional Chilean dance).\r\n\r\n\r\nEste Banco Comunal se llama \u201cLa Vecindad\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 19 emprendedores que se dedican al rubro del comercio, espec\u00edficamente venta de ropa, venta de cortinas y sabanas, venta de ropa interior, almac\u00e9n, servicios entre otros.

is 65 years old. She lives in a small village of Khashuri District with her family: her husband \u2013 Shalva, her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren (13 and 16 years old). Both of the children study in the local school. The family earns its living through agricultural business. They have two milking cows, from whose milk they produce cheese. Part of the cheese is used by the family and the rest is sold locally. Also, they have 2 calves and 5 sheep. The family owns 2 hectares of land as well, where they grow maize and haricots. The family is especially busy with the plot during the spring and summer seasons in order to ensure a good harvest in late summer which they sell on the local open market. Their total average monthly income is 1000 Lari. \r\n\r\nEliko requested a loan for her agricultural business. The family plans to repair the cattle-shed, because the existing one is old. After they repair it, they will be able to keep more livestock there. Also, they will make hay from the mowed grass from their agricultural land to feed the cattle instead of buying it at a high price. Due to the above mentioned, the family will be able to get more milk and increase cheese production. As a result of this Kiva loan, the family\u2019s income will increase, which will enable them to improve their living conditions. Eliko hopes for your help and

","en":"40-year-old Juan comes from Chacaraseca, in Le\u00f3n. He's a Kiva borrower and a farmer. He has been growing vegetables and basic grains for over 10 years. Aside from that, he also raises pigs in order to get another source of income. Juan used the previous loan to buy pigs for raising. It helped him, since he used the profits he got from selling the pigs to cover production costs and to invest in his sesame, yucca and corn crops. Juan currently wants to further diversify his produce with the purpose of satisfying his customers' needs. For that reason he requests a Kiva loan in order to purchase supplies, compost and fertilizer, so that he can invest in growing vegetables and basic grains. He estimates that this new investment will be of help, because he will be able to better maintain his crop, so he can offer quality produce to his customers. His future plans are to keep his business going and to increase his pigs and cattle sales, in order to get higher profits until he can become independent and get ahead."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1127646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Among the myths about this saying, some believe that it is a derivation of the original saying by an Englishman, which was, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London) because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the wintertime, similarly to that of the capital on the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":1127643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy winter seasonal clothing like sweaters, pants, jackets, sweatshirt, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-27T01:20:45Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-27T01:20:45Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":449123,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":20491},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20686},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20884},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":21083},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":21284},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21487},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":21693},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21488},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22486},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":22319},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":22532},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":22747},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":22705},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23409},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":23404},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":23628},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":23853},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":24081},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":24311},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":24552}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.06,"local_amount":20491,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":20820.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430220,"comment":null},{"amount":168.2,"local_amount":83937,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85286.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332999,"comment":null},{"amount":219.38,"local_amount":109473,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111233.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301879020,"comment":null},{"amount":183.14,"local_amount":91393,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":92862.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308147774,"comment":null},{"amount":239.02,"local_amount":119277,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315380931,"comment":null},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":24552,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":24946.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T21:06:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":442962,"name":"Anselma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anselma is 54 years old and lives in Mialen, Clarin.

From the age of 14, he's been involved in agriculture, which he learned from his father.  He used to work 28,000 square meters of land each year, and the yield was quite good, not like currently; he continues working just as hard, but Mother Nature  doesn't give the same yields, due to all the contamination.\r\n\r\nHe keeps working, sowing his corn crops, on his 28,000 square meters of land, and he gets two crops every winter and two more in the summers.  Additionally, he sows about 3,500 square meters of watermelons.  Candido works the land with his kids, who're between 10 and 15 years old, from about 5AM until 2PM every day.  His family members are all modest, good people, and very responsible.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for from the Fundacion Campo, is to buy himself some agricultural inputs in order to sow corn and grow watermelons.  The investment will help him to make his harvest just like every year, giving him enough to sustain his family and enough money to plant his crops the next year.  He wishes to teach his children to work the land so that they can make their own money through humility and hard work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1127706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

de 51 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo al sur de la ciudad  y tiene 2 hijos en las edades de 22 y 26 a\u00f1os. Ella  se dedica a la venta de mercanc\u00edas por cat\u00e1logos o gu\u00edas especializadas a trav\u00e9s de las cuales ofrece sus productos como ropa y calzado en las l\u00edneas  femenina, masculina e infantil. Denis inici\u00f3 su negocio con el \u00e1nimo de generar  ingresos, pues no lograba encontrar un empleo y el trabajo independiente le dio esa posibilidad, a partir de su hoy actividad comercial. Su meta es llegar a ser l\u00edder de zona  y aunque ha estado muy cera de hacerlo, la edad de su madre le ha requerido mucha atenci\u00f3n, pero aun sue\u00f1a con lograr este prop\u00f3sito, porque con esta actividad ha logrado apoyar el bienestar de sus hijos. Su credikiva es su primer financiamiento que solicita a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprara calzado femenino y mercanc\u00eda, que sus cat\u00e1logos exhiben con descuentos especiales y ella quiere impactar a sus clientes con cosm\u00e9ticos, perfumer\u00eda al alcance de su bolsillo y esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual su credikiva se muestra como una inversi\u00f3n exitosa. Su principal meta se dirige  a que sus hijos logren finalizar estudios universitarios, para potencializar su \u00e9xito personal y familiar; as\u00ed  su principal desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente, para responder a una clientela que la espera con la demanda de muchos art\u00edculos, que aunque Denis les vende,   no lo hace de manera oportuna, porque espera recuperar el dinero de sus cuentas por cobrar para dar curso a sus pedidos.   ","en":"Denis is 51 years old. She lives with her husband in the southern part of town, and she has two children aged 22 and 26. She sells merchandise from catalogs or specialized guides through which she offers her products such as women's, men's and children's clothing and shoes. Denis started her business with the drive to get an income, because she wasn't able to find a job. Self-employment made that possible for her through what is currently her business. Her aim is to become the leader of her area and although she has come very close to achieving that, her mother's health has required a lot of attention. However, she still dreams of reaching that goal, because through this business she has been able to support her children's well-being. Her Kiva loan is the first loan she requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase women's shoes and products featured in her catalogs at special discounts. She wants to make an impact on her customers with cosmetics and perfumery they can afford, and that's exactly the reason why her Kiva loan appears to be a successful investment.

In 1996 she launched her business venture, making simple articles of clothing for her friends and family members that she made to measure. They brought her their fabric and supplies. In this way, she only offered sewing services.\r\n\r\nShe gradually perfected her skill and increased her clientele. As well, Gloria began to buy raw materials and to sell amongst her clientele, which increased  each day. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, taking advantage of its sales potential, she added a commercial activity through which she sells products she promotes with specialized catalogs, alternating this activity with her old business of dressmaking.

He opened his workshop in 2000 and he repairs refrigerators here and at the same time sells cold storage equipment to anyone who needs it. He is helped out by one person and his main problem is a lack of funds to be able to respond to customer demand. Since he manages his work well, he is in great demand and for this reason he has approached WAGES for a sixth loan so he can buy cold storage equipment and satisfy his customer demand more easily. It should be noted that he is father to two children who are both at school. The eldest is ten years old and the youngest five; his wife is a seamstress. In the future he wants to expand his business and provide for his children's education.

Velikaya Znamenka in the Zaporozhski region of Ukraine. He started a business with his wife in 2002. In the beginning they were selling plastic sheeting from a truck, then started a market stall where they sold seeds and then finally were able to rent a store space of their own. Currently the two own three stores, one in Velikaya Znamenka and two others in Kamenka. Their store sells agricultural goods and equipment: fertilizer, pesticide, seeds, plastic sheeting for greenhouses etc. Their store is popular and has regular clients. Anatoliy and his wife work hard and because of that are successful. They are not planning to stop and want to always improve and expand their business.\r\n\r\nAnatoliy wants to invest 20,000 griven from Kiva by purchasing additional goods for sale. He has an agricultural degree and a lot of experience in this profession. In the summer season there is a lot of demand for fertilizer and pesticide in the regions, and Anatoliy wants to be sure to buy quality products in sufficient amounts so that his clients have everything they wish to buy on hand.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":1127518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to
