She lives with her husband Jhony and together they have four children, whom she cares for very lovingly. She owns her house, which is located in the town of Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez.\r\nIn the mornings she sells candy in on of her town's schools. She uses a tricycle in the schoolyard of that institution. She's already been in this business for two years and, according to her, it's going very well, since she always sells an average of 70 nuevos soles. From that amount she needs to draw the expenses invested in merchandise as well as the daily payment to the school for the right to sell. In addition, her husband works in a farm cutting pasture for the animals, and he receives a monthly salary for that. However, on Saturdays and Sundays he drives the three-wheeler they purchased a few years ago and transports passengers, which gets them some extra money for the household. Now they need to repair their vehicle in order to keep working as usual.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she gives thanks for the support she's gotten. She joined her communal bank by invitation from one of the older members. She's sure that the financial support she'll receive will allow her to increase her profits, which will be used to improve her business. For that reason she pledges to be punctual with her repayments.\r\nBertha will use the requested amount to purchase new tires for her three-wheeler, and with the rest of the money she will buy

He lives in the city of Pisco and has 2 children who have been his motivation and reason to press forward and struggle so that they become good men. Unfortunately for various reasons he separated from his wife some years ago. Alejandro has always been a very happy, hard-working and enthusiastic person. Sadly, when he was very young he lost his parents. Since then, due to the need of work and to afford his expenses he could not pursue a professional career, but he would have liked to study mechanical engineering. In his free time he likes to dedicate a little time to sports and on some occasions cook a delicious rice with duck to share with his family.\r\n\r\nThanks to his entrepreneurial spirit and good lessons from his father, Alejandro for some years has run his small garage painting cars. He works about 11 hours daily, during which he can attend to up to 5 customers. Alejandro is very happy doing his work and believes that his business is doing well due to his clients recommending him for his good work and for his kind and respectful treatment.\r\n\r\nAlejandro is very grateful to the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the help provided he will be able to purchase welding and renovation materials such as: paint, paint gun, sand paper, paint thinner, varnishes among others. In this way, Alejandro would have his business better conditioned with adequate materials to do his jobs. In this way he will be able to increase his sales and economic income, with which he wants to be able to give his housing the finishes it requires and in the not too distant future he hopes to be able to have another shop for painting cars that he can manage.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1131875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy materials welding and renovation materials such as: paint, paint gun, sand paper, paint thinner, varnishes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro Nicanor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":203.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":207.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":215.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":227.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":232.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":244.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":251.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":275.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":282.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":293.85},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":304.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":447147,"name":"Phocas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phocas is married with six children.

Through this work she will generate resources in order to support her family, as she is married and has 4 children.\r\n\r\nWhen she was asked what she like about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the health training."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":1131872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeraldin Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14141.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1414.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":615,"local_amount":4242.42,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441325,"comment":null},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301495264,"comment":null},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308260808,"comment":null},{"amount":410,"local_amount":2828.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2853.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315490518,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":1414.14,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1426.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323095377,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-13T00:38:30Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":445690,"name":"Isidro Danilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Isidro Danilo de 57 a\u00f1os de edad del departamento de chinandega con 5 hijos, se dedica a la actividad de reparacion de calzado (zapatero) , esta solicitando para hacerle mejoras a a su casa de habitacion  como costruir la sala , con el financiamiento comprar material de construccion como:  zinc, arena, cemento, cal, clavos, alambre, entre otros, el brinda las gracias a leon 2000 y el proyecto kiva  por brindarle el apoyo que necesita para mejorar sus condiciones de vida.","en":"Isidro Danilo is 57 years old and from the Chinandega department.

is 26 and has been married for more than six years. She and her husband have two children, all of whom are in school. Mwanashabani operates a tailoring business in Likoni, a small town in the city of Mombasa. She has operated this business for four years. She started her business, because she studied tailoring and dress-making before she started working. She greatly enjoys tending to her clients, so she decided to open her own tailoring shop. She is now requesting a loan for the purchase of clothing materials and thread. These are the items that she uses the most in her tailoring.\n\nMwanashabani and her husband, Salim, are very grateful to the microfinance institution, because if things keep going as they have been, the quality of everything in the tailoring shop will increase. This makes them very happy, because their children will not have to go without education in the future. Currently, they live in their own house that has piped water but no electricity, though they hope to have this amenity very soon.

","en":"Ana is a humble woman who lives in Le\u00f3n. She is 47 years old and has two children. She is a Kiva client who, as a trader, has been selling tortillas since she was 26 years old.  Ana says that her first loan was a great help as she was able to invest in her business. In addition to the profit that she made, she succeeded in improving the conditions of her business premises. She used the loan to buy corn and firewood to make tortillas. However, she would like to diversify further in products offered by her business, as demand is high. That is why she now needs a loan, like the previous one, to buy corn and firewood for her business, because products are going up in price and she needs to be prepared for the rainy season. She considers that this new investment will help because she can buy the raw materials required for the business, and she will be able to meet the needs of her customers. Ana says that her next step is to buy zinc and corn to put aside for use during difficult times. She hopes to have the support of Kiva to allow her to continue with her work, since it is something that she loves doing and that has enabled her to get on in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1131882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy corn and firewood.

Before this, he used to work as a driver. All of his children moved out from their parent\u2019s house. Now he lives with his wife and nephew in Kherlen, an eastern boundary town in Mongolia. One of his daughters lives in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Recently, his daughter purchased a plot of land and an old house in the 'ger' district (ger is a Mongolian nomadic tent).  The house needed a complete renovation or repair. Especially, she is planning to replace its windows to double-glazed ones first due to too much heat loss and emissions through the old ones.  But she lacks money to cover the cost of new windows. \n\nHer father Beezandan decided to help his daughter to repair her home. She believes her house will become warmer and the cost of coal will be cut notably. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is a main reason of Mongolia's air pollution. \n\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and to buy the cars running on natural gas. The loan Beezandan is taking will be used to cover the cost of the new double-glazed windows for his daughter\u2019s house.

is Weldita, 51, resident of Cavite, Philippines. She has one child. She manages their household while operating a business.\r\n\r\nWeldita runs a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Gemma buys products at wholesale prices and sells them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She brings in a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory, and to service her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nWeldita hopes to expand her business through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Melody makes a profit by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually at retail prices. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to run her business, Melody is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and to maintain her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMelody hopes her business will grow into a mini grocery store and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education due to her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda are under-served by financial institutions.

Byambadorj is 25 years old and lives with his wife in an old house which is in need of repair. He works as a vendor in a local store, and is requesting a loan to repair his home, which is located in the ger (or traditional Mongolian yurt) district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. He will use his loan to buy the materials he needs to replace his home's heater, old wooden floor and windows, and install insulation to reduce heat loss. In the winter, he uses a water-heated furnace to stay warm, and it costs too much and wastes a lot of water. By replacing it, he will lower his bills and improve the environment. \r\n  \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the globe's most polluted countries. This is due to the long, cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities, and it frequently snows. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from people just trying to stay warm. Extremely toxic smoke from cars is another cause of air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to its clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and run cars on the natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and on Mongolians' health.

He previously worked as a fireman in the emergency bureau for many years, but he decided to start his business due to the low salary. His wife is unemployed and she stays at home. His business has been a main income source of his family for years.

Now he needs MNT 1,950,000 to cover the remaining cost of purchasing his car. \r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Also, the extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons Mongolia has hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and allows them to buy cars that run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will be used to cover the cost of purchasing a natural gas-engine car. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":887.1,"image":{"id":1134941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to cover the cost of purchasing a natural gas-engine car.

is 39 years old and he lives with his wife and 2 daughters in a rental apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He runs a small construction company and has been working since 2009. He hires a few builders and pays their benefits from his profits as he can. His company has done many external and internal building jobs since it was established 3 years ago. \r\nHis renting apartment is bad, small, and uncomfortable, so he has decided to build his family a house in the ger district (a ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) in the city area. It will have a foam insulation wall. He thinks this will reduce the heat loss and emissions and won\u2019t use much coal fuel.  Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Also, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main causes of Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and enables them to buy cars which run on natural gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Batsuren is taking will used to buy wall insulation materials such as the foam boards, rock wool, and bricks. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":1134944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy wall insulation materials such as foam boards, rock wool, and bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-07-10T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-09T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batsuren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1165666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1190338.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1235839.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1408156.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":880.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":898.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":933.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1063.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":880.08,"local_amount":1165666.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1169184.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301369485,"comment":null},{"amount":2894.92,"local_amount":3834333.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3845903.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308129251,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-14T08:21:11Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446794,"name":"Katerina","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041a\u0418\u0412\u0410. \u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430. \n\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 9 000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b: 50 \u043f\u0430\u0440 \u0448\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432, 70 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a. \n","en":"This is not Katerina's first time using Kiva's lending services.

A few years ago, he got his friend's car, who loaned it to him so that he could work with it and make a profit out of it. That is why, from the break of day until sundown, he goes out to the city streets to provide taxi services. It is going very well, because he earns an income every day, and during the holiday season he obtains higher profits because there is little mobility and, as a good worker, he knows how to make the most of those opportunities.

The walk doesn\u2019t bother her but she takes advantage of this and takes her animals.  She has sheep, donkeys, pigs, chickens, and Guinea pigs.  She uses the last three kinds for personal consumption and she raises them in her home.  She takes each harvest to the city where she receives a greater income.  Now she would like to save all the money she can because she wants to buy a house where she can start a prepared food business.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan through MFP and she appreciates the financial support that she gets, as it will allow her to solidify her business objectives.

Thanks to her parents' support, who have always been by her side, she was able to go to culinary school. In her free time, she enjoys watching educational programs on television and sometimes she likes to prepare Chinese food to share with her family.\r\nWith a lot of perseverance, enthusiasm, and thanks to her parents' support, Martha started her small business. She sells groceries at home and dedicates about ten hours of work a day to her business. She is confortable with her work because it allows her to cover her expenses and help her parents. Martha believes her business is going well because her prices are good and she treats others kindly.\r\nMartha is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help they offer, she will be able to purchase merchandise for her business, such as rice, sugar, legumes, milk, oil, drinks, beer, and other items. This will allow Martha to have a better-stocked business and, in turn, increase her sales and her income, which she hopes to use to expand her business by selling breakfasts so that, in the near future, she can make her greatest dream come true, which is to open her own restaurant."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1132675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

This allows her to support her household which consists of her husband, who is also an entrepreneur, and their children who are 24 and 19 years old.  She dreams of seeing her children become successful professionals.  Luz Mery started her business 10 years ago when a cosmetics consultant who sold products through specialized guides introduced her to her catalog and she started selling goods to a market consisting of neighbors, relatives and close friends.  Her efforts in promoting and selling her products, and recouping her investment, were very soon rewarded as her business grew.  She is now a product director and leads a group of more than 60 women who sell cosmetics, ladies' accessories and perfumes.  She has earned prizes and has invested a lot in the products that the catalog promotes with discounts.  As a result, five years ago she was able to buy a display case and shelving which she set up in her own home, turning it into a sales location.  Things have gone very well and she has managed to start selling additional products which she buys because her customers request them.\r\n\r\nWhen Luz Mery bought a computer for her family, her neighbors and customers would ask to borrow it or ask her to type letters and general memos.  She saw a potential for making income and added a transcription and photocopying service to her business.  This has also done very well and Luz Mery's biggest goal is now to grow her micro-business.  In order to achieve her goal, she gets up every morning and puts all her efforts into her work.  Her main challenge is not having enough working capital to invest in her business as she makes most of her sales on credit.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use her loan to buy a printer, a display case and general merchandise such as perfumes and cosmetics.  This investment will improve her income and she will gradually manage to fulfill her dream of seeing her son finish

This means that Xochilt loses profits and time.  She decided to start this business in order to help her husband with their household expenses so that, between the two of them, they could offer their children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nXochilt believes herself to be a special person because she really enjoys improving herself and overcoming obstacles and barriers that she finds in her path.

Its twelve members are all women from a beautiful town called Pinotepa Nacional in Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Herminia, better known as Hino.  She is 66 years old and has been selling tamales, hand-made tortillas and 'sopes' (fried tortillas topped with beans and sauce) for 23 years.  She started working when she was very young because her parents didn't have too many financial opportunities and they didn't make enough income to feed her brothers and sisters.  Hino set out selling 'empanadas de leche' (plantain dumplings stuffed with milk pudding) and other sweet treats.  However, this didn't make her enough profits and so she decided to start selling hand-made tortillas.  This business proved profitable.  Over time, her customers started asking her to sell tamales as well.  Although Hino didn't know whether this typical Mexican dish would sell well, she took the risk as she has always liked to do.\r\n\r\nHino says that what she most enjoys about her business is making her tamales because she discovered that she makes them with good flavor.  She would like to make the most of this gift and keep working.  Above all, she would like to make the most of the opportunities that her customers give her to keep selling her products.  Her customers recommend her because of the service that she provides.  Despite the fact that she lost her husband 20 years ago and needed to work harder in order to feed her family, Hino says that it wasn't so difficult because she really enjoys working.  In addition, she says that she has always made the most of all the opportunities open to her.  In the past she has worked as a farm laborer and also as a fisherwoman in order to provide her three children with a good education.  Hino requested this loan to buy ingredients with which to make her tamales.  She also bought corn and logs.  Hino would like to send everybody a message: \"Make the most of all the opportunities that present themselves in life as they don't always appear\".\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are:\r\nMar\u00eda Antonieta -

Su meta es adecuar la infraestructura de su negocio, pues los espacios donde habita y funciona este negocio no son suficientes para su familia, debido a que su negocio se le ha crecido. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente, para lograr su sue\u00f1o  y por eso debe hacer crecer su negocio, trabajando en su mercado mas efectivamente, organizando sus compras y buscando mejores alternativas entre sus proveedores. En la actualidad Yaleidis est\u00e1 aplicando un credikiva, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas  e insumos, como arroz por bultos, aceite  y  harinas,  los cuales requiere para su producci\u00f3n y teniendo inventarios, disminuir\u00eda los costos del transporte, ahorrar\u00eda en los precios por compras por mayor volumen y esto es justamente lo que potencializa el \u00e9xito de su inversi\u00f3n. ","en":"Yaleidis, 35, lives with her partner and their two children, 11- and 3-years old, respectively.  They live in Cartagena de India, a beautiful city on Colombia's Caribbean coast.  The city is one of the country's loveliest and best-known tourist spots and the home of one of its largest naval bases.  Its historic-artistic heritage has come down to the city from older ones--Carthage, Rome, Byzantium--and the old mixes beautifully with the new.  Yaleidis operates her restaurant business here, in this perfect place.  She makes and sells prepared meals, mostly for the day laborers, construction workers, etc. who work in the area.  She sells on credit and collects from her customer once a week.  She wants to improve the space where she works because she operates the business in her house and there's not enough room for both the business and her family.  She is applying for a loan because she doesn't have enough working capital to carry out the improvements.  Yaleidis will use your Kiva loan to buy the basic supplies--rice, cooking oil, flour, etc.--she needs to continue her business.  The investment will allow her to reduce her transportation costs and buy wholesale supplies of everything she needs at a lower cost than she would otherwise have to pay.

It's one of the most beautiful and well-known tourist sites in Colombia, because it has one of the most important naval bases in the country and also because of its historic and artistic heritage. This includes remains from the Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine periods, military buildings of the modern and contemporary age, as well as neoclassical and modernist buildings. This charming town is the setting where she leads a modest life and runs her business. It's a store where she sells stationery items, products for women and for the household, and various merchandise she gradually added according to her customers' demands. She's been building a clientele for the past three years, ever since she became unemployed and decided to start this business so she could get an income to contribute to the welfare of her household. At first she offered phone and cell phone calling services, and later on she added oats in glass jars, candy, pastries and industrially processed foodstuffs. Finally, she added stationery items, accessories, home products and everything else her customers demanded. Her business sense has steered her favorably, since she has taken very good advantage of the opportunities provided by the market. Her main customers are the students of the schools located near her business. Her goal is to keep on expanding her clientele, but her biggest challenge is not having enough working capital for that. That's the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, which she will use to purchase stationery, school supplies, toiletries and herbal medicine. With this investment she intends to increase her sales potential and obtain new profits, which will very much help her achieve her dream of improving her family's well-being more and more."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1132776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase stationery, school supplies, toiletries and herbal medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-11T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-10T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bererna Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72790},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82189},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84107},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86069},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88077},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90132},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92235},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94388},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96590},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98844},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101150},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":113429}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":72790,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":73472.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395510,"comment":null},{"amount":46.7,"local_amount":82189,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":82959.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775296,"comment":null},{"amount":47.79,"local_amount":84107,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84895.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519360,"comment":null},{"amount":489.15,"local_amount":860914,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":868985.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-09T23:23:27Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446179,"name":"Nestor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nestor es una persona muy trabajadora que siempre se ha caracterizado por querer dar en su familia una mejor calidad de vida y progresar econ\u00f3micamente, para esto trabaja fuertemente en su negocio desde hace 8 a\u00f1os el cual es la fotograf\u00eda y donde ofrece a sus clientes los servicios de primeras comuniones, matrimonios, eventos especiales, entre otros m\u00e1s.

He says the dairy cow will improve his family upkeep and earn more income to educate his children.  He plans to expand his carpentry workshop and dairy business.  He adds that the currently products yields, especially that of maize, are too low to meet his family's needs, and calls for diversification as well as expansion for a more productive dairy
