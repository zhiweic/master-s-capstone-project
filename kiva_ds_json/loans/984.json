She is a 55-year-old married mother of nine children, one (a son) of whom is dependent on her and currently in school. To make a living, Sok works as a rice famer on two hectares of farmland and her husband complements the income by working as a Tuk-Tuk taxi driver. She has been involved in her rice farming business for 32 years, earning approximately 25,000 KHR per day. She has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles already. These loans help her to meet her family\u2019s needs. She is now leading a group of three female members to apply for a loan of 2,200,000 KHR in total. With her loan of 1,000,000 KHR, Sok will spend a portion of it to buy fertilizers to apply to her farmland and the other portion of it will be used to repair her husband\u2019s Tuk-Tuk (motorized rickshaw). In the future, she would like to see growth in her business.

For over 10 years, he has been working in animal husbandry and currently has 5 cows and 6 sheep. He spends several months raising cattle, then sells them at a market where he has many clients.

are for a kind-hearted woman named Rafoat. She is 50 years old and married. She has 3 adult children who now have their own families that get larger every year; however, their house is small and lacks adequate conditions.

Drought is the main challenge to her farm work.\r\n<p>\r\nSophea\u2019s group consists of five female members who live in the same village. This will be her first loan with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. As leader of her group, she is applying for a loan that will come to 1,000,000 KHR each. \r\n<p>\r\nSophea is going to use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer and pay for laborers\u2019 fees for her farm. She hopes her crop yield will become more profitable so as to make a better living and keep her child in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1219771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and pay for laborers\u2019 fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Prey Chhor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-11-02T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-02T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":3600000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3628786.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197557,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":100799.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841569,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":201599.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046831,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":302398.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837993,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":806396.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410225328,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T17:30:41Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:16:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":486338,"name":"Yen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yen is 45 and is married with six children.

Several years ago her parents went into debt when they purchased their home and three years ago Ninoska's mother had a stroke.   Therefore all of her father's income has been used to care for her mother, and the debt was put into Ninoska's name so she is now covering payment.\r\n\r\nHer work consists of handling legal transactions, transfer of property titles, transit and mortgage tax services and everything related to legal paperwork.  She is studying law which has given her the knowledge she needs to do her work, but says where she learns more through hands-on transactions and legal action.  Unfortunately, her mother is still ill and the doctors have recommended that she live somewhere such as Cochabamba.  She has blood pressure problems and the altitude of La Paz makes them worse.  Ninoska travels on weekends to see her mother and help out with related expenses.

She is also the mother of four children, one of whom (her daughter) is still her responsibility. Having been a teacher for 21 years, Rong earns around 22,000 KHR per day. To increase her family's income, Rong\u2019s husband works as a rice farmer on 3.5 hectares of farmland. Due to insects, the crops were of low quality. This low quality forced Rong\u2019s husband to sell the crop for lower prices than usual. As a result, the family's income declined, motivating Rong to request her first loan from VisionFund to buy pesticides for her husband\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nThe first loan has improved the quality of the crops. Now, Rong is in need of more money to buy more fertilizer to improve crop yield, which will allow her husband to sell the crops at a higher price. Therefore, she decided to request another loan after the first loan ended. Because of her good performance during the first loan cycle, Rong was appointed to be a group leader. With her group member, she is applying for a loan in the amount of 1,700,000 KHR in total. After receiving her loan portion and using it wisely, Rong hopes that her husband\u2019s rice-farming business, which forms a big part of the family\u2019s income, will provide him with better quality crop yields.

She has wisely used the past loans to relieve her family\u2019s burden. Now, Roen and her group member are applying for a loan of 1,000,000 KHR each. As the leader, she wants to use a portion to buy fertilizer and rice seeds for her farm. With this loan, Roen hopes to get a high yield from her rice-farming business so she can improve her family's living conditions.

Some of her children are students while others are employed as rice farmers. To support her family, she has grown rice and raised pigs for more than 25 years, earning approximately 14,000 KHR per day and managing to save around 6,000 KHR after living costs. \r\n\r\nRecently, Savy's business has faced some challenges, such as unhealthy pigs and the lack of pig feed, leading her to request her first loan from VisionFund, Kiva\u2019s partner. Thus, she is now requesting a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 KHR. With a portion of this loan, Savy will buy feed for her pigs.

She sells for cash or on credit to a retail customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nBintou is expecting average monthly profits from this loan to reach 45,000 CFA francs.  These profits will be used in part to pay off her loan's interest.  She will reinvest the rest of the money in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1229605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy various goods (pagnes, earrings and shoes).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-03T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-03T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243392,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243393,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624971,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922672,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922673,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636211,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029763,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819352,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678258,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":30429.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399923989,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-10T17:42:34Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":488239,"name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Los Tres \u00c1ngeles se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en el Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

He is a rural citizen from the Moung Russey district of Battambang Province, Cambordia.  He has three hectares for growing rice, the business that he has been with for 10 years.  This is the fifth time that Samphors borrows with Kiva's partner, VisionFund.  He has managed his loan wisely in upgrading his living condition better than before.

She works at the city health center as a family doctor.  She has been a client of MDO Arvand since December 2011.  The first time she took out a loan was for her children's education.  According to Muharramjon, she is very pleased that it is possible to take out a loan to help realize one's plans.  Since she is educated and works in a professional capacity, Muharramjon has always dreamed of being able to give her children an education so they would not have difficulty with work.  She is asking for another loan to pay for her children's education.  Muharramjon is very glad that with the help of these organizations, people can achieve their

very good and hard-working woman.  The home in which she lives with her family is in a poor condition and urgently needs repairs.  Alfimo is 38 years old and is married with six children at home.  Her children are aged 18, 15, 13, 9, 3 and 2.  They attend school and are always asking their parents to fix their house, but the income of Alfimo and her husband does not allow for this.  She needs to replace the windows and doors, as they are not able to keep the house warm during the winters, which can get very cold in Tajikistan.  Because of the discomfort of their home, the children always have colds in the winter.  Alfimo is asking for a loan of 4,000 somoni to buy building materials and windows to repair her home.  Alfimo and her children will wait until kind creditors help them solve the problems of their home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":624.45,"image":{"id":1229530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

conditions and a small salary, but her heart is kind and her temper is good.  She is Ugulsapar from Tajikistan.  She is 37 years old and is married with four children at home.  For more than 10 years, she has been involved in raising crops like potatoes, wheat, carrots, etc.  She sells her crops in the market.  Because she has good quality produce, her goods are in high demand.  Her husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation and Ugulsapar takes care of the family and runs the business herself.  With the goal of providing for her family's needs, she wants to increase her business, so she will need higher crop yields.
