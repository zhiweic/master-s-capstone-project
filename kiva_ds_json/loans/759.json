The main activity of her family is fattening and reselling of cattle. Having started already in 1993 with as sum of 20,000 som (KGS), the farm now brings in around 7,000 som (KGS) per month. Currently Guldarbubu's farm has one dairy cow and ten sheep. \r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing the number of cattle, Guldarbubu turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional cattle. This will enable Guldarbubu to enlarge her farm, and according to opinion this it a very good investment.

to heat her greenhouse and add a double layer of plastic sheeting as additional insurance against a freeze.  This way she can start selling earlier in the year for better prices.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her previous loan which allowed her to build an additional greenhouse, Raisa now has five greenhouses. \r\n\r\nLast summer, at the end of the season, Raisa divorced her husband. Because of this, she had to run the entire business herself. It was hard, and therefore she received less income than the previous year. But Raisa has an adult son who helps his mother on the farm. Raisa takes care of her elderly parents who live with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":641432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to heat her greenhouse and add a double layer of plastic sheeting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T20:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8500},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1062.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-08T08:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8546.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518648,"comment":null},{"amount":1062.5,"local_amount":8500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8546.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594598,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T00:42:27Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:50:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381890,"name":"Srun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srun is a 26-year-old mother of two who lives in the Prey Chor district.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rufina earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rufina is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. Rufina expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRufina hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she fervently hopes that her family has a better future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

He and his children live with his paternal family and other households. He left school at secondary level (in the Malian education system) and started working in the diesel retail business with his uncle at an early age. After working for several years as an apprentice, he started his own diesel oil retail business. Today he is a seasoned reseller with 10 years of experience in the field. His high sales volume is due to his good understanding of how the sector works. He sells his merchandise for cash to a clientele which is mostly composed of drivers and resellers.\r\n\r\nBakary is requesting a new loan in order to be able to keep up with customer demand and increase his profits. He has been with Soro Yiriwaso for 36 months and has already fully repaid 3 previous loans. This will be his 4th individual loan, which he plans to use to buy 4 barrels of diesel oil. He gets his supplies on the spot.\r\n\r\nBakary predicts a monthly profit of 150 000 francs. His profits will allow him to repay his loan and engage in other profit-making activities.

She spent 35 years working as a primary grades teacher and is known as a very goal-oriented, responsible and hardworking person.  Jumabubu was able to pass her love of knowledge onto her children, who obtained higher education degrees in the fields of medicine, engineering and linguistics.  Obtaining education became possible thanks to Jumabubu's family's primary business, which is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1990 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS), today yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Jumabubu's business has 4 dairy cows, 15 heads of sheep, and 9 heads of goats.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Jumabubu requested a loan in the sum of 133,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional livestock.  This will allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, in her opinion, making the best investment of capital.  In the future, Jumabubu wants to build a large house for her

He is a polygamist, and he has two wives and eleven children. His family lives in Hamdallaye, a working-class neighborhood in the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, after having pursued several business activities unsuccessfully, Souleymane began buying and selling firewood. He buys the firewood in Denderso and its surrounding areas. He is in very high demand thanks to the quality of his product.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his ever-growing customer base, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is his second individual loan through Soro Yiriwaso. His first loan was repaid properly.\r\n\r\nWith this second loan, he plans to buy five truckloads (10 tonnes) of firewood.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to achieve monthly profits of 175,000 FCFA, which will mainly the used to cover family expenses and pay the interest of his loan.

His customers are composed generally of farmers, gardeners, etc. Some of his customers pay in cash, others on credit. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Zoubairou envisions making a monthly profit of 200,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to help with family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":985042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy various farming supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T03:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoubairou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424839,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140103,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-21T08:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757070,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251830,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410831,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448979,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502744,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268422,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498836,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102887,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T22:04:31Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":381986,"name":"Philomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philomena, a mother of one child, is married to Emmanuel who helps her support the family.

He was accepted to the Yerevan Zoo Veterinary Institute after finishing a village secondary school.  Yervand is married and has two sons.  Both of his sons live in Yerevan and work as rescuers for the MES (Ministry of Emergency Situations).  Yervand's wife works as an Armenian language teacher at a secondary school, and Yervand works as a secretary at the village administration office.  Yervand has been involved in agriculture in the Aghvani village since 1998.  He grows potatoes and beans for sale on his plot of land.  He also keeps bees and sells honey in the city of Kapan.  Yervand says that beekeeping is a fairly difficult business, but it brings in a good income, and this is why he wants to increase the quantity of beehives.  Thanks to his agricultural business, Yervand supports his family because salaries are often not large enough to provide the family with all of the necessities.  Yervand needs a loan in the sum of 300,000 dram to purchase 6 new beehives and also to purchase frames for honey, wax and new speciality clothing for the beekeeping business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":985085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con la cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor cantidad, v\u00edveres, refrescos, \u00fatiles de aseo y papeler\u00eda, que es lo que usualmente solicitan sus clientes en esta primera temporada escolar del a\u00f1o.  Su meta es tener una casa para adecuar su negocio con toda la tecnolog\u00eda y modernidad de su juventud. Mientras esto  ocurre se esmera trabajando y con ello obtiene una rentabilidad promedia sobre las ventas, no menor del 28%, sus inventarios rotan cada 14 d\u00edas y sus cuentas por cobrar cada 5 d\u00edas, porque la mayor cantidad de art\u00edculos los vende de contado y maneja unos pocos cr\u00e9ditos con clientes rentables, con los cuales sostiene buenas relaciones. \n\n\n","en":"Nevys, while still a young woman of 19, already has her own business.  When she was 14, she decided to become a retailer, and had two initial experiences which led her to undertake her business venture of a store.  Today her store sells food, personal grooming products, and in general all the specific items a family needs.  She sells to housewives who meet together, chat and make their purchases at Nevys' store.\r\n\r\nNevys is an entrepreneurial young woman who generates income through her initiative.  She has managed to move ahead in life in spite of being orphaned, and so has supported her family and managed to keep her business going.  She plans to see it grow permanently, and for this reason she works on a daily basis with maximum determination.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she has come for a Kiva loan; her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, she will purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products, and paper goods, which are what her customers normally look for at this first school season of  the year.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a house where she can use all the technology and modernity of her youth in her business.  In the meantime, she strives to work, and with her work she earns an average profit on her sales of not less than 28%, her inventory turns over every two weeks. and her accounts receivables is at 5 days.  This is because she sells the great majority of items for cash, and provides credit to only a few, profitable customers with whom she has good relations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":985247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products and paper goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nevys Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166546},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":172096},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176112},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180221},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":184426},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":190599}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.39,"local_amount":166546,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":171501.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325111,"comment":null},{"amount":96.5,"local_amount":172096,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":177217.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039170,"comment":null},{"amount":98.76,"local_amount":176112,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":181352.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651303,"comment":null},{"amount":101.06,"local_amount":180221,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":185583.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140911,"comment":null},{"amount":210.29,"local_amount":375025,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":386184.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338428,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T08:03:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382116,"name":"Fredrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fredrick is a resident of Mombasa, Kenya.

She has been working with 'Bancos de Emprendimiento' since 2006, in the group PIO XII. She is one of the most responsible members of her group. Adela lives in the area of the municipal district. In her family there are three members, her two school aged children and herself. More than a year ago she separated from her partner. She has a small restaurant out of her home where she cooks lunch and on Wednesday thru Sunday nights she makes 'silpanchos' [a traditional Bolivian dish that consists of rice, boiled potatoes, a thin schnitzel-style meat, chopped tomato, onion and parsley and topped with a fried egg]. Monday and Tuesday mornings she provides cleaning service to a business, and for the small amount of time makes a good income. Right now she wants the money to buy a refrigerator and other items for her business and to buy supplies at wholesale.  This is why she has asked for the loan and she is very happy and grateful to the institution for providing support when she needs it the most.

She achieved this through her free and independent spirit, generated by her own creativity.  She initially worked for an important city company.  To make more money, she made clothes for her coworkers with her mother's working tools, taking their measurements, and helping them to buy the right fabric as well as supplies.  In the year 1998, she decided to create her own company and resign from her job.  This is how it has gone, with her savings and the sales of her products she has managed to negotiate more customers from the ones referred by purchasers until this moment.  Today, she not only makes things from measurements, from contracts on credit for her best customers, but also has contracts with elementary and high schools.  She also has customers in the north of the city that recognize the quality with which she works the clothing garments and her delicate design.  She is currently applying for her first Kiva credit, and also her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to buy wholesale fabrics with it, because she has a contract with a high school to make uniforms.

Natalya has six built greenhouses plus two greenhouses for seedlings, and 150,000 hryvnia invested in the business.  She has been involved in agriculture for 15 years.  She spends up to 38,000 hryvnia on seeds and plastic every year.  Natalya needs a loan in the sum of 20,000 hryvnia to purchase a protective plastic for greenhouses for 7,000 hryvnia, seeds for 8,000 hryvnia and fertilizers for 5,000 hryvnia.  Obtaining these funds will provide Natalya with an ability to sow tomato seeds on-time.

He\u2019s a bricklayer\u2019s assistant, that is to say, he works building houses.  They had three children together who are 9, 8 and 6 years old.  All of them are attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth cycle Susana has taken a loan out in and she\u2019s satisfied with the results she\u2019s gotten.  On this occasion she\u2019s asking for the loan to invest half of it in the purchase of three sheep to raise and put out to pasture and the other half to buy yarn, needles, hooks, etc. to make tablecloths, vests, mats, sweaters and other knitted items.  This is the first time she\u2019s going to experiment with raising sheep at home.  She\u2019s attracted to this because she knows that if she takes care of them and causes them to fatten up she can sell them later on.  \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to invest your money in something so that when you need to sell your assets you recover your investment,\u201d says Susana.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the textiles, she has two years\u2019 experience.  This is her successful business because she says that she knows how to do it very well and what better thing to do than to put it into practice.  The way she makes these textiles is the following:  With a knitting needle.  \u201cLike any activity, knitting also requires much patience and dedication.  The \u201cganchillo\u201d is a method for knitting with yarn or thread using a hook and a ball of yarn.  One usually holds the hook in the right hand but even left handed people can learn to use the hook by just inverting the instructions.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo begin, make a slipknot.  \u201cPull on the thread of yarn in the center of the ball.  You pull a bow of about 12 to 15 centimeters from the end placing said end in front of the ball of yarn and then we let the rest of the end of the yarn to fall slightly behind the bow.  The hook is introduced through the bow.  The yarn is gathered behind the bow with the tip of the hook.  We pass it through the front of the bow.  Carefully we pull on the end of the yarn so that the bow is taught around the hook.  That\u2019s the first purl,\u201d says Susana.  She shared with us the way to knit because as she mentions to do so requires great patience.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she\u2019d like to continue to grow in her business because she knows how to do it and wants to continue putting it into practice.  \u201cI want to continue to help my children to go to school and to help my husband with expenses,\u201d says Susana.  With profits from her business she\u2019d like to do some home improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":985305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy sheep to raise and to buy embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382156,"name":"Ruth Meri","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Ruth Meri continua con su negocio de compra y venta de frutas ella sigue con el negocio porque le ha ido muy bien y sigue llevando a Puerto Maldonado, la socia trabaja arduamente para seguir creciendo economicamente; la socia solicita en esta ocasi\u00f3n el prestamo para invertir en la compra de fruta e incrementar su mercado.","en":"\r\nRuth Meri continues with her business buying and selling fruit.

Her mother passed down knowledge to her about how to cook and make good sales.  Natividad likes her work very much, because it allows her to have time for her family and have a good income so that she can contribute to the finances of the household.  She hopes to continue to work so that she can make progress and get ahead with her family.  She has a lot of plans, but at this moment she is working on expanding her business.  This will be her 16th loan with MFP, and so she awaits your support so that she can continue to pursue her goals.

Her group is located in the rural area surrounding El Seybo, an agricultural area. Before Esperanza came to her community, Delia started her business with a first loan that she took from someone in her community. A month later, Esperanza gave her a loan with which she expanded her business. This group is composed of 15 members running different businesses like shoes, clothing, cosmetics, and many other small businesses.\r\n\r\nDelia plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing jeans, blouses, t-shirts, shoes and cosmetics. She operates a miscellaneous sales business, selling products like these and many others, such as jewels, underwear, etc.  She has had her business for almost two years. She is excited to be taking out her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She will save her profits to reinvest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe makes her home here in a simple house with her long-time partner and their three children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to raise her children and to give them all they need. She is dreaming of having her own house and of having a successful business.\r\n\r\nTwo pictures were taken, one with 10 and another with five, to complete a whole picture with the 15 entrepreneurs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":985533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy jeans, blouses, t-shirts, shoes and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"El Seybo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.8 -69.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Odalis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zidor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osmona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Widna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanirda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Renaud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":13322.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":13118.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13363.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":13612.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":13866.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14125.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":14389.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":14657.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":14931.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15210.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15493.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":13908.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":346.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":347.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":367.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":374.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":688.24,"local_amount":26441.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":26497.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257164949,"comment":null},{"amount":1063.1,"local_amount":40842.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40929.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263296648,"comment":null},{"amount":742.22,"local_amount":28514.64,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":28575.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016002,"comment":null},{"amount":770.19,"local_amount":29589.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":29652.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276624972,"comment":null},{"amount":1161.25,"local_amount":44612.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":44708.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-20T19:04:51Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382244,"name":"Victor Hugo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl sr.

He always proved to be a hardworking, determined, and very dedicated man.  That's why his four grown children are all independent.  He lives with his wife in their own home, which he was able to buy thanks to a lot of hard work and sacrifice and which has always been the place where he shared happy moments with his children.  Now he is working hard to be able to offer his wife a better quality of life and to have a quiet retirement.  Segundo's work is repairing and maintaining air conditioners.  He generally works with a few public and private institutions, but when he's not working he's usually at home fixing things.  He's always waiting for his cell or home phone to ring because when it does it's because a customer needs him to go to his house or office to repair an air system.  He has been in this business for 31 years, during which he has gained experience and improved his technique.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have free time to spend at home and it also makes him good money because in his area the heat is intense and there are a lot of air conditioning systems, which mean a big market for him.  He is currently at the stage where he is expanding his business, as he wants to not only do repairs, but also to sell replacement parts for these products.  This will be his sixth loan with MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have the financial support to increase his working capital.  He also promises once again to make his payments on time, as he has with his previous loans.  He is very happy to belong to his communal bank as all the members are responsible and supportive.  With the 1,000 nuevos soles he has requested, he will buy materials and tools to better perform his job and he will also buy some of the parts he needs to start selling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":985556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy tools and parts\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":151.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":174.89},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.88,"local_amount":151.68,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":153.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246287,"comment":null},{"amount":56.99,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":153.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386296,"comment":null},{"amount":62.14,"local_amount":165.71,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099389,"comment":null},{"amount":64.46,"local_amount":171.89,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":173.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713536,"comment":null},{"amount":65.59,"local_amount":174.89,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":176.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202428,"comment":null},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":183.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":185.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098109,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T20:32:14Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":382256,"name":"Albalina Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Albalina, es habitante del municipio de Ticuantepe junto a su familia , los planes hacia su familia es poder terminar de construir su vivienda , esta muy feliz por el apoyo que le brinda Afodenic Atraves de los fondo Kiva ; ya que con el primer pr\u00e9stamo logro cerrar la pared de tablitas que tenia , ahora ella necesita financiamiento para poder embaldosar su casita ya que en la actualidad es de tierra y no cuenta con el dinero suficiente para poder realizar la comprar , debido a que ella labora como empleada domestica en una casa privada y su esposo es comerciante de pollo  y solo ajustan para cubrir apenas algunas necesidades del hogar .

He is married to 51-year-old Mar\u00eda and has five children, four of whom are grown up and live independently.  Only 15-year-old Carolina still lives with them.  The family live together in their own home and Arquimides works hard to provide them with a better quality of life.  Arquimides' business is farming.  He grows bananas, rice, cassava and other crops.  He owns his own farm where he works the soil and prepares it well so that he can obtain better fruit and produce at harvest time.  He has been in this business for 15 years and he still recalls that he suffered a lot when he first started his business because he needed to put in a lot of effort and hard work.  Eventually he was successful and he feels that it is much better to work for yourself than to work for other people as he did in the past.  When he works on his farm, Arquimides has the help of people that he hires and others who help him unconditionally, for which he is very grateful.  He is preparing to carry out new projects and gradually expand his farm.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Arquimides' 13th loan from MFP.

He is the father of three children: Robinson (15 years old), Rubi (8 years old) and Gisel (4 years old). He lives in his own home with his children and his wife Nelly, who is 25 years old. \r\n\r\nDarwin is a man that likes to be cautious and in his work it is important to always be calm and above all have good sense to do things. He makes a living transporting passengers and deliveries inside and outside the city. He has a moto taxi that he was able to buy due to hard work and much sacrifice. Before he was renting a moto taxi and was not left with much profit. He has been in this line of work for 15 years and in all of this time he has gained much experience and has learned that he needs to transport each customer with patience and above all safety. \r\n\r\nHe is doing well in what he does. He has many customers that hire him to transport them for hours at a time, which gives him more profits. Now he is preparing to be able to increase his business and buy another moto taxi to rent out and have an additional source of income. This is the 4th loan that he has taken out through MFP. It is his hope that with continued support he will be able to continue with his goals. He promises to make his payments on time as he has done with previous loans. With the amount of 1000 soles he will use the money to repair some parts on his moto taxi that as a result of the weather and the bad condition of roads have begun to deteriorate. \r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":985623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay a mechanic to fix parts on his moto taxi.

(Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.) This is her third loan with SPBD.\n\nLesina needs a loan of 2,000 WST to purchase freezer goods or meat such as mutton flaps, chicken, and sausages to sell. She plans to use the profits which are estimated to be 600 talas per week to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":985647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She is the mother a beautiful three-year-old little boy and she lives with her partner in the city of Chincha.  She works very hard day after day to make money for her little one and to give him what he needs.  In the little free time she has, she and her partner try to give her son a lot of attention.  Ana Cristina only studied up until the fifth grade because her parents didn't have enough money.  Like every good Peruvian, she likes the national cuisine a lot, but her favorite dish is the delicious carapulca.\r\n\r\nAna Cristina sells clothing for a living.  She works eight hours a day and sees about 20 customers.   Sometimes, when she doesn't have anyone to watch her little boy while she works, she takes him with her wherever she goes, since her partner supports her by working as a mototaxi driver.  She thinks her business is doing well because she has the best possible motivation, her son, because she would give her life for him and he's the reason she sacrifices so much to get ahead--so that he won't be lacking for anything.\r\n\r\nAna Cristina is very happy and thanks Kiva's lenders because it's thanks to their help that she will be able to buy much more merchandise (clothing).  This will improve her earnings and she will be able to keep saving to achieve her greatest dream, which is to offer her little boy a
