Ni Luh and her group members expect that a veterinarian will manage their pigs to help guarantee that they grow up healthy and provide the maximum income. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1456105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase four superior piglets to fatten","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":24000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T17:06:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":623097,"name":"Leuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leuma is a 57-year-old married woman with five children.

He left his area of Capinota for the tropics like the majority of people looking for better opportunities in their lives. In Capinota he grew corn, but his income diminished due to climate change. It was difficult to control and he saw his output continue to decline, so he decided to migrate to the tropics.  There he bought farmland on which today he grows yuca.

Adicionalmente alterna su trabajo de estilista con la venta de mercanc\u00eda y productos por cat\u00e1logo, con el fin de complementar los ingresos para ayudar a su esposo con la carga econ\u00f3mica del hogar y velar por el bienestar de su hijo de 10 a\u00f1os de edad. La prestataria es una mujer activa, emprendedora y perseverante, lo que le ha permitido lograr los objetivos que se propone, esto la motiva a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito con el que comprar\u00e1 herramientas de trabajo (plancha, secador de cabello, cepillos, tijeras, entre otros) y mercanc\u00eda al por mayor (perfumer\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios, entre otros), as\u00ed podr\u00e1 mejorar las condiciones de trabajo y prestar\u00e1 un mejor servicio a su clientela, adem\u00e1s tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s variedad de art\u00edculos para la venta con lo que obtendr\u00e1 mejor margen de ganancia, haciendo que sus ingresos familiares aumenten. De esta forma, Oralia desea continuar con su labor y trabajar con empe\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n, para que en un futuro pueda cumplir el sue\u00f1o de ampliar su sala de belleza e implementar nuevos servicios, dando como resultado una mejor calidad de vida para ella y su familia. ","en":"Oralia, 43, has operated her own salon business for 15 years.  She works seven days a week, cutting and combing hair and providing manicures and pedicures.  She operates her shop in a space on one side of her house.  Her sister helps her on weekends because she now has more customers than she can take care of by herself.  Oralia also sells beauty products.  She buys the products from a catalog and sells them to her customers.  Her income, along with her husband's, supports the family's needs and ensures that they can provide for their 10-year old son.  The borrower is a hard-working and enterprising woman, characteristics that have allowed her to meet her goals up to now.  She is now applying for a loan that she will use to buy the equipment she needs--hair dryer, brushes, scissors and other equipment--to carry on her business.  She will also buy wholesale supplies of beauty products--perfume, cosmetics and others--that she will resell.  The investment will improve Oralia's business and allow her to deliver a better service to her customers.  The wider range of products will provide her with a larger profit margin and, in turn, increase the income she has to support her family.  Oralia wants to expand her salon and provide new services, something that will ultimately lead to a better quality of life for her and her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":61.79,"image":{"id":1459645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy equipment and supplies for her salon business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Pueblo Rico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T15:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T15:00:12Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Oralia Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65503},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67313},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69174},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71086},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73051},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75071},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77146},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79278},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81470},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83722},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86036},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88414},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90858},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93370},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95951},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98603},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101329},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104130},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107009},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109967},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113007},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116130},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119341},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122639},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126030},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129513},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133094},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136773},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140553},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144439}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.65},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.53},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.58,"local_amount":51720,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52045.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074773,"comment":null},{"amount":34.21,"local_amount":64143,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":64546.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T18:30:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":623108,"name":"Taiaopo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taiaopo is a 21-year-old single woman with no children.

Her main challenges for developing her business include selling on credit and the growing insecurity in rural supply areas occupied by rebels and other undesirable armed groups.  \r\n\r\nIn

His father was a cattle breeder and Tulkindjon helped him since he was a child, and had his own ram that he had to take care of. As Tulkindjon himself says, \"At that time taking care of a ram was a childhood passion. Now, raising livestock is my means of making a living.\" He grew up and followed his father's footsteps. It wasn't easy at first, especially in the wintertime, when the earth was completely covered in snow and he had to put more resources toward feeding the animals. But through the years, experience proved itself and Tulkindjon started to find ways of solving problems for the best continuation of his business. Now he has four sheep and two cows, and his wife also helps him. Tulkindjon is also a craftsman - a bricklayer and plasterer. He makes extra money to cover housing, his children's education costs and everyday expenses. For seasonal reasons he can't sell his sheep right now and buy feed, since prices for them have fallen. Tulkindjon needs additional resources so that he can feed his animals and bring in new livestock. With this goal in mind he has turned to microfinance organization \"Arvand\" for a loan. He believes that the acquired loan will help to eliminate his difficulties. He conveys his thanks to Kiva for the assistance and its huge importance in his life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1455203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock feed and cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"\u0422\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0447\u043e\u043d ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1611.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1722.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.42},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T17:11:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626120,"name":"Mubeheza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ang\u00e8le fait partie du groupe  Mubeheza  et  habite \u00e0 Cibitoke.Elle est veuve.

She has children and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLeticia operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the Pandesal, a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. \r\n\r\nLeticia dreams to find a better stall for her bakery and hopes to become rich.

One of her sons goes with his father to help him in his daily tasks. Her husband owns a blacksmith shop in which he provides the services of welding. He also provides door-to-door services to his customers. Due to an increase in the iron\u2019s prices, he is unable to buy sufficient welding material, such as welding rods, soldering rods, etc. to carry on his business.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the demand of his customers and to run his enterprise, Haleema's husband needs some capital to buy welding material. Haleema requested a loan for her husband from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that he would be able to buy material to carry on his business. \r\n\r\nHaleema is very glad and thankful to

In addition, she intends to teach her granddaughter this same profession.  \r\n\r\nRosa plans to increase her tailoring business and hire more employees so that she can provide jobs to people in her community who are in need just as she was.  This will enable these people to support their families and provide a better future for their children, just as she intends to do with her granddaughter.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":73.96,"image":{"id":1459740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sewing machine and fabric.

Este negocio lo tiene desde hace 22 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 gracias a su madre, que siempre se dedic\u00f3 a la venta ambulante y fue as\u00ed como ella aprendi\u00f3.

She is married and her husband works in construction and farming. She only has a ninth grade education but in spite of that she has never given up in life. She has always worked in order to get ahead and her efforts have allowed her to set up a small business which is generating income for her family. \r\n\r\nAna is a very hard worker. Ever since she was very young she worked selling food like pastries, potatoes, enchiladas, and more. She has had her business for 22 years and learned it from her mother, who was always a street vendor, and that is how she learned. When she was about twelve, she was already going out to help her mother, selling door to door. After all of that, her mother became ill and has since passed away. This was a very hard blow for her, but in spite of it she has kept moving forward and decided to continue in the same business, but in a permanent spot. \r\n\r\nAnother way she makes money is by washing other people's clothing. That allows her to obtain extra income for her family. Her husband also helps her financially. Before she didn't have a business, only the experience her mother left her.\r\n\r\nThe money from this loan will be to stock her business. She will purchase at least 500 lbs of potatoes, 300 lbs of corn, rice, oil, cabagge, and other items in order to have more product available for sale, because it is easier for her to buy wholesale than to purchase each day she makes her sales. This will allow this client to have better income for her household.\r\n\r\nOne of her dreams is to expand her business a bit further in order to improve her children's situation, since one of her goals is to give them an education as best she can. She also believes that whatever little income she obtains will allow her to save up money in order to condition her home and live in something she owns."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.96,"image":{"id":1459759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy potatoes, corn, oil, and cabagge to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Sensuntepeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-28T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-27T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.58},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":47.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":47.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505352,"comment":null},{"amount":40.13,"local_amount":40.13,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716429,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-04T16:13:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625648,"name":"San Antonio De Jicamarca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cSAN ANTONIO DE JICAMARCA\u201d es un grupo puntual en sus cuotas.

","en":"Mukhbira is a 39-year-old teacher who lives in the town of Khujand. She is married with one son and one daughter. For ten years Mukhbira has worked in a high school teaching Russian. She likes teaching and has never changed jobs even though her salary is small. \r\n\r\nMukhbira's husband provides installation services.

She was born in 1976, is married and is raising three children. Her husband is a laborer and takes care of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nMehriniso decided to start a cattle business since she has helped her parents with their cattle since she was a child. She has been looking for help for a long time and finally heard about a course: \"Bring on Success,\" organized by the Association of Women's Issues. She took the course and got a lot out of it. She received a certificate upon completion of the course. Now she is ready to start her business, except that she lacks the money to buy cattle. She will be in business on her own.

When she was 15, her mother taught her to make crafts out of clay. In the beginning she was still in sixth grade in the village school. Later she transferred to study in the city, but economic circumstances only allowed her to complete the eighth grade. Since then, she has been working making crafts. She and her month-old son live with her mother, since the baby's father abandoned them. Josselin is determined to keep moving forward and give her son and her mother a prosperous future. \r\n\r\nJosselin has seven years of experience making clay dolls, but after taking a number of courses she has come to specialize in designing and painting the crafts, gaining access to the labor and commercial markets when she offers a better proposal for design and product presentation.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy paint, replace her worn-out paintbrushes, and pay labor costs for people who help her finish her products, since she can no longer keep up with the demand she has. She buys the paints and brushes in the capital city, since she can get a greater variety of colors and better prices there. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Josselin would like to increase her craft production and perhaps at least finish high school, since it will give her more opportunities in the future, whether to keep studying in the university or to have employment opportunities teaching clay crafts.

Here is her story:\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to choose which field to study at the American University of Central Asia, but I have to come to a firm and considered decision. It was quite an important decision for me because I will follow this major now and in the future. I feel that this  will significantly contribute to my future and plans. I strongly believe that upon graduating from AUCA, I will become a well-educated, responsible and professional specialist in the field of law.  \r\n\r\nKyrgyzstan is having many problems in many spheres. One of them is law. The Kyrgyz Republic needs more qualified and outstanding lawyers. I want to participate in political and social life in the future, try to help in developing and facing challenges in the future path of my country. The majority of lawyers usually become the heads of the countries. It is obvious that a random person never becomes a governor. For example, more than 60% of the presidents of the United States of America have been lawyers. \r\n\r\nThe principles of any democratic society are based on laws. To build a strong government, it is necessary to build a solid foundation. The foundation of the government is fair law. Law is one of the most important and difficult fields. \r\n\r\nI have always wanted to broaden the horizons of my worldview and my knowledge. I want to achieve goals in my life; these four years in AUCA will help me to realize my plans. I am an industrious and hardworking person and always try to be ahead of my schedule. Every time I have been able to  accomplish my objectives. \r\n\r\nI am happy to enroll AUCA because it gives a unique opportunity to all its students--everything except for a loan to cover their tuition fees. The loan is given by Kiva. I would like to apply for a loan, so that I will be able to cover my tuition fees.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1456433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

He is the father of four adult children: one son and three lovely daughters.  His two oldest daughters are already married.  His wife, Mukarram, is a caring mother and devoted spouse.  She used to work as a preschool teacher.  Nowadays she works with her husband, selling watermelons and cantaloupes at the market.\r\n\r\nRahmat grows fruits of the melon family, an activity he has been involved in for several years now.  When it is the season to sell melons, all members of the family participate, as a \"happy family\".

They have one son who lives with them even though he is 32 years old, who has had many difficult problems in his life. His only support has been his parents, and thanks to them this son has found a way to move forward; they are working in a business created by their son, but always with the support of his mother. Her husband works in the country where he cultivates the land and contributes to the family. \r\n\r\nCristina runs a barber shop in town where her son cuts hair. She has been the manager for two years and her son is the expert at cutting hair. He learned it thanks to a friend who taught him the trade and Cristina then decided to open this business without a clue, but she did it with the intention that her son would manage to overcome what had happened in his life. Knowing the job they decided to support him, and that is how today it is a well known barber shop in their area which they depend on for income. \r\n\r\nThe shop is 5 kilometers away from their home and they have to leave at 6 A.M. in their own vehicles to get to work. His mother is the one who oversees their expenses and necessities. \r\n\r\nThe loan being requested is to buy a suitable chair for cutting hair, and to change the mirror she will buy to a bigger one. She plans to invest in one more electric razor so she can have a spare one, or look for another employee to help with the business. With this she could be improving her family's income and can also improve customer service so she could have a bigger customer base. The conditions would be better and give a better image to the business.\r\n\r\nWith the business she plans to have not only her son working, but also to have two more employees so this shop knows how to offer a variety of cuts and good service. This as a good image could be profitable, and that is her dream: that in the future she can employ people, and that her son overcomes the problems he has experienced through love.  \r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":94.22,"image":{"id":1459929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a suitable chair for cutting hair, and to change the mirror she will buy to a bigger one.

De sus hijos tres unicamente, la menor vive con ella y estudia 5\u00ba  grado. \n\nDoris tiene 18 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la venta de ropa,  pero hace un a\u00f1o inicio en el negocio propio  de venta de verduras y frutas. Ambos negocios los conoce muy bien, ya que cuando su padre muri\u00f3, fue su madre quien le ense\u00f1o a como, poder trabajar en estos negocios; as\u00ed fue como aprendi\u00f3 las t\u00e9cnicas de comercializar los productos.

Ahora ya esta recuperada totalmente. Pero es necesario que empiece con el trabajo de nuevo, ya que en casa, los gastos no faltan y es importante que tenga ingresos para cubrir con dichos gastos. Con el otorgamiento del pr\u00e9stamo, se esta contribuyendo a que Doris, continu\u00e9 haciendo lo que mas le gusta, y a la vez tenga ingresos para su hogar.\n\nDoris tiene muchos sue\u00f1os, uno de ellos es poder dejarles donde vivir a sus hijos, para eso necesita remodelar su vivienda y construir el muro perimetral, para mas seguridad.

Her mother took her to work with her to help out. Her husband is a farmer. Of her three children, only the youngest lives with her and is in fifth grade.\r\n\r\nDoris has made a living by selling clothes for 18 years, but a year ago she began her own business selling fruit and vegetables. She knows both businesses very well, since when her father passed away her mother taught her how to work in these businesses; that was how she learnt product marketing skills. The places where she sells her products are five kilometres away. She goes on the bus. Every day she gets up at 4:30am to get breakfast for her husband and her daughter, and then she leaves to sell her products. She returns at 3:00pm. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase more clothing, since two months ago she was unwell and spent the savings from the business. She has now completely recovered, but it is necessary that she begins work again since there are still household expenses and it is important to have income to cover said expenses. Granting this loan means Doris can continue doing what she likes most while earning income for her household.\r\n\r\nDoris has many dreams. One of them is to be able to leave her children a place to live in. For this it is necessary to remodel her home and construct a wall around the perimeter for safety. She would also like to have a small store in her home and be able to buy a mill for her son so that he can work for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":74.77,"image":{"id":1459941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a widow with 2 children who are 35 and 33 years old, to whom she has dedicated many years of her life to helping them become responsible people who contribute to society. They are both independent and have their own homes. Loyda lives alone in her own home, and works as a contractor for field workers in projects that are a far way out of the city.\n\nShe contracts workers for various forest projects and on occasion for agricultural projects. Her job is to provide the quantity of labor required to ensure that the work is completed within the time frame and with the quality required and determined by the company or person who is hiring her services. Depending on the size of the job, the number of people employed can vary between 2 - 10 workers and so Loyda buys the necessary supplies according to the number of workers and the duration of the project. She has been in this line of work for more than 4 years and it is going very well. Loyda likes her work because she is well paid for her services and the work comes in short bursts. She likes being at the head of the group, directing the development of the projects taking shape in the field.\n\nWith her Kiva loan, Loyda is very happy with the financial support being offered since she will feel sure of advancing in her work.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 carnes fr\u00edas, para surtir su enfriador, pues tiene un volumen importante de pedidos, que planea responder, para con el producto de sus ventas, reinvertir y vender mucho mas, en el mes de Diciembre, temporada en la que usualmente las ventas ascienden.  ","en":"Marisol started her business selling cold-cuts two years ago taking advantage of her move to a neighborhood with many potential customers.  She was aware of the opportunity she had to help her husband support their home (consisting of him, and their three children with ages ranging between 8 and 16 years) and bought a refrigerator that she stocked with cold-cuts which is a very well-received product in that sector.  She started selling on credit very soon after and added cold beverages in larger amounts and at retail.  \n\nMarisol works hard Monday to Sunday in her sales tasks aimed at generating income to increase family well-being.  Her goal is to increase her clientele and to do so needs working capital to invest while she\u2019s collecting payments from her customers.\n\nThis is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy cold-cuts to stock her refrigerator because she has a significant number of pending orders she intends to fill.  She will use profits from her sales to reinvest and to sell much more, especially in December, which is a season when sales usually increase.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":38.41,"image":{"id":1457872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cold-cuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T13:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T13:10:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71911},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84598},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87136},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89750},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":92443},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95216},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":98073},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101015},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104045},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107167},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":110382},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":128264}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.41,"local_amount":71911,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72213.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732228,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T17:37:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":624331,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ronald de 22 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio en el centro de la ciudad, donde vende bolsos viajeros, como morrales, maletas, maletines etc. Cuando tenia 15 a\u00f1os, empez\u00f3 su experiencia comercial, pues su madre lo indujo a ella, con su apoyo incondicional, haci\u00e9ndolo vivenciar su propia experiencia comercial.

She is 49 and married and has four children. The climate where she lives is very good for agriculture and also for raising animals. Therefore 22 years ago she chose this business and is developing it to this day. She sells milk to her neighbours, who are very pleased with the natural dairy product they receive. She also sells cattle that she has taken care of for several months. She wants to develop her business but does not have enough capital to do so. She is requesting a loan of 8,000 somoni to purchase cattle, in order to develop the business. She plans to provide her children with a good education and modern technology with the revenue she receives. She awaits your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.99,"image":{"id":1458433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-10-29T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-28T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":220.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":242.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":249.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":278.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":267.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":294.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":297.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":294.68},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":314.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":323.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":328.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":343.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":341.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":367.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":380.8},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":382.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":394.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":408.5},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":420.59},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":431.72},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":444.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":458.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.86},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.81},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.54},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.99},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.8},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.86,"local_amount":220.51,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":223.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228696,"comment":null},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":250.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":253.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989646,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-26T23:54:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":623447,"name":"Mbodze","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mbodze is married with two school-going children.
