is Alicia, 58, a resident of Payatas, Quezon City, Philippines. She is the mother of children who are now working. She, together with her children, manage their own household while operating the business. She works hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Alicia earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in net sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan.

She is married to Normelito, and is the mother of three children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. A dream for most poor Filipino parents, like Melanie (she herself was a college undergraduate), is a college education for their children. It is believed that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nMelanie operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Melanie for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 540 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMelanie dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own car. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Eladio thanks in advance all the people that will help him with his loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1112118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers and weed-killers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-06-09T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-09T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eladio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.02},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.94,"local_amount":42.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":45.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423845,"comment":null},{"amount":17.32,"local_amount":43.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:21:33Z","rounded_local_amount":46.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294317269,"comment":null},{"amount":18.54,"local_amount":46.35,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-22T08:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":49.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301374087,"comment":null},{"amount":18.84,"local_amount":47.1,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-23T08:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308385324,"comment":null},{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":48.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-18T09:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368921,"comment":null},{"amount":20.44,"local_amount":51.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":55.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977958,"comment":null},{"amount":21.02,"local_amount":52.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-01T10:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331115135,"comment":null},{"amount":21.68,"local_amount":54.2,"processed_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-20T10:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":58.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506814,"comment":null},{"amount":22.46,"local_amount":56.15,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":60.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058765,"comment":null},{"amount":23.4,"local_amount":58.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":63.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355804311,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T21:33:36Z","paid_date":"2013-04-27T08:46:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435557,"name":"Peris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peris, 43, is married to her husband Jackson, who is a businessman.

Aurita earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy ready-to-wear products and merchandise items to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAurita hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and draw her family more closely to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Eight years ago, she opened her own business in the parish of Rio Verde in Santo Domingo, Ecuador.  Santo Domingo is the third largest city in terms of population, behind Guayaquil and Quito.  Within the last 15 years, this city has experienced an economic boom which has helped to drive development in the region.  Santo Domingo is located in a strategic area of Ecuador with mountains on one side and the coast on the other.  A highway links both areas by starting at sea level and stretches the entire length until it ends at about 2,600 meters above sea level.  Due to its central location, Santo Domingo is accustomed to being a point of convergence among the various cultures that live in Ecuador.  Sonia says that the neighborhood where she lives is very diverse and includes people with indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, Mestizo, and other ethnic roots.  Unfortunately, not everything has been good for the city in recent years.  Along with the rapid economic growth that Santo Domingo has experience, the city has also suffered from the effects of crime and narcotics trafficking.  \r\n<p>\r\nSonia is from this city.  She works in her sewing workshop between 8 to 10 hours each day and employs two other people.  This is the first loan she has requested and plans to use the money to buy fabrics.  She will use these materials to produce a variety of garments and accessories to wear.  Sonia considers the loan to be a help in expanding her production capacity, which will enable her to serve more customers and also hire another person.  Sonia really enjoys what she does and is also very good at it.  The skills she learned as a little girl have enabled her to work and support her family.  If Sonia secures the necessary funds, she will be able to fulfill her dream of improving the quality of life for her and her two children, as well as for the people who work for her.

This is her plan so that her children will have the greatest sense of well being possible, thereby increasing their likelihood of a successful future. Her greatest challenge is the daily transportation of her products, since it is not easy to find an available vehicle to borrow; consequently in the future she plans to have her own.

He lives with his two small children and his partner in the town of La Playa, very close to the sea. Since he was very young he has made a living selling fruit, motivated by his father and sister who make their living in the same way, selling not only fruits but also vegetables and tubers. He was their partner at first, but when he turned twenty he decided to sell lemons door-to-door with a little capital that he was given by his sister and a cousin. On seeing that this was going well, he rented a small stall in the public market where he also offered a variety of fruits such as papaya, blackberries, mango, ripe bananas, and naranjillos (little oranges), among other tropical fruits. He did well with this and acquired many clients, strengthening his business. However, since the year 2009 he has started to work in a private business in the business center, due to which he has had to move the business into his home.\r\n\r\nNowadays, he uses a wheelbarrow from which he sells produce around the neighborhood, where he is well known. He has different shifts at work each week and so his wife helps him when he can't go out to sell. He buys every three days in the public market but sometimes his clients request a greater variety of fruits, which for want of capital he can't provide.

When he harvests his fruit, his products are sold in different marketplaces around Lambayeque and Chiclayo.  He earns enough income to cover his household expenses.  He also earns money with his moto-taxi (a motorized vehicle for transporting supplies and people) and he offers transport services to people in the towns and city centers.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 3000 nuevos soles so that he can pay for maintenance on his moto-taxi.  He has used it for a long time and it is beginning to suffer and break down.  He also wants to buy compost and fertilizer for his crops.\r\n\r\nHe already had a loan through Kiva, it went well, and he is very grateful to the people that gave him the opportunity.

Santo Domingo is a city that is strategically located in central Ecuador between the coast and the mountains.  It has become a central point for transit and commerce.  This city currently has about 600,000 inhabitants.  It also has the unique distinction of having changed provinces.  Santo Domingo was previously part of Pichincha Province, but then became part of the newly formed province of Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas.  The province takes its name from an ancient ethnic group that occupied this area.  This indigenous group known as the Tsachila had a custom of dying their hair red using the pigment from the achiote tree.  Santo Domingo has an average temperature of 25\u00b0C.  What is very interesting is that Santo Domingo is an hour away from the beach on one side and is two hours away from the Andes mountains on the other side.  \r\n<p>\r\nEly maintains his home where he lives with his wife Marianita.  They have three children (ages 13, 11, and 5).  Ely is a traveling milk vendor and has been in business for approximately three years.  His dream is to improve the conditions of his home to make it more beautiful and more secure.  He believes that the home is the key to developing the values of his children.  For this reason, Ely is requesting a loan to acquire more collection tanks and milk so that he can expand the routes that he covers for delivering his product.  This will enable him to sell in greater volume and improve his earnings.  The income that Ely currently earns is not enough to sustain his entire family, especially since he is the only breadwinner in his household.  He is confident that he can meet this challenge before him and fulfill his dream.  Ely is a good man who is very dedicated to his work, but he needs a little help in order to continue growing.

In 1995, he established his jeans, shirts, boots, shoes and shorts business. Working seven days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Malikie has already received and successfully repaid three loans, and now he requires a new loan in order to buy additional jeans, shirts, boots, shoes and shorts. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 350,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Malikie plans to open another shop for his brother who has come from the village. He thanks you for your support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1102055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to pay for shoes, jeans, shirts and boots.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T14:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T14:00:11Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Malikie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435657,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 47-year-old married man and a father of four children.

is a wonderful, enterprising woman of 28. She is the driving force behind her family. She lives with her husband and four children at Mwambalazi, Kenya. Her business is operating a food stall, selling fried food such as chapati (flat bread), cooked beans, cooked rice, etc.  Through her hard work she has built up a strong demand for her products, and she has gradually been expanding and making a better income to reinvest in the items necessary to strengthen the business. Today she lives at her own family business; her husband and children are also involved. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is her second loan with Yehu Microfinance Trust, an organization through which she has acquired loans to boost her business and thus make a better income to continue improving her family's well-being. With this Kiva loan she will purchase basic materials and ingredients, such as corn, flour, oil, sugar and salt. Her greatest challenge is that her working capital does not turn over sufficiently to cover the growing demand. With her Kiva loan she will be able to purchase at discounted rates, in cash, and in a greater volume. With these permanent injections of capital, she will work in order to later achieve her greatest wish: to have an adequate restaurant in a good location.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1113563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to

When they reach the ideal size and weight, she offers them in the various markets, since she has her own customers in the city of Chiclayo.  In addition, she has a small store that she has set up in one of the rooms of her home.  The idea of this business arose out of the demand that existed in the area for staple goods and groceries.  The income that she expects from these activities will allow her to obtain greater income to cover her daily needs.\r\n\r\nYtamar requests a loan from Edpyme Alternativa of 2,000 nuevos soles to purchase groceries and staple goods to expand her store, as well as feed for her animals.

At his young age he does several activities for a living. One of them, the one he is requesting a Kiva loan for, is the sale of clothes for ladies and gentlemen, footwear, make up and accessories in general, both in cash and on credit, among family members, friends and neighbors of the area. With the loan he hopes to get working capital that will allow him to buy a higher volume of merchandise for sale, since one of his challenges has been not being able to get some of the orders made by his customers due to the lack of it. He sells both in cash and on credit among family members, friends and neighbors of the area. He is not afraid to make this investment, since by satisfying current demand and diversifying his products, he would get a higher profitability, fact that gives him a lot of confidence. He began working in the commerce business 3 years ago, to have a source of income while he was studying Computer Mechanics at an official educational institution. Thanks to this, nowadays he is able to offer his services at a private company as a mechanic, which is also an income source for him. When he is not at the store his family helps him, especially his sister, with the sales and with helping the customers. For the development of his business he uses some equipment such as: display cabinets, mannequins, showcases. Still, one of his dreams is to expand his store and turn it into a big department store that can generate employment and bigger profits that will allow him to continue studying and become a professional. He considers himself to be a very active young man and very willing to progress."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1113877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase merchandise such as clothes, footwear, make up and other miscellaneous items to support his customers' demands ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140123},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":149615},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":153106},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156678},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":160334},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164075},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167904},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":171821},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175831},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":179933},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":184132},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":196448}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.04},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435886,"name":"Soperiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soperiana is married with one child.

is a farmer in her rural hometown of Kisii. She is married with two children, ages 13 and five. She has been farming for 20 years and runs the farm with the help of one farmhand. She produces mainly maize, beans, vegetables and milk for the local market. She runs a retail shop selling farm produce like cereals and vegetables which she sources from her farm as well as from other local farmers. Hellen has requested a loan of 52,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow. She says this will boost her milk output for her family's consumption and income through sale.

Around 10 years ago, her partner was left without a job and so they decided to look for an alternative source of income.  Initially, with the severance pay they received, they went to the municipality of Maicao in the department of Guajira, which is a border area that many merchants pass through, to buy foodstuffs and non-perishable food products at good prices.  They planned to resell these later at retail prices, mainly to neighborhood shopkeepers, friends, and acquaintances.  Little by little they got more customers who would ask them for all kinds of different items besides food, such as clothing, shoes, and home appliances, among other things.  They gave these customers payment periods of up to 45 days, which is still the sales policy they use.  Clara knows her customers very well and she tries to meet their demands according to the season.  This is why she is asking for her first loan to take advantage of the approaching Fathers Day celebrations by stocking colognes, shirts, wallets, and jeans, among other clothing items and men's accessories, which she mainly sells on credit.  Hers is a family business that is organized in such a way that each of them takes care of a segment of their customers to make sure they give very good customer service.

He acquired his experience in agriculture many years ago when he used to raise livestock.  Later, he went to work in a rice company where he was involved in the process from the planting until the point at which the product is ready to be sold.  With all of this experience, he started cultivating his own parcel of land.  He started cultivating half a manzana (a little less than an acre) of land.  He worked very hard, and it required a lot of sacrifice, but it was worth it, because now he has 2 manzanas of land.  He also sells staple grains to help cover the household expenses.  He doesn't sell his products outside the community where he lives because the transportation and selling costs are very high.  So he sells only in the same region where he lives.  He is requesting a loan from Kiva to cultivate another manzana of rice.  This will help him to farm on more land, and thus increase his income.  In the future, he plans to buy an irrigation motor and make some improvements to his house. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1113902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to cultivate rice on an additional plot of land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-10T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-10T19:00:10Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":405.27,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":202.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":202.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.51,"local_amount":202.64,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":212.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005953,"comment":null},{"amount":212.49,"local_amount":202.63,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":212.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373165746,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T06:02:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:36:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435847,"name":"Maria Antonieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta se dedica a la venta de mercader\u00eda en general, actividad que la inicio como  iniciativa propia para sufragar gastos, el negocio lo vende de forma ambulante  Ahora solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para la compra de pantalones, camisas, ropa de ni\u00f1os, sabanas , ropa interior  entre otros.","en":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta has a business selling general merchandise.

Every day Maria works in her business selling chocotejas, tejas and washing clothes. She works in her business around 5 hours per day and she can service up to 10 customers each day. During her city's holidays she works some more time making chocotejas and tejas, which is a typical confectionery, and tourists always buy a lot. She believes she does well at her job because she has good cooking skills for making sweets and also because she is responsible and careful when she does laundry, which is why customers always recommend her. Maria is very thankful to Kiva lenders since thanks to the help provided she will be able to buy a new washing machine, which will allow her to provide a better service and also do more laundry. She will also be able to buy supplies to make tejas and chocotejas such as milk, chocolate butter and pecans, among others. So she will continue fighting to make her biggest dream come true: \"Build her house out of noble materials\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1113929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a

Edgar dice que cuando saca la cosecha la vende en el mismo sector para evitar gasto de transporte y porque es m\u00e1s seguro vender su producto en la misma comunidad.Cuenta con otros ingresos ya que trabaja algunas veces como alba\u00f1il aunque tambi\u00e9n vende la leche que producen sus vacas.\n\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar parte de los insumos para la huerta y  comprar alambre para reparar las cercas, Edgar dice que este cr\u00e9dito le ser\u00e1 de ayuda pues no tendr\u00e1 que vender unos cerdos de engorde que tiene porque quiere engordarlos aun mas para despu\u00e9s venderlos a un mejor precio y tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1 hacerle las reparaciones a las cercas para evitar el paso de las vacas a la huerta. Sus planes futuros son una vez  que saque la cosecha cancelar el cr\u00e9dito y de las ganancias de la venta de los cerdos comprar unas vaquillas para obtener mejores ingresos. \n","en":"53-year-old age Edgar is a native of Teustepe, a merchant, he makes a living of one of the most common activities of the city of Teustepe as it is the sowing of corn, bean and wheat.\r\n\r\nStart his farming operation 30 years ago due to the fact that his grandmother died leaving the land as an inheritance to his mom, currently Edgar is who is responsible for the land and maintenance of the pasture, but not only he is responsible for the care of the land is also planting corn, bean and wheat, milks his cows and grows hi pigs.\r\n\r\nEdgar said that he sells his crops in the same sector in order to avoid transportation costs and because it is safer. He has other forms of income since it works sometimes as a bricklayer and also sells the milk his cows produce.\r\n\r\nHe requests the loan to buy some inputs for the garden and to buy wire to repair the fences. Edgar says that this loan will be helpful since he will not have to sell a few pigs that it has because he wants to fatten them more to later sell them at a better price. He will be also able to do the repairs to the fences, which will avoid the cows to step in to the garden.\r\n\r\nHis future plans are, once he sells the crop, to cancel the loan and with profits from the sale of pigs buy some heifers for better income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1114162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy some inputs for the garden and to buy wire to repair the fences.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-06-11T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-11T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Antonio   \t ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":617.66,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":308.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":308.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":308.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332005954,"comment":null},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":308.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971584,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-30T15:07:29Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:17:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":435967,"name":"Rina Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rina, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo, con la intenci\u00f3n de invertir m\u00e1s en el negocio comprando se mayor variedad de ropa nueva e invertir\u00e1 en blusas casuales, ropa de caballero, y ropa interior, con esta mercader\u00eda espera poder tener mayor aceptaci\u00f3n con su clientela.\nEl efecto que tuvo con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue positivo pues le ayud\u00f3 a mantener el negocio de las ventas y ha podido generar ganancia para ayudar a su familia, el n\u00facleo familiar se mantiene, y cuenta con mucho entusiasmo para seguir trabajando de la misma manera.\n","en":"Rina, has decided on a new loan, with the intention of investing more in the business buying a greater variety of new clothes, blouses, casual clothing for men, and underwear.

Heng obtained the first loan from VisionFund in 2010 and he is now leading a loan group to apply for another loan after his first loan was repaid. This previous loan has enabled him to feed his family, providing them with enough food. Heng's group consists of four members and they are all new to VisionFund except him. As the leader, Heng will use his portion to buy fertilizers and seeds for his plantation. Also, he will use a portion of his share of the loan to pay for labor fee.

As villagers of Dambae district, her family has been farming rice and growing cassava to support their daily living for six years. One of the main constraints for her family is not having sufficient food to eat. Ann's group consists of two members. Ann has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles while the other group member has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles. After their previous loans ended, they applied for another loan.
