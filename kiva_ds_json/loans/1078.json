The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit she has received, Khatuna will rent a space to open a food court where they make Turkish Donners, and will purchase a special mounting for it. She wants to employ her son Tsotne, and they will both set up the family business. Tukish Donner is very popular in Tbilisi and Khatuna will rent a place in the crowded area, where she hopes her business will be profitable. All of the family members will then be employed, and their income will significantly grow. The profit will give them opportunity to have better living conditions.

She lives in Gardabani District with her retired mother in-law and two sons (Elnur and Gasan). The only source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Goncha\u2019s mother-in law-and her small salary from the shop where she is working as a seller.\r\n\r\nGoncha has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGoncha has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Goncha will purchase calves for a good price.

The group is composed of 8 members and is directed by a board, of which Ms. Betty is the President. The members' businesses are varied and include: cell phone sales, food sales, vegetable sales, phone card sales, buying and selling livestock, and transportation. The loan will have important benefits for the group of small business owners of which Betty is a member. She says that she has already had two loan cycles with Pro Mujer, becoming involved at the invitation of a recruiter from the institution who visited her at home. Betty has a business selling food. She has had the business for three years, beginning it on her own initiative.

The community is adjacent to the boundaries of Michoac\u00e1n State in Mexico. It is not very easy to access the community, because there is almost no transportation to the town and one has to walk to catch the microbus that passes by. Don Tomas is part of a group called Las Palomas ('The Doves'). He says it is the first time he has joined a lending group. He is asking for this loan because he has a small grocery and supply store in his community, and would like to stock the store using this money. Every week he goes to the town of Zitacuaro to buy vegetables and other items to sell so his store is well-stocked and customers in his community do not have to waste their time traveling to get what they need. Don Tomas says he will use the loan money to buy tomatoes, chile peppers, onions, potatoes, eggs, beans, rice, chocolate, sugar, salt, matches, light bulbs, cooking oil, soups, soft drinks, plantains, toilet paper, tuna, sardines, chiles in vinegar, and other necessities. The credit will help him improve his business, which is the only well-stocked store in the community. His dream is to make his shop a little bigger so that the products fit better. The other members of his lending group are called Virginia, Susana, Angelina, Maria Regina, Fernanda, Carmen, Celia, Bulmaro, Esperanza, and Marcia. They will invest their portions of the loan money in items for their businesses, such as buying a horse for working plots of land, purchasing sheep and food for the sheep, buying a cow for milking, and buying men's and women's clothing, sweets, and other items for

Janchiv, 48 years old, lives with his wife and daughter in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on fenced land. He has been running an automobile repair shop for seven consecutive years. In wintertime, the number of customers decreases drastically, so he produces and sells cookers to local people. The automobile repair shop he owns has been heated by a low pressure heater and the authority of Darkhan city requested he install a central heating system for energy efficiency. So, Mr. Janchiv is requesting a loan of 6,000,000 tugriks to install a central heating system in his automobile repair shop.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the installment of a heating system is that it offers a more environmentally-friendly solution than a direct electric heating device. This stems from the fact that most electricity originates remotely using fossil fuels, with up to two-thirds of the energy in the fuel lost at the power station and in transmission losses. Typical efficiencies for central heating are: 85-97% for gas-fired heating; 80-89% for oil-fired, and 45-60% for coal-fired heating. Based on these facts, installment of a heating system in the automobile repair shop will enable Mr. Janchiv to spend less on energy

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater Jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the Jeepneys are one of the things that truly makes the Philippines the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In addition, she also plants potatoes every year and grows grains on a 5.31 hectare plot of land.

For the past four years, Rose has been working hard to manage her clothes store, where she sells clothes.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to improve on the business and buy new cloths to sell, and will help Rose to generate greater profits, expand the business and look after the family. Rose hopes that in the future she will be able to start another business.\r\n\r\nRose is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

She is applying for a YOUTH LOAN from Kiva's partner Al Majmoua in order to buy a car that will help her improve and expand her business, by providing education to students who can't come to her house that live in nearby villages.\r\nHamidi is planning to open a special teaching center where she can attract more students and expand her working area.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":830,"image":{"id":1313435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","use":"to buy a car that will allow her to travel to students that need her tutoring services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamidi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T09:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355736027,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364441418,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372846647,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614876,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390472378,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T08:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399728472,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409997403,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419762011,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429412099,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T09:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439630091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T17:49:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538409,"name":"Edith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edith is 32 years old and lives in Sinkor, Montserrado County.

p\u00fablica. No tuvo posibilidad de pagar sus estudios universitarios, por lo que decidi\u00f3 autosustentarse instalando una tienda en el barrio donde vive con surtido suficiente para ganar varios clientes de la zona. Kerly vive en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nKerly ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para poder comprar una waflera y licuadora que le ayudar\u00e1n a ofrecer otros productos en su negocio para aquellas personas que no les qued\u00f3 tiempo para desayunar en casa y puedan pasar por el negocio de Kerly sirvi\u00e9ndose un jugo o un delicioso sanduche preparado en waflera. En muchas instituciones financieras se cerraron las puertas para obtener un cr\u00e9dito y poder financiar este crecimiento de su negocio, sin embargo, Kerly no se ha dado por vencida y en busca de mejorar su estilo de vida e incluso en un futuro retomar sus estudios, ha encontrado una instituci\u00f3n que gracias a la intervenci\u00f3n de Kiva puede apoyarle en sus sue\u00f1os sin poner muchas trabas y haciendo part\u00edcipes a varias personas alrededor del mundo. Para Kerly es muy importante que su negocio crezca para que su vida mejore y tambi\u00e9n pueda aprovechar el esp\u00edritu emprendedor muy caracter\u00edstico de los habitantes de Santo Domingo. ","en":"Kerly is a young woman, hardly 18 years old, who has just finished her secondary education in public school. Paying for university studies wasn\u2019t possible, so she decided to support herself by setting up a store in the neighborhood where she lives. She has enough merchandise to win over some customers in the area. \r\n\r\nKerly lives in the R\u00edo Verde parish in Santo Domingo, which is the capital city of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. This province in Ecuador has had a high level of sustained growth in recent years. The capital city\u2019s most attractive features are its delicious fruits and its local cuisine. It also has a considerable amount of trade since it has become an inland port for trade between the mountainous and coastal regions of the country. In addition, it has many tourist attractions that, coupled with its warm climate, are very busy with both national and international tourists. Because of this, most of the inhabitants have set up commercial businesses or services for inhabitants and tourists. \r\n\r\nKerly has requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to be able to purchase a waffle iron and a blender that would allow her to offer more products in her business. People that don\u2019t have time to eat breakfast at home can come by Kerly\u2019s business to have juice or a delicious sandwich prepared with the waffle iron. A lot of financial institutions have closed their doors to the possibility of giving her a loan to finance the growing of her business. Nevertheless, Kerly has not given up. Looking to improve her quality of life, including in the future taking up her studies again, she has found the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. Thanks to Kiva, the foundation involves many people around the world and supports her dreams without putting many obstacles in the way. For Kerly it is very important that her business grow so that her life can improve and so she can take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit that characterizes the people of Santo Domingo. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1313657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase a waffle iron and a blender to offer new kinds of food in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kerly Mishell","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":413.44,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":68.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.35},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.91,"local_amount":63.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":64.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524926,"comment":null},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":67.51,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":69.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133231,"comment":null},{"amount":70.53,"local_amount":68.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":70.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313770,"comment":null},{"amount":72.06,"local_amount":70.1,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":72.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565375,"comment":null},{"amount":73.35,"local_amount":71.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":73.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814415,"comment":null},{"amount":74.76,"local_amount":72.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":74.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T18:36:31Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538432,"name":"Ivane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ivane is 50 years old.

It totals 350 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nShmagi requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Shmagi will install gas equipment in his own car and will serve local people as a taxi driver.

Lasha requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has a milk cow and a vineyard. They are milking the cow to make cheese. From the harvested grapes, they are making vodka, and they sell it all locally at the markets to get a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nLasha requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lasha wants to build a greenhouse.

He lives in the town of Pisco with his wife and their two small children, whom he loves very dearly, and who are his main reason for living. He is very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic. Together with his wife, they do everything in their power to make ends meet. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Alfredo was unable to study business management, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to listen to music, and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken dish called 'seco de pollo', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Alfredo works in his own tiny shop that sells cleaning products. He also sells drinks at his house.

Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Willian was unable to study information technology, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to play football with his friends, and sometimes cooks a delicious chicken-and-rice dish called 'arroz con pollo', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Willian works as a labourer on a farm in his town. He also has a small business of his own: he raises and sells rabbits. He works every day for about twelve hours and attributes his success to his efforts and his amiability towards other people. Willian is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since, thanks to their help, he will be able to build an adequate enclosure for his rabbits. To this end, he will buy cane, wooden sticks, and wire mesh. He hopes this will help him raise and sell more rabbits and keep working towards his great dream of learning a profession and improving his lot in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1313809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build an enclosure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-17T20:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-16T20:20:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willian Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.61},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.6},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.09},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":76.08,"processed_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":77.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483374,"comment":null},{"amount":31.09,"local_amount":79.15,"processed_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":80.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889409,"comment":null},{"amount":32.06,"local_amount":81.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664309,"comment":null},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":85.65,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":87.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775651,"comment":null},{"amount":34.81,"local_amount":88.6,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779043,"comment":null},{"amount":113.5,"local_amount":288.91,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":294.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T20:44:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:16:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538479,"name":"Patricial","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricial, a 25 year old lady, lives in West Point, one of the most populated and well known market areas in Montserrado county.

With the received credit, Tengiz will purchase a metal protective grid used for smoking fish. The demand for smoked fish is high in the villages, so Tengiz hopes his business will be profitable.

He lives in the town of Nazca with his wife and their two children, whom he loves very dearly, and who are his main reason for living. He is very nice, hard-working, and enthusiastic. Together with his wife, they do everything in their power to make ends meet. Unfortunately, due to his economic situation and the need to start working at a very young age, Pedro was unable to learn a profession, which is what he would have liked to do. In his spare time, he likes to listen to music, and sometimes cooks a delicious lamb dish called 'seco de cordero', which he shares with his family. On his own initiative, sparing no efforts, and with admirable dedication, Pedro works as a taxi driver in his town.

Today she has a good farm with a dairy cow, sheep and goats.  With the income she has earned from raising livestock, Nasira has created good conditions in which to raise her animals, and she built an extension to her house.  Her monthly income from her business is 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of livestock and farming activities.  She raises her livestock and sells them at the local market.  With the goal of increasing her business further, Nasira has turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase fuel and fertilizer for her spring field work.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family owns an agricultural plot of land where they grow maize, nuts, plums, tomatoes, and apples. The harvested fruits and vegetables are sold locally at the markets, providing a small income for living. \r\n\r\nTinatin requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program has a provision for business start-up and re-startup with credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Tinatin will purchase a milk cow. She will milk the cow to make dairy and milk products which will be sold locally at the markets and significantly grow the family income. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Tinatin wants to reinvest profit in the same business to purchase more cows and develop her farming.

y esforzado. Pudo estudiar hasta terminar la escuela secundaria y est\u00e1 separado de su esposa con quien tuvo 3 hijos que a ra\u00edz de la separaci\u00f3n dejaron de vivir con \u00e9l, pero Jhony no los ha descuidado ni un solo d\u00eda, dos de ellos tienen 8 a\u00f1os y el tercero tiene casi 3 a\u00f1os. Este hombre trabajador ahora vive solo en el Cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo de la provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds. \nJhony desde que sali\u00f3 del colegio trabaj\u00f3 como empleado en el sector de la agricultura y en la crianza de cerdos, de estas experiencias aprendi\u00f3 la actividad a la cual se dedica desde hace 10 a\u00f1os en su terreno. Todas las ma\u00f1anas se dedica a la limpieza de las chancheras y la alimentaci\u00f3n de los cerdos y las tardes visita a sus hijos o va a la feria de animales a ofertar sus chanchos y adem\u00e1s a recolectar el alimento para sus animales. A pesar de que la separaci\u00f3n de su c\u00f3nyuge le afect\u00f3 y frustr\u00f3 mucho, Jhony sigui\u00f3 trabajo con el sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda ver a sus 3 hijos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia como el no pudo llegar a ser. Es su primer cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con la confianza, asesor\u00eda y eficiente gesti\u00f3n que le brindaron, principalmente porque han contado con el producto Kiva. Con este cr\u00e9dito, realizar\u00e1 la ampliaci\u00f3n de los criaderos para una mejor crianza de los cerdos y tambi\u00e9n para poder traer m\u00e1s cerdo y as\u00ed incrementar sus ventas.  Jhony agradece a quienes aportan la financiaci\u00f3n de este crecimiento laboral que adem\u00e1s aportar\u00e1 para que pueda empezar la construcci\u00f3n de su casa propia. ","en":"Jhony is a 30-year-old man. He grew up in a home with limited resources where the value of honest and hard work was always instilled in him. He was able to study until the end of his secondary education, and he is separated from his wife with whom he had three children. Since the separation, the children no longer live with him, but Jhony has not neglected them for a single day. Two of them are 8 years old and the third is barely 3 years old.\r\n\r\nThis hardworking man now lives by himself in the canton Santo Domingo of the province Santo Domingo in Tsachilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountainous region with the coastal region of Ecuador, and is a city that has become a commercial center with several growing sectors. It contains various enterprising families that started small businesses some years ago and now are microbusiness owners that support a generation of employment. Studies show that most of the businesses began empirically and have grown with the passage of tourists, businesspeople and travelers that move from one region to another and in addition it is the third most populated city in the country.\r\n\r\nJhony since leaving school worked as a laborer in the agricultural sector raising pigs. From these experiences he learned the activity which he has devoted himself to for 10 years on his land. Every morning he bathes and feeds the pigs and in the afternoons he visits his children or goes to the animal market to sell his pigs and in addition to pick up feed for his animals.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the separation from his wife which affected him and frustrated him greatly, Jhony continued working with the dream of one day seeing his three children becoming professionals of excellence, as he failed to become one.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from Fundacion Alternativa and he is very happy with the trust, consulting and efficient management that they offer him, principally because they could depend on Kiva loans. With this loan, he will expand the nursery to improve the growth of the pigs and also to be able to bring more pigs and thereby grow his sales. Jhony is grateful to those who support the financing of his job growth that will also help him to begin construction of his own house.

He is a sheep breeder and has 20 head of sheep in his herd. He has 16 years of experience in this field. His brother helps him in his business. Bayramali also has a garden, where he raises seasonal fruits and vegetables.  His wife is a housekeeper, and she looks after the house and helps her husband to look after the sheep. \r\n\r\nThe village where Bayramali lives is located in the southern part of Azerbaijan, with very rigorous climate conditions. In summer, the temperature reaches 105 degrees, Fahrenheit, and the main problem in the region is water for irrigation and for animals.  Bayramali is not able to build a water channel for his garden and animals, by himself.

He worked his way up from associate to assistant manager, and then to a manager\u2019s position. While working at the state prison, Jose decided to open his own jewelry store, but after 15 years, health issues forced him to close. When he got better, he embarked on a new entrepreneurial venture: a tobacco shop.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the state for 18 years. I\u2019ve already worked for someone else all my life.  I want to work for myself,\u201d Jose says. His main goal is to expand his business and retire. \r\n\r\nHis new business, Blue Frog, is a tobacco smoke shop, which sells a variety of tobacco products, pipes and incense.  \r\n\r\nBlue Frog is open seven days a week and closes late at 10 p.m. The shop carries all types of tobacco products, incense, and pipes. \r\n\r\nOriginally from Edinburg, Texas, Jose followed his dream and moved to nearby McAllen, where he says rent is more affordable. He says he found a shop close to downtown and is paying half of what he would have elsewhere. Though the shop has only been open for a month now, Jose says a competitor has already offered to buy him out. He says, \u201cFrom what I heard from customers, my store is a lot cleaner. It\u2019s the way we have it set up compared to the other stores that makes it different.\u201d\r\n\r\nA returning client of Accion Texas Inc, Jose remembered the microlender when looking for a loan, which he is using to purchase inventory. \u201cI invested $8,000 to connect the light and water and I bought merchandise myself, but I needed more inventory. When I knew I needed a little more, I went to Accion,\u201d he says. Without the loan, \u201cI would have been stuck for a while. The merchandise that the customers were asking for, we didn\u2019t have. Without the loan, I would still be waiting on the merchandise.\u201d \r\n\r\nJose runs his business while still holding down his job at the prison.  And he has one employee to help. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about this business,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in retail before and now that I found someone to sell wholesale to me, I can succeed.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1561.02,"image":{"id":1313655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

is 61 years old. She lives in Teliani village, Kaspi district with her daughter, son in-law and his retired mother. The family is persecuted and they live in a special village for refugees.  Zempira requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only income for the family is from small farming. Zempira owns a small plot of agricultural land where she grows potatoes and tomatoes. They also have chickens and sell eggs and harvested vegetable to the villagers. \r\n\r\nZempira requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Zempira wants to purchase grocery stock to open a shop. She has a small commercial space where she will open a grocery shop. Since Zempira will not have to pay the rent and her expenses will be minimum, she hopes to get a good income from this business.

I figured that it was good, the business is already built, and the clientele is already there,\u201d he says.  \u201cI called some of my partners who went to work at different companies and offered them to team up; they all agreed. The whole idea was to keep the solid team.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor Carlos, the move was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d He says the hardest work was rebranding the company name in 2009, but even that wasn\u2019t too complicated. \r\n\r\nInnova Digital Systems, located in Carlos\u2019 hometown of El Paso, Texas, is an information technology outsourcing company that works with other companies and nonprofits on providing telecommunications installation, computer repairs, network assistance, and cabling, wireless, theft and maintenance services, as well as security, firewalls, email hosting, and web design. \r\n\r\n\u201cAnything that you can think of for your business, we do it,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cWe basically become a client\u2019s IT department. Or if the client has an IT department, we act as their consultants. We have more than 75 years of combined experience.\u201d In addition to his experience in information technology, Carlos has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from the University of North Texas.\r\n\r\nThe seven-member team consists of three partners and four engineers, who constantly work out of the office, in the field. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a tech geek,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cThat goes back to my college days. I was going for computer information systems, which allowed me to get a business administration background. All in all, it was a good move and opened a lot of possibilities.\u201d Since taking ownership of the company, and re-opening the business three years ago, Carlos moved it to a different location and gained more clients. \r\n\r\nConsidering his operating expenses, purchasing and payroll costs, and money needed for projects while waiting for payments from clients, Carlos decided to seek financing. Remembering his uncle\u2019s mention of Accion Texas Inc. years ago, Carlos attended one of Accion\u2019s seminars and met a loan officer. He says after that meeting, he felt comfortable returning to the office to apply for a loan, which he says, \u201ckeeps us on track to reach our sales goals and increase profits.\u201d \r\n\r\nWithout Accion\u2019s help, Carlos says, \u201cWe would have had to pay real high interest rates on credit cards to fill those expenses. Our margins would have been cut and we wouldn\u2019t have as much business as we do now.\u201d  He says he plans to hire more engineers soon. \u201cOur plans are to grow as much as possible,\u201d Carlos says, adding that he plans to expand slowly and carefully.  \r\n\r\nHe\u2019ll hire only one additional engineer in 2013.  He is also looking to hire someone to manage advertising and social media promotion.\r\nTo learn more about his business, check out his website at www.idselpaso.com.

in the city of Ica, in the district of Parcona. He is a very kind, hardworking, and enthusiastic individual who possessed of a great desire to get ahead in life. Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources and to the need to work from a young age, he never had the opportunity to receive an education in agriculture. In his free time he likes to see movies and on occasion he cooks a delicious Chicharron de Chancho to share with his family. On his own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Luis started working in agriculture. He has a small plot where he plants corn. He works every day for about 12 hours and believes that he is doing well thanks to his experience and to the friendly service he provides to others.\r\n\r\nLuis finds himself very grateful for the Kiva loans, seeings thanks to the help provided he will be able to purchase compost, fertilizer, and other products. This way he will be able to ensure that what he sows will grow well and he will be able to bring in a good harvest. If he continues working and putting forth tremendous effort to get ahead, his big dream is to increase his plantings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1313883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase compost, fertilizer, and other items.

She lives in the city of Konibodom. She was married, but unfortunately her husband passed away several years ago. Zebo has two children. She faces great hardship as she bears all the responsibility for her children and herself, but she does not get discouraged, and she works tirelessly. Zebo has a higher education, but does not work in her area of expertise since she cannot support her children on one salary. She works in sales of dried fruit, a business she has been in for the past 15 years. She buys goods in another city. This is her sole source of income. Her children help her when they are not in school. On the advice of friends, Zebo decided to apply for a loan, and turned to Arvand. She plans to use the loan to buy dried fruit from a different city and sell it at a higher price. She very much hopes that this loan will help her expand her business and adequately support her children.

","en":"Sadridin is 27 years old, married, and has two children.  After graduating from secondary school, he could not continue his education because he needed to help his family.  He has a large family made up of 6 people.  Sadridin is the oldest son.  His father is a Jack of all trades, does not have a formal job, and spends much time at the employment office.  It is difficult for Sadridin, as he not only needs to help his brothers and sisters get on their feet, but also his parents.  A few years ago, he found work as a baker.  He likes this job and and would very much like to continue on in the profession.  One year ago, Sadridin opened his own, small bakery out of his home from which he receives a good return from selling his cakes.  Now he has plans to open an actual store from which to sell his baked goods since space is a bit tight at home.  He needs funds to do this.  Sadridin has turned to Arvand for a loan.  He will use the funds to buy all the necessary products (i .e. sacks of flour, butter) for baking.

Ayoash hopes to make more profits and open a cafeteria.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.5,"image":{"id":1314451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy potatoes and a chip fryer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-03-18T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-17T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayoash ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zahra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":16096.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364442735,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372847945,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381616179,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391369922,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-19T08:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400175965,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419763490,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T10:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429413551,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8048.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439631534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T12:29:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538834,"name":"Salma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salma's business is running well.
