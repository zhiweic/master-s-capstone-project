In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, where groceries, toiletries, and beverages are sold piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5-PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jaznalyn earns money by getting her supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Jaznalyn's store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Jaznalyn earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nJaznalyn is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Jaznalyn hopes to be able to expand soon.

Saidaskar has a bachelor of science degree in physics from Khudjan State University which he received in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 he worked in the high school #6, but a teacher's salary was insufficient to support his large family. As a result Saidaskar was forced to quit his teacher position and go to Russia for work. After returning back to Tajikistan he has started his own farm, where he primarily grows wheat, potatoes and other staple crops as well as raises farm animals. Saidaskar has more then ten years of farming experience and his wife and older children help with the work load. The harvest is usually sold whole sale from home to resellers. Saidaskar wants to take out this loan to purchase fertilizer and some more cattle for his herd.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1117490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

He is married and has adult children. Mavliddin always had a hard life. As a child he raised sheep and goats. Every day after school he would also work in the fields to help his parents support their family. After Mavliddin grew up and married he continued to farm and raise animals for a living. For the last 20 years he has primarily grown wheat, corn, peas and other staple crops. His wife and sons help with the work load and the family sells their harvest to the local residents below market price. Most people in the region purchase their own wheat and then have it ground at the mills and bake their own bread. This year Mavliddin wants to get higher profits so that he can pay for the wedding of his youngest son. Mavliddin want to take out a loan to purchase cattle which he will fatten and sell for meat at the market. He will use leftover profits to expand his business and improve the farm.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1117511,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-06-22T17:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-22T17:00:20Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavliddin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308190213,"comment":null},{"amount":262.67,"local_amount":1250.82,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331162340,"comment":null},{"amount":262.52,"local_amount":1250.08,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801297,"comment":null},{"amount":262.31,"local_amount":1249.1,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381692685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-22T13:31:42Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:59:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":440086,"name":"Nelva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelva es socia del Bancomunal Milenio y tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y madre de dos hijas.

He lives in the city and has been managing a cotton processing factory for the last ten years. Bahtiyor also raises cattle for sale. His wife is a home maker and takes care of their cows while Bahtiyor is at work. In the past cattle raising was their primary source of income but now the children grew up and much more money is required for their education. To keep up with his family's needs Bahtiyor rented a cotton processing plant and works there himself. He is taking out this loan to finance repairs to the equipment at the factory. Bahtiyor is very grateful to Kiva for their assistance, since Kiva's loan program for people with low and middle income really help them to improve their lives.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1117476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to repair his cotton processing plant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She has two daughters and lives in Ivano-Frankivsk.  For the past seven years, she has been involved in wholesale and retail business and sells fruits and vegetables at the central food market.  Since she has no permanent place to conduct her business, she sells her goods from her own booth.  She sells produce at prices that are attractive to both wholesale buyers and the average consumer.  Her net income is about 3,000 hryvnia.\r\n\r\nOlga plans to invest an amount of 12,000 hryvnia into the purchase of a wide range of agricultural products such as cabbage, cucumbers and tomatoes. She hopes to increase her working capital and take advantage of lower purchase prices. \r\n\r\nShe has recently bought a minivan for 14,000 dollars, which has significantly eased her work and helped her to become more mobile.  Over time, she would like to complete some repairs in the apartment where she lives with her parents and her children.\r\n\r\nNote: The description is in

She is married and has three adult children. Mehriniso has always had a hard life. Since her childhood she raised cattle and worked in the fields. After she married she continued farming to feed and support her husband's family. She primarily grows wheat and oats and has been successful for the last 30 years in this business. Her husband and sons help at the farm. The family sells their harvest to the local residents below market prices.

Andres started out helping his dad with raising his livestock while his mom lived off the income she made renting out their land.  His parents gave Andres some of their land as an inheritance.  Having gained experience and skill in the business, he decided to start working for himself.  He started sowing crops on his own.  He has two 'manzanas' (one manzana = 1.68 acres) of land sown with rice.  He has the support of his cousins, children and wife in his business.  They help him to prepare his land.  He has been in this business for three years now.  He sells his crops in the local area to avoid having to pay for transportation and because it is safer to sell the produce in his own community.  He also receives additional income from selling milk from his cows.  This enables him to help with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAndres is taking out this loan to prepare his land and to buy fertilizers, supplies and pesticides.  He believes that this will be helpful because he will be able to enjoy a better production which will allow him to increase his income.

One of the members of this group is Lorenza Patricia, 48, better known as Do\u00f1a Paty.  Paty makes and sells bread and other Mexican dishes.  Normally she sells her food in a kindergarten located in her community, where she has been selling for 30 years.\r\n\r\nPaty is a single mother.  She comments that, thanks to the good profits she gets from her business, she managed to give her five children a good education.  All of them are already married.  She mentions that one of the characteristics for doing the work she does is to be very hygienic, to have  good seasoning, and above all to be an active person.\r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her business making and selling bread is the aroma of the bread when it comes out of the oven.  Besides, it is her biggest seller.  On the other hand, Paty's biggest challenge is when she has to kill the chicken to make the shredded chicken for her tostadas, because she doesn't like to hurt animals.\r\n\r\nPaty says that one of her most beautiful experiences in her business is that she has learned to be an independent woman, because she likes to work with her money and her profits.  She also says that she believes she is special because, although she has had needs as a single mother, she always has the strength to achieve what she sets out to do.\r\n\r\nPaty requested her loan to buy flour, eggs, lard, yeast, Royal brand baking powder, butter, and milk to make bread.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Elva, Cecilia, Martina, and Susana, who all sell Mexican snacks; Elsa, who sells food; Rosalina Alberta, who sells beverages; and Silvia, who sells bread.

Since 1996 Shirinkan has been selling groceries and she started her business with a small sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Due to her hard work and perseverance the grocery store is now worth 70,000 som (KGS) and profits from the business have helped Shirinkan to purchase a used car. Her husband now uses the car as a taxi cab which brings additional profits to the family.

Zaporozhskaya region of south-eastern Ukraine. Elena rents a store space where she sells groceries: fish, sausages, pasta, pastries, drinks, ice cream etc. She really likes her job. In her store all the groceries are carefully arranged and it is always clean and cozy. Other grocery stores in the city are located far away from Elena's store so there is not shortage of customers. Her groceries are in demand and there are many regular clients. Elena has had her grocery store for 3 years already.\r\n\r\nElena is planning to invest 10000 griven from the Kiva loan to replenish her inventory and purchase more sausage varieties, more kinds of pastries etc. She is a very goal oriented person and her business has been profitable but this spring the store suffered two robberies and Elena lost a lot of money.

Bayaraa, 35, is an electrician in the power plant in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. His salary is not so high and it does not usually meet his family's needs. He lives with his wife and his two children in their old house. His wife is a pharmacist, but she still has not been employed and she runs a taxi business to increase the family's income. \r\n\r\nHis house was built in the early 1990s and since then it has never been renovated or had any repairs. Due to this, it is becoming difficult and uncomfortable to live in their old, bad house. Especially in winter, his house becomes very cold due to the heat loss through the windows and walls. So he decided to make necessary repairs to his house. To start with, he is planning to put in wall and window insulation. He hopes it will be very helpful to reduce the smoky coal usage and the related excessive fuel cost. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 \u00baC (-40 \u00baF), even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.

He knew the business very well since his family had much experience in it.  She suggested they start the business at home.  They did not have any money for the machinery but a neighbor of hers who had owned a bakery and still had the equipment offered to rent it to them with an option to buy.  She accepted and they still use it to date.\r\n\r\nShe buys what she needs for production daily and her portfolio rotates every two days, the time in which she collects payment for what she sells.  She\u2019s asking for her first Kiva loan because she wants to reinvest in supplies and raw materials like flour, margarine, yeast, spices and eggs for production.  With this she will be able to have stock on hand to meet growing demand.  In addition, she wants to buy a display case to sell directly to the public since she currently makes the product and immediately distributes it to neighborhood stores, her main clientele.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is being able to own her own baking equipment and not have to rent it from her neighbor any longer so that her profits will be greater and her profitability will be higher than her current 28%.\r\n\r\nGina lives with her husband and three minor children, the products of her union.

Since she was very young, she had to help in her home because what her mother earned from her work as a maid, wasn\u2019t enough to cover the household expenses.  Through a friend she began to sell products by order that were bought through specialized catalogs.  Nowadays Sandra buys the products directly and sells them to customers in the La Sierrita neighborhood where she lives-to friends and referred customers.  With her first Kiva loan she bought a large quantity of products to fill the existing orders.  These products are items such as perfumes, lingerie, clothing, and small electrical appliances.  With it she hopes that her sales will increase for a profit of more than 40%, the level that she currently manages.  Her customers buy mostly on credit and pay her under 30 days.  Her main problem is  keeping her business in the area where she lives because there are security issues that force her to be very careful and strict with her customers.

She is requesting a loan again so that she can continue to buy more handcrafted items made from wood such as vases, tables, lamps, rocking chairs, sectional benches, and a variety of other items.  Gloria is a restless youth with a strong desire to excel and build her business into a large company.  Ever since she was granted her first loan, Gloria has been enrolled in accounting and finance classes in a public institution that offers professional programs; she has completed 5 modules there.  This makes her very happy, and she works every day to make her dream a reality.  She wants to organize her business inside her house, giving it more space so that it can be seen by passers-by.  Her message for all the Kiva lenders is the following: \"Thanks to all of you, I am striving toward my goals, and maintaining a firm intention to continue ahead so that I can achieve each and every one of my goals.  Thank you so much for your support.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1120510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Ochirkhuu is 43 years old and lives with his family in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. He is an electrician in a private company, where he has been working since 2007.  Before that Mr. Ochirkhuu used to run a taxi business. \r\n\r\nMr. Ochirkhuu's monthly salary does not usually cover his family's necessities. So he wants to restart his old business - the taxi business - again. He will run it beyond his work in the nighttime. So, he now needs money to cover the cost of purchasing a car. It will be a car with a natural gas engine which is natural-oriented and less harmful to the environment. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  As well, the smoky and extremely toxic smoke from the cars is one of main reasons for Mongolia's hard air pollution.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan he is taking will used to cover the cost of buying a car which uses natural gas.

Enkhtaivan, 55, is a pensioner who lives with her husband and her son in a ger district, an area of the city with no running water, minimal roads, and spotty electricity. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a watchman in a company, and he doesn't earn that much. Enkhtaivan\u2019s retirement benefit is about $125 per month, and both of their incomes do not cover their family\u2019s expenses. Her son works in a supermarket. \r\n\r\nRecently, her husband decided to start a taxi business to increase their family's income. So, Enkhtaivan is taking out a loan to support her husband and the start-up of his new business. As he said, he will run a taxi after his day job (during the night), and that will be very helpful in solving his family's financial issues. \r\n\r\nThe main thing is that he is choosing a car that runs on natural gas. He and Enkhtaivan totally believe it will help to reduce the air pollution from cars. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in the summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is another reason for Mongolia's air pollution. \r\n\r\nIn response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems, and also to buy cars that use natural gas.  We believe that together we can decrease the pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. \r\n\r\nThe loan Mrs. Enkhtaivan is taking out will be used to cover the cost of buying a car that uses natural gas.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1971.83,"image":{"id":1123306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

41, is a watchman for a company in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia. His salary is not so high; usually it does not cover his family's necessities. He lives with his wife and his 2 children in their old house. His wife used to work as a herder; now she is employed as a janitress.  \r\n\r\nThe house was built 23 years ago, and it has never been renovated or repaired.   It is more and more difficult and uncomfortable for Sukhtulga and his family to live in their old, rundown house. Especially in winter, the house becomes very cold because of heat loss through windows and walls. So Sukhtulga decided to make necessary repairs. First he plans to fix the walls and repair the roof.   He hopes those repairs will be very helpful in reducing his use of coal, which is very smoky to burn and also costs too much. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density of any country in the world, it is one of the most polluted. This is due to the long and cold winters, when temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F), even in the cities.  Even in summer, many parts of the country are very cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both houses and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night as families just try to stay warm.  \r\n\r\nIn response, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans for home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems.  Credit Mongol believes that together we can decrease pollution and the harm it does the environment and Mongolians' health. Sukhtulga's loan will be dedicated to buying building materials to repair his home and insulate its walls and thus reduce heat loss and harmful emissions.

Para ello cuenta con la colaboraci\u00f3n de 3 empleados que se encargan de llevar el producto a sus clientes ya que su mercado es amplio. Sin embargo, su sue\u00f1o es tener m\u00e1s vendedores para abarcar nuevas zonas donde pueda vender m\u00e1s productos.  Este es su primer credikiva con el que desea comprar escobas, traperos y medicamentos por volumen para as\u00ed obtener costos m\u00e1s bajos y al venderlos lograr aumentar sus ganancias.  Uno de sus mayores desaf\u00edos ha sido la recuperaci\u00f3n de la cartera, esta rota cada 8 d\u00edas pero algunas veces lo que recupera no es suficiente para realizar las compras y responder a los pedidos de sus clientes.  Wilson se considera un hombre trabajador, con muchas ganas de salir adelante y de brindarles un futuro mejor a sus hijos, d\u00e1ndoles estudio y haciendo de ellos unas personas de bien.","en":"Wilson, a parent, is 38 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Los Cedros de Soledad. \r\n\r\nHe works marketing cleaning products and hardware, and distributes generic medications from store to store in different neighborhoods of the city. He works with 3 employees who are responsible for delivering the product to the customers since the market is large. However, his dream is to have more sellers in order to extend over new areas where he can sell more products. \r\n\r\nThis is his first Kiva loan with which he wants to buy brooms, mops and medications in volume in order to obtain lower prices and to sell them successfully increasing his earnings. One of his biggest challenges has been the recovery of his capital, this turns over every 8 days but sometimes what he gets it back is not sufficient to make the purchases and respond to the orders from his customers. Wilson is considered a hard worker, eager to get ahead and provide a better future for his children, giving them an education and bringing them up to be good people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":1120551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy brooms, mops, and medications by volume to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-23T02:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-23T02:20:08Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson Armel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":214851},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":224531},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":229770},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":235132},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":240618},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":246232},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":251978},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":257857},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":263874},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":270031},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":276332},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":288794}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":121.75,"local_amount":214851,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":217078.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338915,"comment":null},{"amount":127.23,"local_amount":224531,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":226858.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395467,"comment":null},{"amount":130.21,"local_amount":229770,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":232151.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775255,"comment":null},{"amount":133.24,"local_amount":235132,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":237569.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387253,"comment":null},{"amount":136.35,"local_amount":240618,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":243112.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994088,"comment":null},{"amount":139.53,"local_amount":246232,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":248784.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130449,"comment":null},{"amount":142.79,"local_amount":251978,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":254590.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519321,"comment":null},{"amount":456.22,"local_amount":805087,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":813433.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071160,"comment":null},{"amount":312.68,"local_amount":551801,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":557521.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497381,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

It is made up of four women: Najat, Lamis, Nathal, and Hanan, who are neighbors from Taiz, Yemen. They are hardworking women. They are taking out a loan of 180,000 YER. Najat is the group leader (she is the woman who wears glasses). She is 48 years old and married. She is a very efficient woman, because she likes to work and thus, help her family. She has two children who are all studying. She hopes that all her children will be able to finish their studies. Her business sells incenses and perfumes, and this has been her sole source of income for more than four years. She started her business when her husband's salary was insufficient to cover their family's expenses.

This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health.

In order to expand the herd, Rabiya has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) which she will use to buy calves.

cradles.  Despite the fact that the job is tiring and requires a lot of patience, Khudoikul has a lot of optimism.  His trade provides him with moral satisfaction.  Every time he builds a new cradle he takes into account the quality, longevity, and beauty of the design and of course its ease of use.  Since his fantasy knows no bounds he would like to take out a loan in order to translate his ideas into reality.  These resources will go toward creating new wood masterpieces that are so necessary for the home and for childcare.

Madina mainly grows wheat, potatoes and other staple crops. She uses a portion of her harvest for the needs of her own family and also prepares fodder for the livestock from crop leftovers. The rest of her harvest Madina sells to the local people at below market prices. Due to insufficient personal funds and bad living conditions Madina wants to take out a loan to purchase cattle and fertilizer for her farm.

She has been running her business since last year and earns only a modest income. \r\n\r\nErdenechimeg lives with her husband and her two children in their recently-built house on a small plot of land. Her new house is built of cement bricks and loses a lot of heat, so she has decided to insulate the walls with red bricks, which are a very good insulation material. She hopes that her house will be warm after the repairs. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40 C (-40 F), even in the cities.  Also, in summer, many parts of the country are still extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss and improve heating systems. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan Erdenechimeg is taking will be dedicated to buying building materials to insulate her house.

She currently lives with her husband and son in the sector of Villaflora, which is south of the Ecuadorian capital of Quito.  The city of Quito is situated in the Andean mountain range at 2,800 meters above sea level, making it the third highest world capital.  In 1978, Quito was named the first World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its landscape that combines nature and infrastructure in a unique way that it becomes classified in a category of its own.  Quito is divided into three parts:  the Historical Center where colonial Quito is preserved; the North where the higher socioeconomic classes traditionally live; and the South which is known as the \"poor side\" of the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nMercy sells groceries and provisions in bulk.  Among the main products she offers are rice, sugar, oil, unrefined cane sugar, and brandy.  She works seven to eight hours each day.  Her husband works different hours of the day as a driver, but his income is not sufficient.  For this reason, Mercy's business is important to her husband and their 16-year-old son.  In order for her family to have a more decent life, she is requesting a Kiva loan.  The extra money will be used to buy and transport brandy and unrefined cane sugar so that she can increase the sales of her business.  With more income, Mercy dreams of improving her quality of life and building a house of her own.

Yesenia has a store where she sells a variety of merchandise, women's products, housewares and school supplies.  She also makes the most of her premises to offer a telephone service which she previously ran from her parents' home.  Yesenia has gradually gained a very good customer base.  She manages to sell not only retail, among her neighbors, but also stocks the stores around her.  Her sales have gradually increased and, as a result, her purchasing needs, in bulk and for cash, have also increased.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the loan to buy men's and women's shoes and men's, women's and children's sweaters, as these are the goods which have the best turnover and she is preparing for the holiday season when her volume of sales will increase.  Yesenia's aims for growth and prosperity are never-ending because she would like to give the best of herself for the sake of her two children so that they can enjoy a promising future.

started working as a merchant. He started his business with the hope of earning income to take care of his family. He sells dried apricots and processes apricots from an orchard for later sale. He runs the business by himself, although his wife helps him process the apricots. Each year he buys apricot trees and rents  1.5\u20131.8 hectares of orchard space from the cities of Kairakkum and Kandbadam. Shukhrat also sells dried apricots; he buys them at the market in Kanibadam and sells them in Isfar. Shukhrat is married and has one son. He has received loans through IMON International for several years, and has a good reputation and an excellent credit history. This provides him with some additional income. Shukhrat would like to obtain a loan in the amount of 3000 dollars to acquire an orchard's worth of apricot trees to grow and process apricots."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1122053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
