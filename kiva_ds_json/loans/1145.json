She married at age 18, gave birth to her four children at home, and was widowed at age 30. While her husband was alive, she tended to the household chores; however, after he died, she worked outside her home, washing and ironing, so that she could raise her children. \r\n\r\nBeing both mother and father and experiencing the bad luck of having her house destroyed by rains, she decided to apply for a loan. She used the loan to buy clothing to resell as a street vendor, work she has done now for 18 years. She continued renting with her children and slowly saving to build a new house, where she decided to set up a store and sell basic household items. She also sold coconut preserve as she traveled around selling clothing. Her store stayed open for four years, largely for the friendliness she showed her customers, but it never made a profit, and she had to close it. \r\n\r\nShe has applied to Fundacion Campo for a loan to pay for surgery on one of her eyes; otherwise, she may lose her sight. Her other eye is also affected and in danger, though her vision in that eye is a bit better. The loan will meet her need for eye surgery to repair her sight and avoid going blind. If the operation goes well, she will see normally and be able to keep working as long as God allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1370473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","use":"to pay for surgery on one of her eyes; otherwise, she may lose her sight.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2015-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.86},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.51,"local_amount":65.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":65.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381938838,"comment":null},{"amount":74.66,"local_amount":74.66,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":74.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801830,"comment":null},{"amount":80.75,"local_amount":80.75,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":80.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814913,"comment":null},{"amount":879.08,"local_amount":879.08,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":879.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090748,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T09:13:07Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:18:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571803,"name":"Lucila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucila is 43 years old, married, and has five adult children.

In his free time, he likes to watch movies, and he occasionally prepares a delicious pork rind and fish dish to share with his family. \r\n\r\nWith dedication and on his own initiative, Ivan provides taxi service in his city. He owns the car he uses for work. Ivan works about 10 hours every day and feels that business is good because he knows where to find the most passengers.\r\n\r\nIvan thanks the Kiva lenders, whose support will allow him to do general maintenance and to buy shock absorbers for his taxi. Ivan's taxi will be in better shape, and he will be able to continue offering service, working, and striving to achieve his great dream of owning other cars to rent.

is 30 years old. He lives in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, with his wife and child. Irakli requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nIrakli has a small commercial space in a very populous area, where he has opened a grocery shop. His wife is working in a beauty salon for a small daily income. \r\n\r\nIrakli requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

When asked, 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Mary replied, 'I will purchase a dairy cow to boost milk production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net, TV' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient and keeping costs down.\"\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":288.23,"image":{"id":1370792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2981.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3060.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3141.1},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3224.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3309.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3397.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3486.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3578.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3673.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3770.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3870.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3972.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4077.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4185.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4295.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4409.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4526.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4645.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.02,"local_amount":3213.11,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3247.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960582,"comment":null},{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":3298.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820258,"comment":null},{"amount":40.06,"local_amount":3385.22,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3421.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417336,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":7041.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7116.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880876,"comment":null},{"amount":43.32,"local_amount":3660.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3699.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529498,"comment":null},{"amount":44.47,"local_amount":3757.59,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3797.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753421,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T02:28:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571769,"name":"Six Star Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Six Star and consists of four ladies who live in Taiz, Yemen.

Beka lives in Tskhramukha village, Khashuri district with his wife, retired mother-in-law and two children (1 and 5 years old). Beka requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milk cow, which is milked every day to produce cheese. Also they own a plot of land, where haricot and maize are grown. Beka is a very hardworking man and he is trying his best to ensure a proper life for his family. He harvests the products and sells them together with dairy products at the local markets. Their additional income is Beka\u2019s mother-in-law's monthly pension. Also Beka recently opened a metal and plastic doors and windows workshop and earns a small income from it. \r\n\r\nBeka requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Beka has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Beka will purchase raw materials for his newly opened workshop. After having more materials to work on, Beka will be able to get more private orders. He will work hard and long hours to satisfy client needs and try to expand his business. For this he will reinvest part of the profit.  Another part of the profit will used for purchasing all the needed household goods for his family to provide better living conditions for them. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":979.6,"image":{"id":1370803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To purchase raw materials for his newly opened metal and plastic doors and windows workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tskhramukha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-16T23:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-16T23:10:02Z","loan_amount":3800,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beka ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":3800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":173.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":175.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":191.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":194.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":199.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":202.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":206.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":211.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":215.12},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":228.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.35},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.46},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.47},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.03},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":152.23,"local_amount":152.23,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":152.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613744,"comment":null},{"amount":157.93,"local_amount":157.93,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":157.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857456,"comment":null},{"amount":161.2,"local_amount":161.2,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":161.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134106,"comment":null},{"amount":166.76,"local_amount":166.76,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":166.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107693,"comment":null},{"amount":168,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255231,"comment":null},{"amount":173.48,"local_amount":173.48,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":173.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019367,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-19T03:18:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571811,"name":"Celia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celia is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a buying and selling charcoal business in the Philippines.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from trading clothes. They buy clothes at the wholesale price to resell them at a mark-up among the villagers and earn a small profit.\r\n \r\nApina requested a loan from Credo to start-up the family business. Apina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people who do not have access to credit. These poor, rural people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Apina will purchase stock of clothes for her trading business. She wants to expand the varieties of the products she has to offer a better choice of products to her clients. As Apina will have a bigger stock she will significantly decrease the expanses and increase the profits. The family will use part of the profits for reinvesting and purchasing more clothes and part to improve their living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":605.9,"image":{"id":1370877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase stock of clothes for her trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gardabani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T02:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T02:40:01Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":103.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":108.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":110.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":112.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":123.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":129.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":132.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.53,"local_amount":90.53,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613746,"comment":null},{"amount":97.9,"local_amount":97.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":97.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857458,"comment":null},{"amount":100.22,"local_amount":100.22,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134108,"comment":null},{"amount":103.69,"local_amount":103.69,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":103.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107695,"comment":null},{"amount":105.07,"local_amount":105.07,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":105.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255233,"comment":null},{"amount":108.49,"local_amount":108.49,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":108.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-09T18:33:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571841,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary is 50 years old and married with five children, two of whom are in school.

Mary is very grateful for the loan because she already has her piglets.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty that Mary is facing is that she does not have the money to purchase large quantities of food for her little pigs because she says, \"If the food were cheaper, I would have the same pigs that I had before.\" Mary came to have 60 piglets just for fattening, but the price of the food has gone up by a lot, and she believes she won't be able to care for all of them. The piglets that she bought will grow and get fat in just four months, and after this time, she thinks she will sell them in her fast food stalls as meat tacos. Mary has three taco stands in the town.

He works from early in the morning until late in the evening. There are times when he drives late until the wee hours of the morning in order to make a better profit. His regular customers are his neighbors and members of the local community. The family has a total of four tricycle units. The three tricycles are being used by other tricycle drivers, who then pay their daily quota. Arnold earns a minimum of PHP 1,200 per day from his transportation business. To help him continue operating the business, he is applying for an loan of PHP 8,000. He will use the loan to buy motorcycle parts for the maintenance of his four tricycle units. He has to maintain his units in good condition in order to have a regular income to cover the daily needs of his family. Arnold dreams of having more tricycles.

She is married and has three children.  She was not able to get into a university after completing school due to financial difficulties.  But Firuza has had a love for sewing since childhood.  She liked very much to observe how her grandmother sewed national dresses.  And when Firuza grew up, her grandmother gave her her sewing machine.  Gradually, Firuza learned how to sew national dresses.  Now she is a professional seamstress.  She has a lot of clients.  This is how Firuza earns her living now.  Firuza's sewing machine has gotten old and often breaks down.  This is why she wants to buy a new sewing machine, but she does not have enough money to buy one.  Hence, Firuza decided to come to the Arvand organization for a loan.  She hopes very much that Arvand will help her and offer financial support.\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":409.45,"image":{"id":1371821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":" to buy a new sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firuza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":59.88},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":64.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":67.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.25,"local_amount":54.25,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":54.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752045,"comment":null},{"amount":55.61,"local_amount":55.61,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":55.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616141,"comment":null},{"amount":57,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860011,"comment":null},{"amount":58.42,"local_amount":58.42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136755,"comment":null},{"amount":59.88,"local_amount":59.88,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":59.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900950,"comment":null},{"amount":61.38,"local_amount":61.38,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":61.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550131,"comment":null},{"amount":62.91,"local_amount":62.91,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":62.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774353,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T19:43:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571961,"name":"Maa Mangala Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bishnupriya is a 39-year-old lady.

They average 47 years of age and three children each. They live in the village of Nerekoro, in the region of Segou (4th administrative region of Mali) and know each other as neighbors and through ties of marriage and kinship. They work in small trade, selling rice (gambiaka, 2nd grade), green onions, etc.\r\n\r\nTo bolster their working capital, the group members turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, and this is their 7th group loan cycle. Mrs. Awa (first on the right in the photo) enjoys a great reputation as a seller of a wide variety of rice. She will use her loan to buy 500 kg of rice. She conducts her sales from her home, for cash and on credit, to a clientele composed of both men and women. \r\n\r\nMrs. Awa expects to earn an average monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA, which she will use to invest in her activity and to cover her children\u2019s tuition fees. Like the other group members, she hopes that their partnership with Soro Yiriwaso will help to bolster her activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1371863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nerekoro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata    Bata             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata                           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badialla                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678664,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924278,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207467,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972133,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972134,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-17T19:34:03Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571976,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is 32 years old, married, and he supports a family of seven people. \r\n\r\nHe runs a furniture-making business in Kapsabet town, in Nandi County.

Being a farmer this has affected her crop production, which is her main source of income. Sarah uses charcoal and firewood for cooking and kerosene for lighting because there is no electricity connection in her home. Every month she spends approximately $35 without counting the time and energy used to collect firewood. She and her two daughters are also at risk of sexual harassment from forest guards when they go to collect wood. \n\nTo save her from all these challenges, the Visionary Empowerment Programme team encouraged her to construct a biodigester, as she has four cows from which she can get fuel for cooking. VEP also sold her a solar package so she can have sufficient light to enable her four children to study in the evening without limitations. \n\nSerah is now an empowered woman and will educate others in her village to embrace green energy as well. With her savings and income from the sale of milk and maize she will comfortably repay the loan.

is 47 years old. He lives in the small village of Gurjaani District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandson. <p>\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, Goderdzi requested loans from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, each time without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nGoderdzi works as an artisan and earns a modest monthly income. His wife works locally as a baker. Their earnings provide hardly enough income to purchase food for the family. According to Credo estimates, their family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nGoderdzi requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Goderdzi has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with lenient conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high-risk borrowers because of their low incomes. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds that he is requesting, Goderdzi would like to begin trading livestock. Specifically, he plans to purchase calves, and to raise and re-sell them at higher prices for profits. He believes that such an operation would significantly increase his family's income. And, as a result, he feel that the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":872.3,"image":{"id":1371111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to start a livestock trading business by purchasing calves and later raising and re-selling them at higher prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Vazisubani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Goderdzi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":910}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":262.3,"local_amount":430,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":434.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613748,"comment":null},{"amount":262.3,"local_amount":430,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":434.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857460,"comment":null},{"amount":152.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":252.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134110,"comment":null},{"amount":146.4,"local_amount":240,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":242.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107697,"comment":null},{"amount":24.4,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":40.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255235,"comment":null},{"amount":24.4,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":40.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019371,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-17T17:07:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":572039,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is married and has children who attend school.

Her loan requests were rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is her husband's and son's monthly salaries. Both of them work as salesmen. But their earnings provide hardly enough income to put food on the table for the family. According to Credo estimates, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Nino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with lenient conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as high-risk borrowers because of their low incomes. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan proceeds that she is requesting, Nino would like to begin trading used clothing. Specifically, she plans to purchase used clothing from the wholesalers in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, and to then re-sell such clothing in Gurjaani at higher prices.  She believes that, by doing so, she will increase her family's income. And in this way, she feels that the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1371127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to begin buying and selling used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gurjaani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-17T21:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-17T21:40:01Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nino","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":37.3},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":39.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.7,"local_amount":29.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":29.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613749,"comment":null},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":33.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":33.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857461,"comment":null},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":34.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134111,"comment":null},{"amount":35.51,"local_amount":35.51,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107698,"comment":null},{"amount":36.14,"local_amount":36.14,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255236,"comment":null},{"amount":280.85,"local_amount":280.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T01:09:21Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":571583,"name":"Maia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maia is a 36-year-old married woman with 1 child.

His father farmed South Texas land. Gerardo ventured off to try other work, but came back to the family business. While Gerardo\u2019s father worked for other farmers, Gerardo wanted to be his own boss. \n\n\u201cI had a little money saved up and I started buying equipment little by little,\u201d Gerardo said. \u201cEvery year, I would get equipment and make payments on my equipment. It\u2019s been a struggle in the past few years, though.\u201d \n\nTo sustain his family and himself, Gerardo works full-time in an office, but he farms when he\u2019s not working in the office. Gerardo currently has a crop of alfalfa. In the past, he grew livestock grass. And before the drought, one of his most profitable crops was chili peppers.  \n\nAt the start of the recession, Gerardo did well investing in a versatile and powerful John Deere tractor that could plow, chisel and level land. Small farmers passing by his 52-acre plot saw him leveling land with ease and asked him to do the same with their land. There were so many requests that leveling land became a significant source of income for his company, A. Custom Work. \n\nBut when Texas got hit with the worst single year drought in history in 2011, Gerardo said as land in South Texas cracked and parched up, his business dried up too. And when the drought continued in 2012 and was sustained through 2013, Gerardo said he faced losing his tractor.\n \nWhile attending a workshop with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension in El Paso, Gerardo met a loan officer from Accion Texas Inc., who advised him on how to refinance the loan into smaller more affordable payments. Using his John Deere swather as collateral, Gerardo obtained a $5,625 loan from Accion to pay off his tractor.\n\n\u201cI probably would have lost my tractor if I hadn\u2019t gotten this loan from Accion Texas,\u201d Gerardo said. \n\nGerardo is toughing out the drought because farming is a way of life and a family tradition. When the drought clears up, he hopes to start growing chili again.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to learn ways to improve myself,\u201d Gerardo said. \u201cWe are all hoping the water situation improves, too.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125.98,"image":{"id":1365669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

First, he worked as an apprentice and then moved to work in a production line for a local manufacturer. When he moved to the U.S. 25 years ago, he continued to pursue his passion for jewelry design and reports by working for several jewelry factories. While he originally operated a jewelry business in a storefront, in 2012 he decided to register as a sole proprietor to begin his business in an existing space, World of Watches, a jewelry store located in a busy shopping plaza in Las Vegas.
