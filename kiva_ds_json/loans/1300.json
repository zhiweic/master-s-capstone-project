She has done farming activities on her family plot since 2008 when she was married. She mainly grew maize and some sweet potatoes that have provided the source of food for her family. However, due to inconsistent rainfall patterns over the years, the returns from the fields are dwindling annually. While she would have tried venturing into tobacco farming to get more cash, as other communal farmers are doing, she cannot. She does not have a big plot and will therefore need to embark on intensive farming. She is starting tomato farming and getting a drip irrigation kit will help her manage the water supply she gets from a nearby well. The cash generated from the tomato farming will help provide cash to purchase food for her family as well as help her purchase a variety of seedlings to increase her horticultural farming venture. She hopes to be able to raise money to get her children into school as well as build an additional bedroom for them on her homestead.  \n\nThis group comes from Goromonzi, a farming area which is close to Harare, and are venturing into horticulture as it made business sense for them.  The group is made up of members between the ages of 23 and 32, with an average age of 26 years.  After their Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program training, they decided to carry out gardening on a commercial basis.  They have been doing their gardening since July 2013. The group members are mostly orphans and now have families of their own.  From the proceeds of their business they intend to raise an income for their families. They would like to request this loan to install a drip irrigation kit and to buy tomato and onion seedlings for their gardening venture.  The group plans to increase their farming area from 1 hectare to 5 hectares over the next 12 months.  They also want to work and ensure that all the group members have individual irrigation kits on their plots to increase their productivity rates. \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program.  PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations, where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments.

They range in age from 24 to 28 years old. The group members are not employed and have been relying on seasonal casual labor and household farming as a source of income. They came together to start this group so that they could make more money from their farming activities. They are undertaking poultry production as their income-generating project, which is located on one of the member\u2019s homesteads. From the proceeds of their project, they will raise income for their families. They intend to use this loan to purchase day-old chicks, point of lay chickens, stock feeds and feeders as well as to construct a bigger fowl run. From the proceeds of the project, they intend to purchase a drip irrigation kit and also venture into market gardening. The group also plans to increase the number of chicks they rear.  With the introduction of market gardening into their business, they aim to supply the local market as well as food outlets. They also would like to use the proceeds from their business to build additional rooms on their homesteads. \n\nEunice (the group leader) is a young woman, age 26, and has two children, a girl and a boy. She currently lives on her own as she is a single mother. Eunice has depended on farming and seasonal causal labor to support her family. With proceeds from this loan, it is her hope that her income will increase and she will save to purchase household assets and build her own house. \n\nPENYA assists borrowers with entrepreneurial skills training through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Program. PENYA also helps them form Village Savings and Loans Associations where they save proceeds from their businesses that will then become the future sources of additional loans and business investments.

Jorge is currently attending the Universidad San Fransisco Xavier, working towards his degree in public accounting & finance. He plans to graduate in January 2014 but without a loan from Vittana, he fears that he will need to defer his graduation. With this loan, Jorge plans to cover the cost of his graduation fees. Often in Bolivia, there are fees for earning your title before graduating. Jorge currently works 40 hours a week as a cashier in a store and earns $8 a day. One of his biggest challenges has been making time to work and go to school. With a degree in public accounting & finance, he expects to earn $15 a day during his first year of work. For his family of four, finances have always been tight.

She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\n\nJentrix is 50 years old and has been a farmer for 25 years. Jentrix works as a farmer to provide for her 11 children. The community and other farmers know Jentrix as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community activities such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.

As an active member in her community, Jentrix also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes leading as well as wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jentrix plans on using future profits from the harvest to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business. Her life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because she has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and the ability to save money and feed the family. \n\nJentrix's group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

Boniface has been a farmer for 25 years and he described his harvest as good last year, but he believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBoniface first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Boniface joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, fertilizer and hybrid seeds and to earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers in his community. Boniface plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Boniface\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to feed the family.\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Boniface and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-16T23:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-14T23:50:12Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boniface","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milcah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":246054,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T16:04:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642888,"name":"Helma's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helma's Group in Busia District.

They came together to stand united for one another and formed this group. They belong to a non-tribal community, and are living here in Manipur state on the outskirts of Imphal East district, located in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nThe woman pictured with a raised hand is called Thoithoi and is the profile representative of the group. She still shares the same kitchen with her in-laws, but did not get any financial support. Her husband is a seasonal farmer. In the off-season, usually, sand sieving is his way of earning income for the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement their income, Thoithoi started her line of weaving activities. She uses a handloom to weave. (A sample handloom can be seen in the picture behind the members.) With her first loan, Thoithoi was able to increase her production as compared to before the loan. The cloth that she weaves includes bed covers, wrap-around skirts, and cloth usable for towels and shawls. She supplies her products at the market at reasonable rates. \r\n\r\nShe is happy that she is in good health to support the family income. With the profit that she earns, she usually puts aside some amount to deposit in the group savings on a weekly basis. In this way, every time she gets a loan, she has been able to increase her production. She has been saving most of her profits, as well as her husband's income, for a separate home very soon. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this weaving activity for the past four years now. Now she needs another loan to continue to do better with her business. She will buy materials required, such as yarn of various colours and textures, to weave wrap-around skirts, shawls, bed covers, etc. She also means to buy the finished products from other weavers to supply at the market for a profit. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members are also making steady improvement like her with their respective income-generating activities. All the members in the group are weavers. Thoithoi says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy stocks of yarns in different colours and textures for weaving, and to buy finished products from other weavers to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:10:07Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thoithoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manisana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prempati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":105000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T16:59:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657679,"name":"Guillermo Le\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guillermo vive en un barrio popular del centro de la ciudad, que se ha visto afectado por la ola de violencia ocasionada por enfrentamientos entre bandas criminales; sin embargo, cada d\u00eda desde las primeras horas de la ma\u00f1ana el sale a trabajar en su propio negocio, un puesto de venta de fritos que inici\u00f3 hace varios a\u00f1os como una alternativa para generar ingresos que le permitieran solventar los gastos b\u00e1sicos de su hogar; all\u00ed ofrece mecato, caf\u00e9 y alimentos fritos como empanadas, pasteles, tortas de carne, bu\u00f1uelos, jugos y gaseosas, entre otros; esto le genera los recursos suficientes para llevar el sustento diario a su familia.\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita lo toma como un apoyo para fortalecer su negocio y mejorar la imagen del mismo, pues con el dinero comprar\u00e1 una vitrina calentadora e insumos al por mayor (verduras, pollo, carne, salsas, caf\u00e9, gaseosas, entre otros), as\u00ed podr\u00e1 cambiar la vitrina deteriorada que tiene y atraer nuevos clientes para ofrecerles una variedad de productos para satisfacer los gustos de los comensales, logrando obtener un mayor nivel de ventas y mejores ingresos.\nGuillermo manifiesta que su edad no le impide seguir luchando para lograr sus objetivos, por ello cada d\u00eda trabaja con m\u00e1s dedicaci\u00f3n y empe\u00f1o para poder cumplir el sue\u00f1o de montar su negocio en un local propio, mejorando las condiciones de trabajo y generando una mayor rentabilidad para ofrecer bienestar y mejores condiciones de vida a su familia.\n","en":"Guillermo lives in a popular neighborhood in the middle of the city, which has found itself affected by the wave of violence caused by confrontations between gangs.

She is a single mother and has three children, none of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been in the business of selling seafood for eight years now. Ever since her mother sent her out to sell and she learned how, she's been a saleswoman all her life. To buy her products, she walks from her home village some 15 minutes to catch a bus that will take her where she needs to go. The bus takes an hour and a half. She buys her merchandise, prepares it, then goes to the city where she sells her goods. She sometimes also sells from door to door in the villages near where she lives. She wakes up at 5:00am to get ready for work, leaves her house at 6:30am, and returns home again at 5:30pm. This is her daily schedule.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in her business through the purchase of 50 lbs of fish, 50 lbs of shrimp, and 25 lbs of crawfish, crabs, and more. This loan will help her by enabling her to purchase more products more cheaply, and will also mean she doesn't have to travel every single day to buy goods, which will leave her more of her income.\r\n\r\nHer dreams include building a house of brick, since the adobe one she has now doesn't work, and buying some land and leaving some of it to each of her children.

With a loan, Karen plans to buy her schoolbooks. Up until now, she has been managing to get by without them, but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, she feels she will be able to get better grades. \r\n\r\nShe expects to graduate in October 2014, but without a loan, is unsure how she will be able to continue affording her education.

Cuenta que hace tiempo era trabajadora de una se\u00f1ora que distribu\u00eda sus prendas de vestir en un conocido centro comercial de la ciudad, pero con el paso de los a\u00f1os se dio cuenta que ella tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda realizar sus propios dise\u00f1os y es as\u00ed como emprendi\u00f3 esta nueva etapa.

She is a mother to one son, who depends on her for care and protection and to help him to prosper. Raquel owns the house where she lives and it is there that she is fighting to improve her living conditions. Raquel works making clothes of her own designs - she works with cotton and Lycra. Little by little Raquel has established a small but very productive workshop in her home where she designs and produces different clothing items. She tells us that some time ago she worked for a woman who sold her clothes in a well-known shopping centre in the city. As time went on, Raquel realised that she, too, could make her own designs and so she started this new stage in her life. She has now been doing this work for ten years and what she most likes about it is that she has money coming in every day. She also has free time with this work. Raquel is very happy with her loans from MicroFinanzas Prisma as she says that the interest rates are very low. In the future Raquel would like to have a larger workshop and to be able to hire another woman to help her. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Raquel is applying for a loan of 800 Nuevo Soles. She is very grateful for this loan as she started with just one sewing machine but now she has two darners and two other sewing machines. Raquel says that she is very happy with her group as everyone adheres to their commitments. \r\n\r\nRaquel will use this loan to buy material, threads and elastic, which she will use in her daily work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy material, threads and elastic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":116.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":127.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":132.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.23},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":139.63},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":146.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T23:01:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646918,"name":"Martin Bosco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Martin pertenece al municipio de  Niquinohomo, municipio que fue elegido para el programa de creaci\u00f3n de alianzas para el fortalecimiento de las capacidades locales para el saneamiento de Nicaragua, es casado, con  45 a\u00f1os de edad,  Profesional, comerciante trabaja una peque\u00f1a pulper\u00eda desde hace 8 a\u00f1os.

Her passions have always been animals, going fast, and getting to know places, which is why she wanted to be either a flight attendant or a zoologist when she grew up.\r\n\r\nShe started attending a school near her home. As she was a dedicated little girl, her principal decided to promote her from fourth to sixth grade. This complicated her life a bit as she encountered new and more difficult ideas which left her less time to spend with her friends.  When she was 11, a neighbor talked to her about the things he was doing as a member of an aid group that he belonged to, the Civil Defense. She decided to enroll, and discovered many things that she had been unaware of before. With this motivation, she continued to attend every Sunday for four years. By the age of 15, the things she was learning had started to change. She met people who taught first aid. At first, she just learned these things, but didn't pay much attention. But over time and after meeting some of her instructors who were nurses, she became enthusiastic about becoming one of them, about saving lives, and she began to feel the same dedication that they showed.\r\n\r\nHer desire to keep learning decreased her anxiety and her childhood wishes to become a flight attendant or zoologist, replaced by her wish to be a nurse and help people. She was surprised that what she learned in the Civil Defense had become the basis for choosing her current passion.\r\n\r\nAt 16, she had achieved part of her goal by graduating from high school and she started looking for a place to study nursing. She looked at various places and enrolled at Campo Alto, where she is currently studying. She is now in her third semester and is seeking support from Kiva so she can continue in her trade and in the Civil Defense.\r\n\r\nShe has decided that she would like to specialize in pediatrics and is gaining depth in her chosen profession every day.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"pay for a semester of higher education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T00:50:03Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":870000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-16T01:59:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646399,"name":"Lodela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lodela is 54 years old and married with three children.

","en":"Gulnora was born in 1969. She is widowed with three children. Five months ago she started a cattle-breeding business. She is successfully developing it; her son is helping her get it going.

She has chosen this business as there is no other grocery store in her locality.\r\n\r\nNow she aims to improve her grocery shop due to the increasing demands of her customers. But to expand her business, she needs capital.  So she applied for a loan from BJS to buy grocery items to meet the demands of her customers and at the same time, improve her financial stability and impart a proper education to her children.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to both BJS and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1491189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more grocery items to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-12-17T01:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T01:50:17Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalpana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T05:14:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646418,"name":"Rukia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukia is a 35-year-old married woman.

From opening a day care to a kids\u2019 jumper rental company, he\u2019s always found a way to use his entrepreneurial spirit to bring a smile to kids\u2019 faces. That\u2019s why, when inspiration hit to open a soft-serve ice cream truck, he knew he had to do it. \r\n\r\nHe opened NEU Flavor Ice Cream modeled after the Mr. Frosty soft serve trucks that many kids grew up with on the East Coast.  Expanding his menu to include treats such as banana splits, floats and Hawaiian shaved ice, James has a menu that would satisfy any sweet tooth.  For James, it\u2019s not just about seeing the kids smile, but helping recapture the childhood memories of all the adults who frequent his truck. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that doesn\u2019t like an ice cream truck,\u201d said James.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two trucks in James\u2019 fleet, and he does both catering and traditional ice cream truck rounds in neighborhoods, where kids eagerly wait for the all too familiar jingle.  He wants to expand his business to do more corporate catering and is using his $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase a pushcart where he can serve personalized frozen treats at corporate office parties and socials.\r\n\r\nThere are not many soft serve trucks in the San Diego market and in the future, he wants to expand to several trucks and have multiple employees.  His ultimate business dream is nothing flashy; he just wants to provide a stable future for his wife of 11 years, their two kids, and the kids that they foster.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just a humble guy who values hard work and I appreciate people who appreciate my business,\u201d said James. \u201cIt\u2019s why I love what I do.\u201d\r\n\r\nCheck out NEU Flavor\u2019s website: www.neuflavoricecream.com\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":" to purchase a pushcart to serve personalized frozen treats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Diego","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T02:30:03Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":162,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.06},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.37},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.98},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.45},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.37},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.76},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.98},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.37},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.57},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.01},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.45},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.46},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T14:06:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657761,"name":"Raff Yuro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raff Yuro is married with two children.

The presence of well-equipped classrooms, computer laboratories equipped with the latest technology, and an unimaginable library with limitless possibilities for knowledge are just some of the reasons I want to attend.\r\n\r\nI want to study International and Business Law because knowing the law of a country gives a person knowledge about her society and culture.

is Eva, 39, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Narding and a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEva owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying *boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of her jeepney unit.\r\n\r\nEva hopes to expand her business and dreams that her children will finish their studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship** members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n*In the boundary system, the driver pays the jeepney owner a fixed amount (the \u201cboundary\u201d) for driving a passenger vehicle for 12 hours. It is as if the driver is renting the vehicle. What he earns from passenger fares above the \u201cboundary,\u201d minus what he paid for the gas and oil, is his take-home pay.\r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T04:10:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T05:13:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":646978,"name":"Mujeres Unidas De Colonia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mujeres Unidas de Colonia est\u00e1 en el 1er ciclo del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, donde todas trabajan y se ayudan por salir adelante.

Later this dream faded, and I started to love reading and writing. Therefore I have chosen to study journalism.\r\n\r\nI think that journalism offers an opportunity to constantly develop and not stand still. Since childhood I have been very curious. I liked to compose short stories and then tell them in the afternoons to my parents and at night to my toys. \r\n\r\nIn addition, journalism is a true art. I think that the ability to write to inform society requires lots of talent. Journalists are always in the center of events, and they have to interpret the events for the reader. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I consider journalism like an adventure not only around the world, but also in knowing yourself.

I work in the Finance Department for Juhudi Kilimo, an agricultural micro finance institute in Kenya. Previously, I  worked for Turame Community Finance, in Burundi as the Finance and Administrative Director. I have been in the micro finance industry for over 12 years and I like the industry because this is where poverty, food security and health issues are well addressed. \r\nI am the first born in a family of nine, married and I have three children who are in school. When I finished high school, I started my career in accounting and managed to educate my siblings from the salary. I did so because my mother had minimum resources to educate them. After they all finished high school training, I decided to go back to school to pursue a degree in finance and later pursued my MBA, both of which I financed through bank loans.\r\nI am motivated to do a study related to the factors hindering financing for rural, small-scale farmers. I believe that this study will highlight the gaps in agricultural financing and will give practical recommendations on how financial institutions could provide appropriate financial and nonfinancial services to rural farmers in Kenya. I hope to bring the study results back to Juhudi and align it with the business growth strategy for the next four to five years. I also hope to be able to share the findings of my research with other Kiva partners in order to improve the financial product design at other MFIs to benefit loan recipients in the region.

The reason I am seeking a loan to finance my MBA is because I am the sole bread winner in my family following an accident that rendered my husband jobless in 2010. I have two teenagers who are in high school and therefore my income is stretched managing the family affairs.\n\nAfter high school, I worked for 4 years as a secretary but I felt I had capacity to do more. I developed a strong liking for the HR profession working as a Personal Assistant to an HR and Admin Manager, and it is then I decided to enroll for a diploma in Leadership and Management. I got a diploma in Leadership and Management and from there on my career in HR started. I grew within the ranks of HR profession from a Personal Assistant, HR Assisant, to HR Officer. To move from the position of a HR Officer required a degree and I enrolled for a Bachelor of Science in Leadership and Management where I got first class honors. I was promoted to the position of a Senior HR and Training Officer in 2009.\n\nI joined Juhudi Kilimo in mid 2012 as a Human Resource Manager and what really attracted me to Juhudi is their core business of financing rural farmers. Having worked in a pure for profit organization and in particular healthcare, my desire was to join a social enterprise that would focus on the development of our customers in a sustainable manner. I fell in love with Juhudi's mission, their client focus and the impact they were creating in the society. I was also excited to join Juhudi because they did not have a HR function and they wanted me to set it up and this was a great opportunity for me to put in to practice my years of experience as a HR.\n\nJuhudi is at a point in time that it requires a strong and very skilled leadership team who will be able to deliver on our promises to our farmers. As an executive heading the HR function, I will benefit greatly from the Masters in Business Administration from USIU which will give me hands on experience in functional areas related to HR like Finance, Marketing, Strategy and Entrepreneurship. I choose the Global Executive MBA from USIU as it focuses on managers who hold senior positions and the approach is very hands-on and work based. I am therefore able to transfer the newly acquired skills and knowledge into my day to day activities, creating a greater impact that Juhudi will need in the next 3 years as it scales up.\"

He lives with his wife and son. Antonio is in the process of converting from conventional to organic coffee farming. To reinforce this process, he needs to buy a grinder, a scythe, and stationary equipment, tools that will help him to improve work on his farm, and increase both his production and the quality of his coffee. This investment will cost him 4,000,000 pesos. \r\n\r\nHis long-term goal is to become a complete, fully organic farm, with both major and minor species to make organic fertilizers and improve the nutrition of his family. He also dreams of being certified as an organic grower by the FCC (Federaci\u00f3n Campesina del Cauca, or Cauca Farmer's Association).  He is convinced that clean and healthy farming is worth the trouble. On a family level, Antonio wants to keep training himself on organic farming and support his son as he studies for a career that will help bring technology to the farm and improve its processes.\r\n\r\nThe conversion and production of organic coffee is a key process toward a long-term that is independent, healthy, balanced, and friendly with respect to the environment. This represents a challenge for the farmers of Colombia, and Antonio has decided not to risk his health, his family's, or his consumers' by continuing to use chemicals. The FCC is convinced that it's worthwhile to support and strengthen these alternative initiatives.  A loan from Kiva represents a sustainable future for his production, his land, and his family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1508864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"switch over to organic coffee farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Popayan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":330,"posted_date":"2014-01-16T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-15T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":62,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2016-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2017-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800000},{"due_date":"2018-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415},{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":415}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T15:25:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657787,"name":"Samra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samra is a 22-year-old woman who is living in Lahore, Pakistan.

is a freshman in the Software Engineering Program. This is his story:\r\n\r\nI have chosen to become a programmer. Ever since I was a child, I have taken a deep interest in computers and electronics. I not only like to play computer games, I am also very curious about the process of game and program development. This was one of the reasons my parents sent me to the physics and mathematics lyceum #61, where I studied from the 1st grade. While studying at school, I attended a programming course at Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radio Electronics. I also studied the basics of such programming languages as Visual Basic, \u0421++, Turbo Pascal and Delphi. For further motivation, I participated in a number of competitions (Olympiads) in mathematics and informatics: the Lomonosov Olympiad, as well as School and City Olympiads on informatics. In 2013, I took third place in the AUCA informatics competition, which gave me a partial scholarship.\r\n\r\nAside from programming, I like to read sci-fi books, play chess, and devote my free time to physical activities, such as practicing aikido, wushu, and football. When it came to choosing a university, I knew that the AUCA was exactly what I needed. Not only because it is the best and most prestigious university in Kyrgyzstan, but also because it provides opportunities for all-around development of an individual and improvement of leadership skills through a number of intellectual contests and cultural events. This allows young people to become more communicative and self-confident, which is very important for better social integration and competitiveness on the labor market.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1491933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Actualmente el mismo est\u00e1 sufriendo sedimentaci\u00f3n y el caudal se est\u00e1 secando, es por eso que en asamblea resuelven firmar un contrato de perforaci\u00f3n de pozo con una empresa, tienen necesidad de 80 mil litros de agua d\u00eda y construcci\u00f3n de tanque elevado para la recepci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n de la misma, para ello tienen parte de sus recursos en una cuenta de ahorro, pero para completar el monto necesitan un cr\u00e9dito. El vecindario ha crecido hasta m\u00e1s de 250 familias y actualmente por razones de abastecimiento no cubren esta diferencia.  Es un barrio que poco a poco y con aportes propios est\u00e1 encarando diferentes obras de mejoramiento para lograr una mejor calidad de vida para todas las familias que habitan la comunidad. La directiva actual est\u00e1 conformada por la se\u00f1ora Martha, Ada, Rosario y el se\u00f1or Rober, que son los representantes para la gesti\u00f3n.

It is currently comprised of 187 members who have connection to the water distribution system.  This was financed years ago by the government and with contributions from each one of the neighbors.  This is for the drilling of a well and an elevated storage tank.\n\nIt is now suffering from sedimentation, and the flow is drying up.  That is why, in assembly, they resolve to sign a contract with a company to drill a well.  They need 80,000 liters of water a day, and they need to build an elevated tank to keep and distribute the water.  To do this, they have part of their resources in a savings account.  However, in order to complete the amount, they need a loan.\n\nThe neighborhood has grown to more than 250 families.  Currently, the are not covering the difference because of supply.  It is a neighborhood that, little by little, and with their own contributions, is addressing different works of improvement in order to achieve a better quality of life for all of the families that live in the community. \n\nThe board of directors is comprised of Martha, Ada, Rosario, and Rober.  They are the representatives for the administration.
