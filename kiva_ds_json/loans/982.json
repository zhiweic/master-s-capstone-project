","en":"William is a 32 year old man with a primary school education.  He is married to Martha, 32, and they have a 7 year old daughter named Heidi.  They live in Latacunga, capital of the Cotopaxi province, one of the provinces that form part of the Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador.  In recent years, Latacunga has developed so remarkably that it is considered one of the most important towns of the region thanks to the floral, mining, metallurgy, agribusiness, agriculture, and livestock industries.  In addition, there are business establishments that generate interesting income, making it a commercial city offering many opportunities to get ahead.  In this city, many of the festivals retain the deep roots and purity very close to historic origins and ancestral traditions.  These celebrations beckon people from across the country, turning this city into the meeting point of the provinces.  Latacunga is the home of construction materials that are distributed from here to across the country.\r\n\r\nWilliam has been making cement blocks for 13 years.  He learned how to manage this business thanks to the support of his family who has always been engaged in this business.  He puts in eight hours a day and his wife helps him.  He believes that mixing all of the ingredients is hard work and for this reason, when he has free time, he helps his colleagues from other \u201cbloqueras\u201d with their activities.  He has experienced several losses during his years in business, the first due to theft of his blocks and materials, and the second because of irresponsible customers who hadn\u2019t paid on time.  However, William has gotten ahead and provided his wife and daughter with a good lifestyle.  Now, he needs a loan to purchase materials in order to increase brick production and add to his profits.  This will allow him to give his daughter the education that he himself could not enjoy.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa provided him with the flexibility and confidence to obtain this loan. In addition, they have provided him with personal advice in the proper management of his resources.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1220980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to

She works in agriculture, specifically the raising and selling of chickens. She has several years of experience working in the area, and has gained a lot of experience that allows her to earn more money. Her small chicken farm is in her home.

This way his coffee-producing project will be able to generate more income to help his family.\r\n\r\nLuis is an outstanding man known in his town for his great hardworking spirit.  He doesn't have the necessary capital for his purchase or for labor because he has a low income and no way to get the necessary money.  This is why he requested a loan, and it's the first one he has received from FUDECOSUR.  He had not had other loans before from state banks, but FUDECOSUR offered him a loan with better terms and a much lower interest rate.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":522.58,"image":{"id":1228815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy supplies for the coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Altamira, Biolley","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2012-10-31T23:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-30T23:00:11Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.49,"local_amount":27271.08,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":28211.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322988772,"comment":null},{"amount":74.52,"local_amount":35976.71,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":37216.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339515871,"comment":null},{"amount":69.74,"local_amount":33667.94,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":34828.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347067725,"comment":null},{"amount":81.54,"local_amount":39363.48,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-20T08:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":40720.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365070558,"comment":null},{"amount":57.18,"local_amount":27603.86,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":28555.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410089275,"comment":null},{"amount":183.11,"local_amount":88399.32,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-21T09:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91446.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-03T20:28:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":491657,"name":"Gricelda Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Griselda se dedica  a su negocio de granja de pollos.Tiene veinticuatro a\u00f1os de edad, tiene un hijo de tres a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada vive en casa propia, la granja de pollos le permite obtener los ingresos necesarios para sobre vivir, tiene dos a\u00f1os de dedicarse a este rubro, lo aprendi\u00f3 por iniciativa  propia  y puso el negocio con su esposo.\nEsta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo ya que necesita comprar pollos de engorde y concentrado, para incrementar  el inventario  de pollos para aumentar sus ventas.

She has worked with Banco Mujer\u2019s \u201cEmprendedoras de Chilamate\u201d communal bank in the past but on this occasion to support her new activity she\u2019s opting for an individual loan.  She lives with her husband and two minor children who attend elementary and secondary school.\r\n\r\nShe rises very early to prepare her husband\u2019s food for work and send her son to school.  Then she does her housework and in the afternoon she sells via catalogue and collects payments; she also picks up merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer main activity is catalogue sales and with profits from this business she\u2019s been buying other catalogue products.  This activity of selling in the community produces additional household income.  In face of the success she\u2019s had, she wants to invest this loan to expand the range of products she has to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nAmong her goals is to become organized enough to have a larger, more stable business because one of her weaknesses is the area of marketing.  She wants to negotiate her contracts better to earn higher income for her family.  To date her business has been going very well.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":627.93,"image":{"id":1228867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMercily hopes to be able to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education.  She also prays for good health to be enjoyed by everybody in her house. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":778703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

Es considerado un cant\u00f3n muy fuerte en la agroindustria y exportaci\u00f3n de varios productos como palma africana, macadamia y palmito por lo cual un aproximado de m\u00e1s de 300 millones de d\u00f3lares se mueven solo en este cant\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una fuente de econom\u00eda, pues hay lugares que son visitados y los habitantes del pueblo aprovechan este movimiento para comercializar todo tipo de productos con negocios establecidos en cada rinc\u00f3n como restaurantes, tiendas, farmacias, almacenes de ropa, tours, etc. Sin embargo en \u00e9poca de invierno, grandes porciones de terreno y plantaciones se ven afectadas por las fuertes e inevitables lluevan que llegan al lugar. Las p\u00e9rdidas que se presentan en esta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o muchas veces son irreparables, pues muchas familias viven en construcciones de ca\u00f1a muy d\u00e9biles para resistir las torrentes aguas. \nA pesar de esto, los ciudadanos de este cant\u00f3n no se dan por vencidos y para remediar de alguna forma las p\u00e9rdidas, contin\u00faan trabajando buscando oportunidades para salir adelante de alguna forma, por lo cual son considerados personas emprendedoras en todo \u00e1mbito como lo es Carlos quien se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de maracuy\u00e1 y cacao frutas muy cotizadas a nivel nacional e internacional. Lleva 2 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y ha adquirido mucha experiencia sobre todo porque dedica al menos 8 horas cada d\u00eda en las labores de sembrar, cosechar, preservar, fumigar y cuidar los cultivos de estas plantas. Su padre fue quien le ense\u00f1\u00f3 a buscar el sustento de esta forma y adem\u00e1s le brinda su ayuda en lo que pueda. Carlos se siente preparado para avanzar un paso m\u00e1s en este emprendimiento y cree que es posible un incremento de ingresos con la adquisici\u00f3n de semillas e insumos que le permitan incrementar su producci\u00f3n y por ende, la oferta para sus clientes. Es por esto que ha solicitado un cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para poder dar este gran paso. Ellos le atendieron con mucho carisma y agilidad lo que le dio confianza y adem\u00e1s proyecci\u00f3n pues las capacitaciones que all\u00ed brindan son de mucha utilidad para los microempresarios de la zona. Con estos ingresos extras Carlos piensa separar un ahorro que en el futuro pueda sustentarle para comprar un terreno grande donde pueda ampliar sus cultivos y as\u00ed brindar la mejor educaci\u00f3n y calidad de vida a sus hijos.","en":"Carlos, 26, went to high school. He has two children, ages 5 and 3, with whom he lives in La Concordia, a canton in the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas which used to be part of the province of Esmeraldas. It's considered a strong region for agriculture and export of products like African palm, macadamia nuts, and palm hearts, which bring in more than $300 million dollars in this canton alone. Tourism is also part of the economy, as the locals in the visited areas take advantage of the tourists to sell all kinds of products, with businesses like restaurants, stores, pharmacies, clothing stores, tours, etc on every corner. Nevertheless, in winter a lot of the land and plantations are affected by the strong and inevitable rains that arrive here. The losses that they are facing in this season of the year are often irreparable, since many families live in structures made of sugar cane that are too week to resist the torrential rains.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, the residents of this canton will not give up, and they will keep working to make up for the losses as much as possible, looking for opportunities to get ahead in some way. They are widely considered to be determined people, like Carlos, who grows passion fruit and cacao which are very sought-after at a national and international level. He has been doing this for two years and has acquired a lot of experience, above all because he works at least 8 hours a day planting, harvesting, preserving, fumigating and caring for the crops. His father taught him to earn a living this way, and helps him as he is able. Carlos feels prepared to take his business a step further and believes it's possible to increase his income by buying seeds and inputs that will let him increase his production and therefore the supply for his customers. \r\n\r\nFor that reason he has asked for a loan from Fundacion Alternativa, so that he can take this next stop. The Foundation attends to him with a lot of charisma and agility, which gave him confidence and also a sense of protection from the very useful trainings for local small businesses. With the extra income, Carlos wants to start saving to buy a larger piece of land in the future where he can increase his crops and thus give his children a better education and quality of life.

","en":"Cristina is 26 years old, has an elementary-school education and is a single mother. She has a small son, who despite her meager resources has been able to make headway and doesn't lack food, clothing or shelter, all thanks to Cristina's enterprising spirit. They live in Santo Domingo, the provincial capital of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, one of the provinces in Ecuador that recently has experienced high and sustained growth. The most appealing aspect of the city is its delicious fruits, and it has many tourists destinations to visit. It also relies considerably on commerce, since it has turned into an important commercial center connecting the mountain and coastal regions of the country. There are a number of tourist activities for travelers near and far alike thanks to its warm climate. Cristina owns a store where she sells casual clothes, gifts for all occasions, cosmetics and other items. She undertook this idea two years ago despite a lack of capital, and little by little she reinvested her profits into the business.

Most of Arline\u2019s customers are neighbors from the area.  They visit her shop in order to buy her products, but they also ask her to come up with custom designs that meet their personal tastes.  Arline sells her products on credit and for cash.  She works Monday through Sunday from 7:00 A.M to 7:00 P.M.  Her main goals are to expand her business and to hire employees to help with increasing production and sales.  During the five years she has been in business, her greatest challenge has always been getting quick access to operating capital.  \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Arline is applying for a Kiva loan so that she can buy materials such as genuine and artificial leather.  She will also buy corn so that she can increase her production of \u201cbollos\u201d.  \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1228180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy shoemaking materials, such as genuine and artificial leather, as well as corn for her food business.

is 36 years old and lives in the town of Mukono, in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has two children, with one of them currently in school. For the past two years, Pollie has been working hard to manage her boutique, which sells scarves, blouses, and baby clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Pollie has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda.

He lives in Latacunga, the provincial capital of Cotopaxi, one of the provinces that forms part of Ecuador's mountain region, which has developed into one of the most important areas thanks to the agricultural, mineral, metallurgical and livestock industries. There are businesses that generate considerable income and have made Latacunga a commercial city with various opportunities for advancement. Although there is a high level of poverty, the enterprising spirit of the inhabitants has made it stand out. In the rural and urban areas one can find families taking advantage of their talents to launch a business idea that can earn the daily bread. This is the case of Luis, who at his young age is already the owner of a small restaurant where his passion for the national cuisine is on display. The need for stable work made him pursue this venture two years ago, and he works eight hours every day at his restaurant. Now he sees the need to remodel and expand, which despite his efforts has its costs. He is sure that his customers will feel more comfortable and get better service, which is why he is requesting a loan to purchase the supplies needed to carry out this objective. He turned to Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, where he found a good option to look for help, since aside from the loans, they also have training so people like Luis have the skills to better administer their businesses.

He works between eight to 10 hours a day out of a small space in his home designated for this work that is so important for him and his family, since it pays for his children's education and basic necessities. Luis makes interesting pieces of furniture and ornaments that he sells for reasonable prices.

The majority of the group\u2019s members work selling morocho, which is a typical dish made with milk, morocho (a type of corn) and sugar. Their activities preparing the morocho begin very early.  Later they walk through the city market selling it. They live in Cuenca, a city that has both colonial and modern architecture.  Its rugged geography offers many places to enjoy nature. The people of Cuenca still maintain their cuisine, culture and traditions.  They are warm-hearted, friendly people.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Ms. Mar\u00eda Liliana.  She is requesting her fourth loan with the Corazones Unidos communal bank, a group that she likes a lot because it is very united and caring.  They live in the Arenal sector of Cuenca.  She is 33 years old.  She is separated from her husband, but has 2 children from the marriage, a 14-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Her daughter is studying in high school and her son is in a small, local school.  She does not have her own house.  She lives in a rental home.\r\n\r\nShe has lived in Ecuador for the past 7 years, although she is a native of the neighboring country of Peru.  She came to our country for work and settled in Cuenca. For the past 4 years, she has sold Omnilife natural products.  She works every day, but does not have a set schedule.  She offers her products whenever she gets the chance.  Every morning, she sells aloe water (medicinal waters). \r\n\r\nHer new loan will be used to buy Omnilife natural products to continue her business, since she already has her own customers.   \r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":1211758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"To buy Omnilife natural products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T07:03:55Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T07:03:55Z","loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfonso Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Federico Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Ermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3832.4,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":319.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":319.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":962.51,"local_amount":958.11,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":962.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990878,"comment":null},{"amount":641.67,"local_amount":638.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":641.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127250,"comment":null},{"amount":641.68,"local_amount":638.74,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":641.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339517716,"comment":null},{"amount":641.67,"local_amount":638.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":641.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069536,"comment":null},{"amount":962.47,"local_amount":958.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":962.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815639,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T09:11:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T13:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481461,"name":"Florenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florenda engaged herself in a hog-fattening business.

Seeking to improve this situation, Mar\u00eda is looking for a loan to buy a hair dryer, a hair straightening iron and supplies like hair color and hair treatments.  In this way, she will be able to offer better customer service which will lead to improved sales.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a great business that will lead to improved quality of life at home so that her two children can have access to better quality education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1213390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a hair dryer, a hair straightening iron and supplies like hair coloring and hair treatments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T07:04:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T07:04:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Romelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":57045},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":58637},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":60273},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":61954},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":63683},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":65460},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":67286},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":69164},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71094},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73077},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75116},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":77211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.98},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.07,"local_amount":115682,"processed_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":117029.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323030009,"comment":null},{"amount":34.32,"local_amount":61014,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":61724.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331166085,"comment":null},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":61213,"processed_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":61925.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548630,"comment":null},{"amount":36.78,"local_amount":65384,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:49:42Z","rounded_local_amount":66145.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098505,"comment":null},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":64808,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":65562.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517726,"comment":null},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":68485,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":69282.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364551945,"comment":null},{"amount":38.82,"local_amount":69014,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":69817.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373513672,"comment":null},{"amount":165.61,"local_amount":294400,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":297828.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382164336,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-13T08:52:15Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T08:57:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482301,"name":"Andrea Estefania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Andrea estado civil soltera, no tiene hijos .Ella cuenta que su familia era comerciante .Ella comenz\u00f3 de a poquita mercader\u00eda pero ahora tiene un local de venta de ropa  ,blusa, por lo que  ella quiere es contratar m\u00e1s empleados para su negocio pues ella tambi\u00e9n confecciona las sabanas y tambi\u00e9n quiere un taller de costura.

Later, he got other jobs where he learned to raise cattle, and therefore one day, he decided to start working independently with his own cattle. Nowadays he has some raised cattle with which he hopes to respond to a customer's order, but as another customer has made a large order, Ricardo needs a loan to purchase 5 heads of cattle to respond to the demand of one customer. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to have a big business which generates big profits and therefore to be able to get his own house.

At the same time, she was studying to be a designer.  When she completed her studies, she decided to resign from her job and with very little money, she started her own dress-making business in her home.  The business began with her own line of clothing, but because of problems collecting payments from customers, she had to abandon this idea and began offering dress-making services to third parties.

Its people, like these communal bank members, are kind and very charismatic; they work arduously every day to improve their household finances and they are fighters who work day after day to get their families ahead.\n\nOne of this group's members is Fanny.  This is the third loan she is taking out with the Las Optimistas Communal Bank.  She lives in the Arenal neighborhood of the city of Cuenca.  She is 32 years old, married, and she has two children who are 16 and 13 years old and who attend the city's public school.  Her husband does auto body work for a living and he works in his own shop.  They own their home.\n\nFanny takes care of the household chores and, starting four years ago, she has contributed to the household finances by working at a store where she earns a monthly salary.  She works Monday through Friday from 8 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nShe will use the money from her loan to buy materials such as paint, solder, rivets, etc. for her husband's body shop.\n \nHer goal is to finish her house.\n\nThis time a friend of one of the members is joining them in the photo; she is the woman in the last row standing behind the woman with the tomato-colored poncho.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":1212824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy paint, sold, rivets, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-11-01T07:04:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-01T07:04:31Z","loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Priscila Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3547.84,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":295.65},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":295.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":887.49,"local_amount":886.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":887.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990883,"comment":null},{"amount":591.66,"local_amount":591.3,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":591.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331127255,"comment":null},{"amount":1479.15,"local_amount":1478.25,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069541,"comment":null},{"amount":591.7,"local_amount":591.34,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":591.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815640,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T23:21:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T13:33:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482460,"name":"Laura Maryorie","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Mujeres En Acci\u00f3n.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Laura tiene 53 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n tiene tres hijos, dos mayores y uno de 18 a\u00f1os de edad el mismo que estudia en universidad.
