Santo Domingo es una ciudad relativamente grande en Ecuador, la tercera en tama\u00f1o bas\u00e1ndonos en n\u00fameros poblacionales. La ciudad y su gente se han visto beneficiados por su r\u00e1pido crecimiento en las \u00faltimas dos d\u00e9cadas, los principales propulsores econ\u00f3micos han sido el turismo el comercio y la agricultura. Sin embargo, desafortunadamente el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico no ha sido beneficioso para todos puesto que ha habido un importante segmento de la poblaci\u00f3n que ha quedado al margen de este, adem\u00e1s, ha resultado tambi\u00e9n en el crecimiento de ciertas actividades il\u00edcitas como el crimen y el narcotr\u00e1fico. Santo Domingo cuenta con un clima tropical h\u00famedo y se encuentra alrededor de los 200 metros sobre el nivel del mar. \nNeris estableci\u00f3 su negocio de ventas ambulantes en esta importante ciudad. A ella le cost\u00f3 mucho iniciar su negocio y conseguir los recursos necesarios, ya que solamente completo la secundaria, y sus oportunidades eran bastante reducidas. No obstante con mucho esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n Neris lleva poco m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os con su negocio, y le ha ido bien, cuenta ya con algunos clientes recurrentes.

Si logra esto, Neris podr\u00e1 mejorar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos lo cual le permitir\u00eda subir su nivel de vida y la de su familia. \n","en":"Neris lives with her 4 children in the city of Santo Domingo, a relatively large city in Ecuador - the third largest in terms of population. The city and its inhabitants have benefited from its rapid economic growth during the last 2 decades. The main economic accelerators have been tourism, commerce and agriculture. However, unfortunately economic growth has not benefited all as there is a significant section of the population which has remained on the margins of this growth; furthermore, it has also brought an increase in certain illegal activities such as crime and drug trafficking. Santo Domingo has a tropical, humid climate and is located at around 200m above sea-level.\r\nNeris started her sales business, pedaling her wares as she walked, in this important city. It was difficult for her to set up her business and to obtain the necessary resources as she has completed only her high school studies and, consequently, her opportunities were considerably reduced. However, after great effort and dedication shown on her part, Neris has now been running her business for 3 years. She hopes to open a shop one day and, as such, she needs to sell her goods in greater quantities in order to be able to buy her products at a lower price.

Alicia says that she got her business going thanks to the support of her daughter, Maria del Rosario, who gave her the idea of selling groceries.  Later, they began to buy consumer staples such as sugar, coffee, eggs, chilies, tomatoes and detergent.  Over time, Alicia and her daughter realized that the business was profitable, and they set out to invest more in it.  Now the products they sell the most are: soft drinks, coffee, sugar, tomatoes, onions and eggs.\r\n\r\nIn running her business, Alicia must practice certain qualities, including friendliness to her customers.  She also must keep her store well stocked and organized.  Alicia mentions that one of the things that makes her happiest is that she can rely on the help of her daughter, Maria Rosario, because due to her age she could not arrange all of the merchandise.  But her daughter is always with her, helping her to clean her store.  Alicia says that she is considered to be a special person because she likes to feel useful, in spite of her age, and she has a strong desire to keep working.  She is requesting this loan to buy more groceries to sell at retail.  To her fellow group members, Alicia is \"Licha, la incansable\" (Licha, the tireless one), a role model.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nLeonor- who sells shoes\r\nAlicia- who sells clothing\r\nLorena- who sells hardware products\r\nBlanca Flor- who sells groceries\r\nMartha Elena- who sells groceries\r\nDaniel- who sells groceries\r\nEva- who sells groceries\r\nSocorro- who sells groceries\r\nEsperanza- who sells Mexican snacks\r\n\r\nThey thank the Vision Fund for helping all women, regardless of their age or where they are from.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6625,"image":{"id":1113817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy grocery products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-13T03:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-13T03:10:14Z","loan_amount":6625,"lender_count":239,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca  Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":93000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":6625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":11625},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":11625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.12},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":828.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":828.13,"local_amount":11625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11663.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419141,"comment":null},{"amount":1656.25,"local_amount":23250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":23327.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568725,"comment":null},{"amount":2484.37,"local_amount":34875,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":34991.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301400014,"comment":null},{"amount":1656.25,"local_amount":23250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":23327.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407669,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T18:43:34Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:11:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":436043,"name":"Mumkunat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Mumkunat 51 letnaya pensionerka.

dental clinic together with his father. The building was leased and expenses were high. All equipment was outdated, and no money was available to replace it. Today, Bahodur's business is successful. In order to improve the quality of services for his clients, Bahodur has taken loans from IMON International, whose services he has been using for five years. Currently, he is a highly-qualified specialist in the field of dental prosthetics, and has many clients.\r\n\r\nDue to the highly competitive nature of his business, Bahodur has decided to improve his practice and ordered new dental equipment for his clinic.

She has been accustomed to housework and taking care of cattle since her childhood.  She lives with her parents, sisters, and brother, who always support her.  At the present time, she has three cows, a calf, and eight sheep.  Increasing the size of the herd has been very difficult since the price of feed has jumped and sales of cattle have surged.  Zarbibi also grows agricultural products.

The nine women members of this group live and work on the island of Chira, located in the province of Puntarenas, on the pacific coast of Costa Rica. The women know one another on a deep and personal level, having lived in the same community for the majority of their lives. Throughout the group\u2019s existence, the members have received support and instruction from various public and private institutions, including universities and government bodies in charge of economic development. This will be the group\u00b4s third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. During the group\u00b4s first and second loan, the members demonstrated their ability to make punctual repayments and work well together as a group.   \r\n\r\nThe members of this group have a business producing various arts and crafts that they sell to tourists as well as locals at various fairs and sales events. The women work from 10 am to 4 pm from Monday to Saturday. The work is separated into shifts, allocating some members to production and other members to sales, adjusting to supply and demand as the members see fit.  \r\n\r\nOn the production side, members work in their workshop in order to produce jewelry made out of fruit seeds, rock paintings, and gourd crafts (a gourd is called a Jicara in Spanish, a type of inedible fruit, which the women hollow out and paint, as can be seen in the picture). The gourd fruits are cultivated from the land of the members. \r\n\r\nOn the sales side of things, the women have been successful in earning revenues at various fairs and community events. Additionally, the association has secured an agreement with a local hotel owner who gives tours to her guests.  One stop on the tour is the workshop of the association, whereby observers can view the artistic production process and purchase hand made arts and crafts.  The group members are well aware of the marketing appeal that is generated by having visitors to their workshop; for this reason, one of the groups goals is to use this loan to make improvements to their workplace and make it more presentable, one woman explained, \"the workshop is the face of our business.\" This loan will also be used to invest in work materials and tools, necessary for the production of various arts and crafts, including pliers, ropes, wires, and wood.\r\n \r\nAdilia Maria E. M. is a 29 year-old single mother who lives with her mother and five children on the island of Chira. Adilia, like the rest of the entrepreneurs in this group, is dedicated to her productive activity.  The revenues earned by these hard working women represents a significant portion of family income.  The main obstacle the members face is securing a steady market for their products.  At the moment, sales are sporadic, in good months, the nine members can earn up to $1,000 as a group, in bad months, only $400.  Currently, the group is awaiting the response for an application that has been submitted to the municipality of Puntarenas, which would grant them the right to make sales to tourists on cruise ships.  Various cruise ships dock in Puntarenas, and this represents an interesting opportunity for the group to increase their revenues.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2571.13,"image":{"id":642716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To

is 66 years-old, a widow, and an industrious woman who has been living in Baray district of Kompong Tom province. She is a mother of three children, one of whom live separately with their new family. For Pol\u2019s family, rice farming is the main business, which she can generate her income to support the living needs. However, she just owns and cultivates rice on a few plots of her existing farmland. Therefore, the income seems barely enough to cover her daily expenses due to the high cost of commodities. And recently, her two single children are working in various jobs, a construction worker and a garment factory worker, so that they can help their mother earn the income and raise the family out of poverty.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of a vehicle for commuting to their workplaces, Pol\u2019s children are experiencing difficulties and they have to pay a lot for taking motor-taxi services. To reduce the expenses on transportation fees, Pol decided to ask for a loan from HKL in the sums of KHR 2,000,000 to purchase a second-hand motorcycle to be used in the family. This loan will take part in developing her family\u2019s living condition.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1115539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase a second-hand motorcycle to be used in the family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Takeo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2012-06-13T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-13T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287353410,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294368721,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301421926,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308182295,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315413571,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T09:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323018880,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-23T10:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":204650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331155137,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":613950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339540142,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-15T20:06:39Z","paid_date":"2013-02-22T09:44:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":437090,"name":"Merly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merly is 53 years old and married with seven children.

She is a well-managed person who always takes care of all household things in a neat and tidy way. She cooks for family, and provides education to her children at home. Besides all this, she devotes herself to feed and look after her pigs every day. For additional income, Hong also acts herself as a middleman who buys matured poultry from local villagers and sells them to frequent customers in local markets.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of a vehicle for use by the family as well as the business, Hong has applied for a loan of $US1,500 to purchase a motorcycle.

She currently has a well-stocked store where she sells basic staple items of daily consumption.  She works Monday through Sunday all day.

For three years, he has had a taxi and has been a taxi driver, which has been a profitable project, but needs more support to cover the costs.\n\nAbdullah is requesting a USD youth loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new motor for the taxi. This will increase the taxi's efficiency, enabling Abdullah to work extra hours and improve his income to ensure a better future for himself. Abdullah is pictured next to his taxi.\n\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

At first it went very well.  With her capital, she was traveling periodically to Maicao to purchase products that come from neighboring Venezuela.  She increased her sales and was able to offer new products.

This caused her to lose time and money, and her sales were affected.  To cope with this challenge, she decided not to travel anymore.  Instead, she sells merchandise based on customer orders, such as bermuda shorts, sweaters, shorts, jeans, and domestic appliances such as TVs and washers, that she buys right here in her city, and she sells mainly on credit.  This business has been well-accepted by her customers, and it has been going so well for her that she wants to buy a greater volume of merchandise with this loan so that she can meet the demand.

With the loan she is requesting, she hopes to better organize her business by buying baskets for displaying her fruits and a larger, more presentable table than the one she has. She also wants to increase the variety of the products she offers at this time.\r\n\r\nErika began working at the shop her mother owned when she was very young; when she established her own household with her life partner and little daughter, she decided to strike out on her own, armed with her great business sense and motivated by a brother who got her the space where her business is currently located. There she started out selling fruit; later, her father (who had taken on running the business because she had gotten a job as a contractor) took advantage of the knowledge he had as a butcher and added the sale of meats to the business. So, with time, the business continued becoming stronger and attracting more customers all the time. But that was not enough for Erika; recognizing that her business was very strategically located, she decided to take advantage of that. She purchased a hydraulic pump and began offering a vehicle washing service, which has been very well received and successful so far. \r\n\r\nErika has her family's help in staffing her business; for that reason, her biggest dream is to continue growing and eventually have a large store that can accommodate everyone and earn greater profits to improve her and her family's quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1116067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy baskets and a table to display the fruits and tubers that she sells, and to expand their variety.

is 27-year-old Patrick.  He has three siblings and is looking forward to getting married and starting his own family.  He runs a business of mobile money transfers in Kasama, a town located in the northern part of Zambia.  \r\n\r\nPatrick grew up in Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia.  He relocated to the town of Kasama to start his own business in December 2011. In the short time that Patrick has run his business, he has managed to grow it from an average of eight customers a day, to thirty.  He believes that the Kiva loan will triple this number within a very short period of time, because it will mean his working capital will increase and he will never have to send away any customers that want to send and receive large amounts of money.  \r\n\r\nHis hopes and dreams are to see his business grow bigger and better.  In his own words, Patrick says he would like to have at least 80% of the people in his new community send and receive their monies through his business.  \r\n\r\nPatrick is hopeful that once he has increased his working capital, he will be able to have even more customers and earn more profits.  The profits he says will put him in a good position to get married and start his own family.  \r\n\r\nIn the video, a representative of Mobile Transactions Zambia (MTZ) interviews Patrick \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1704.96,"image":{"id":1113702,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2604,"youtubeId":"EhBOVAx6t7s","title":"Kiva Borrower Patrick from Zambia","thumbnailImageId":1113702},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To grow his business by increasing his working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kasama","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-06-14T05:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-14T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":158,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":26500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":26500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":178,"local_amount":943375,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":943375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480106,"comment":null},{"amount":543.23,"local_amount":2879103,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2879103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533516,"comment":null},{"amount":598.73,"local_amount":3173250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3173250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533416,"comment":null},{"amount":177.79,"local_amount":942272,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":942272,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281410,"comment":null},{"amount":0.05,"local_amount":288,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":288,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657047,"comment":null},{"amount":107.92,"local_amount":572000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T13:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":572000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373062085,"comment":null},{"amount":99.24,"local_amount":525960,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":525960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381854136,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-27T09:53:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":437247,"name":"Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loan would like to take another loan to buy more food to sell from her stall.

He is married to Gina, a factory worker, and a father to his children. He, together with his wife and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnthony operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Anthony earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He also maintains a buy-and-sell business. He earns a minimum of Php 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nAnthony hopes to be able to expand soon.

es una mujer cartagenera de 58 a\u00f1os de edad que desde muy ni\u00f1a se traslad\u00f3 con sus padres desde su ciudad natal a la vecina ciudad de Barranquilla.  Vive en el barrio Siete de Abril donde se dedica desde hace tres a\u00f1os al comercio de ropa para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os y de perfumes.  Con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado quiere comprar principalmente jeans, perfumes e incursionar en el calzado, ya que cuenta con clientes fijos que le han hecho encargos con anterioridad.  Desde los  14 a\u00f1os sabe lo que es trabajar, empez\u00f3 como empleada del servicio dom\u00e9stico en una casa de familia, lo que le impidi\u00f3 terminar sus estudios de bachiller, sin embargo, sus padres siempre le ense\u00f1aron buenas costumbres y a trabajar para conseguir lo que quer\u00eda.  Cuando ten\u00eda 23 a\u00f1os se une al hombre con el que vive actualmente en uni\u00f3n libre, este es voceador de peri\u00f3dicos ambulante y de cuya uni\u00f3n nacen sus tres hijos, hoy mayores de edad.  Es una familia unida y se colaboran entre s\u00ed para solventar los gastos familiares.  Naida a\u00fan labora como empleada del servicio y sus principales clientes son empleados como vigilantes de edificios cercanos a donde labora, al igual que compa\u00f1eras de oficio, estos le hacen encargos de la mercanc\u00eda y le cancelan quincenalmente cuando cuando reciben su salario.  No teme al hacer la inversi\u00f3n, ya que hasta la fecha con sus clientes le ha ido muy bien y la cercan\u00eda con ellos le permite una recuperaci\u00f3n efectiva de la cartera.  Su principal sue\u00f1o es mudarse a una casa grande donde pueda albergar a toda su familia.  Naida es una mujer luchadora que no se le amedranta a nada, considera que todo lo que emprende le sale bien y hasta el momento no ha tenido ninguna dificultad. ","en":"Naida, 58 years old, is a woman from Cartegenia. At a very young age, she moved with her parents from her birth city to the neighboring city of Barranquilla. She lives in the Siete de Abril neighborhood where, for the past 3 years, she has made a living by selling clothes for women, men, and children, in addition to perfume. \r\n\r\nWith this requested loan, she wants to buy mainly jeans and perfumes, and also venture into shoe sales since her regular customers have made shoe orders. For 14 years, Naida knows what it means to work. She began as a domestic service employee in a family home. This prevented her from completing her high school studies. However, her parents always taught her good habits and how to work in order to achieve what she wanted.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 23 years old, she was united with the man she currently lives with in a common law marriage. He is a traveling newspaper vendor. From their marriage, they have three children, who are now adults. They have a close family and they work together to pay the household expenses. Naida still works as a service employee and her main customers are employed as security guards at buildings near where she works. Some customers are also office workers, who make merchandise orders and then pay for them every two weeks when they receive their paychecks. She is not afraid of making this type of investment since, thus far, everything has gone very well with her customers and the closeness to them allows her an effective profit. \r\n\r\nHer main dream is to move into a large house that can accommodate her whole family. Naida is a hard-working woman who is not afraid of anything. She thinks that everything that she has set out to do has gone well and up to this point, she has not had any difficulties."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1116172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

is from the Akhmeta District of East Georgia. He lives with his family in his village house: his wife Manana, a 19-year-old son, and a 12-year-old daughter. Zakaria requested loans from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and the family's poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nZakaria is an agricultural worker in the village and earns on average 100 Laris per month. His wife works as a nanny in the local kindergarten. The total average monthly income of the family is 350 Laris. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nZakaria requested an agricultural loan from Credo for starting a small-scale agricultural business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to  rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, and who are regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Zakaria will purchase calves. He will grow them and after a year, when the cows start giving milk, he will start producing traditional Georgian cheese. Zakaria and Manana will sell the cheese on the local open market. They have experience in running a dairy farm, as they used to run one, but five years ago the family stopped the business, and sold the cows, as they urgently needed money. \r\n\r\nThe purchased calves will be placed in the old cattle-shed, located in their yard. They will move the grass and prepare hay for feeding the calves in the winter months. As a result of the new business initiative, implemented through the Kiva loan the family's income will increase and they will be able to improve their living conditions.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is the mother of 7 children who she has had to work hard to support because their father abandoned the family when the children were still very young.  She has carried on, though, despite the hardships.  She lives in a modest house in the city of Nazca.  Nazca is known for its mild climate and for the famous Nazca Lines, huge hieroglyphs carved into the hard earth by the ancient Nazca culture and believed to be a sort of calendar.  Farms in the area produce beans, maize, etc.  Nores likes to watch television when she can spare the time for it.  She especially likes telenovelas because they are a happy distraction from her everyday worries.  She would have liked to have gone to college, but her parents couldn't afford it and she was only able to finish a few years of high school.\r\n\r\nNores operates a business selling fruits, vegetables and groceries at a local market.  She works 10 hours a day and sees up to 20 customers.  She says that she is happy with the business and that it is successful because she provides a good service and good products at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nNores is grateful to Kiva lenders because your loans have allowed her to stock the merchandise--onions, potatoes, lemons, beer, mineral water, etc.--she needs to stay in business.

According to Credo estimations, Inga and her uncle belong to the \"vulnerable poor\" category.

Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages providing start-up and re-start credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income levels. \r\n\r\nWith the loan credit, Inga will cultivate her family's 0.4 hectare property. In particular, she will rent a tractor for tilling the land and purchase maize for sowing. Inga will work hard on the plot during the summer to get a good harvest in early fall, and she will sell the harvested maize at the local open market.

She gets very excited whenever it is time to harvest the coffee and treats it as if it were a special event.  Felicitas will hire workers and prepare food for them while they work in the fields.  In addition, she has animal pens where she raises chickens and pigs that are eventually sold once they have been fattened.  According to her, she enjoys working in the fields.
