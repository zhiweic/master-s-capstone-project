Vilma's business is located close to the house where she lives, and she wants to make some repairs [to her business] so that it will be more suitable for her. This is why she has applied to INTEGRAL for a loan, so that she can change the floor at her business location. She also wants to replace the steps at the entrance with a ramp, since she has difficulty going up the steps because of problems she suffers in her legs. With this she hopes to make the access to her work easier. Vilma is a very hard-working person who wants to improve her working conditions and thus be able to continue performing the work which has permitted her to advance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1112281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to repair

Therefore, she is requesting a loan through INTEGRAL, in order to have the money she needs to buy more corn and be able to make more dough for the tortillas.  She will also buy tanks of propane gas.

Due to the difficulty of transportation for her family, Yon is requesting a loan of $800 to purchase a motorbike for commuting, as well as for carrying her cakes to sell. This purchase would enable her to carry larger amounts of cakes faster. In the future, she would like to expand her business and help her children earn bachelor\u2019s degrees. Moreover, she would like to rebuild her present house to make it bigger and more comfortable for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1117191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to purchase a motorbike for commuting as well as for carrying her cake to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap Province","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2012-07-02T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-01T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294392369,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301447094,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308207245,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315438047,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323043152,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331179282,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-28T09:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339561977,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347111676,"comment":null},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T15:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355857310,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":68,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364566310,"comment":null},{"amount":62,"local_amount":62,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372965174,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-02T17:19:19Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T11:04:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":437282,"name":"Guillermo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Guillermo has been a hog raiser for two years.

She has four children and another two other people in her care.  She has been working as a trader in a market in the capital for four years.  Her business is selling fresh food (cocoyam, cassava, couscous).  Jeanne would like to buy bunches of plantains and sacks of cocoyam and cassava in bulk.  She will buy them in the country and re-sell them from different sales locations.  However, her capital is low and will not allow her to do this.  For this reason, she needs a loan to strengthen her business.  This will increase her capital, her sales and her profits.  She will save the profits that she makes in order to buy a motorcycle which will allow her to make home

With the aim of increasing her profits, Rosa would like to start a business selling pupusas, which are made from corn dough and filled with beans, cheese and chicharr\u00f3n (ground cooked pork).  This is a popular, traditional Salvadoran dish and so it is very profitable.  Rosa is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL so that she will have the capital she needs to invest in buying corn, cheese, chicharr\u00f3n, vegetables and everything else she needs to start her pupuseria.  She will also buy a larger quantity of sodas, fruit for making her drinks and supplies for making hot dogs.  This fills Rosa with a lot of hope as she believes that her business will improve."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1113157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, cheese and ground cooked pork for making pupusas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-07-02T17:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-01T17:50:13Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":24.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":27.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":28.24},{"due_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.2,"local_amount":44.2,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:25:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521519,"comment":null},{"amount":22.31,"local_amount":22.31,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":22.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330125,"comment":null},{"amount":23.05,"local_amount":23.05,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":23.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349926,"comment":null},{"amount":24.62,"local_amount":24.62,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":24.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321292,"comment":null},{"amount":27.87,"local_amount":27.87,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":27.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929852,"comment":null},{"amount":27.32,"local_amount":27.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":27.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331924981,"comment":null},{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":26.24,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":26.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846111,"comment":null},{"amount":204.39,"local_amount":204.39,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":204.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356447432,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T20:19:26Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T09:24:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438490,"name":"Cecelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecelia is 49 years old and lives in Buchanan with her four children.

This will be a big help to her because it can improve her business conditions and thus she will have more customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1114389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn in order to make her tortillas ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-07-03T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-02T00:00:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":13.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":13.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":16.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":16.76},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":18.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18.7},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":19.45},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":20.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.96},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.21},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.38},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.45},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13.17,"local_amount":13.17,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521540,"comment":null},{"amount":14.69,"local_amount":14.69,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":14.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301330143,"comment":null},{"amount":31.24,"local_amount":31.24,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":31.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315321311,"comment":null},{"amount":31.47,"local_amount":31.47,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":31.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331924998,"comment":null},{"amount":17.3,"local_amount":17.3,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-17T11:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":17.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339846126,"comment":null},{"amount":51.93,"local_amount":51.93,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":51.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364450633,"comment":null},{"amount":40.2,"local_amount":40.2,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390740725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-03T02:44:30Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T09:35:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439801,"name":"Shazia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shazia is requesting a loan from KIVA partner Asasah for her father\u2019s fruit-selling business.

She makes a living selling tortillas, which she has done for fifteen years.  She has spent much time working in this business and it has given her very good experience.  Juana is proud that her business has been successful.  Her tortilla shop is located in her home and is well known in the area, since the tortillas she sells are the freshest and most delicious.  Juana has many customers who like to buy her tortillas because of their quality and affordable price, and because her service is the fastest.  She also raises cattle, which helps her cover the household expenses.  Juana is very dedicated to her work, and is always on the lookout for new opportunities that could help her achieve greater prosperity in the future.  The demand for Juana\u2019s tortillas has recently increased, and so she wants to increase her production.

She makes a living selling food, breakfast, and lunch. She sells fried plantains, beans, cream, soup, grilled beef, salad, and drinks, among other items. Her business is located in her home and she's had it for several years. With time she has gained a lot of experience in the kitchen and with sales. She has a lot of customers as she prepares the most exquisite dishes in the area. People prefer her because everything is very hygienic, made with the best quality raw materials, at affordable prices, and has the fastest service.
