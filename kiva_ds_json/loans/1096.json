After several years working alongside her mother, she decided to run her own business of buying and selling shoes and clothes. She has been running this business for ten years now and has a good amount of experience as well as many clients. She is able to sell a lot of goods thanks to the high quality of her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking this loan with a view to helping her satisfy her clients. After four group loans and five individual loans, all of which were correctly repaid, she is now on her sixth individual loan, which she plans to use to buy 10 pagnes and 3 crates of shoes. She stocks up in Bamako.\r\n\r\nFatoumata  sells her goods for cash or for credit to a mixed clientele. With this loan, she plans to earn a monthly profit of 60,000 FCFA, which will enable her to repay her loan and continue to run her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":254.55,"image":{"id":1331400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy clothes and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T14:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T14:40:10Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819626,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678522,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924154,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207364,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972010,"comment":null},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624682,"comment":null},{"amount":36.37,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":18183.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850718,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-12T17:11:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546898,"name":"Soklim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soklim is 32 years old and married, with three children.

Surayo herself works in one of the dining rooms in her village. It is very difficult for her but she does not give up and is trying to do everything so that her daughter will not need for anything.

He was born on a country estate since that\u2019s where his parents lived and since then he\u2019s worked in the corrals, in the sugarcane fields, on cotton plantations and growing traditional crops like corn and sorghum; these are activities he does as family tradition.

He owns an irrigation pump and two-inch tubing that he\u2019ll use to water the pumpkin fields.  This is a profitable summer crop that sells at a good price.

She used the previous loan to buy more chairs, increase her food stock, and improve upon her selling place by repairing the floor. She has successfully paid back her loan. She used the profit to cover household expenses and school fees. \r\n\r\nMwanahawa will use this loan to buy a deep freezer to help sell more cold drinks. Her dream is to one day be able to own a big restaurant.\r\n\r\nMwanahawa will share this loan with her loan group, 'Juhudi Group,' with 15 members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":1328313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a deep freezer to help sell more cold drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanahawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khalifani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamedi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saidi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Happy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theresia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":6320000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":395000},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":395000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.32},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.32},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3925,"local_amount":6320000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6352525.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364651113,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T18:24:37Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:40:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546924,"name":"Valentin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentin is 50 years old and married with five children.

Her family\u2019s daily income is about 17,000 KHR but she manages to save about 7,000 KHR each day after daily expenses.\r\n\r\nAng has been with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund, for two loan cycles, and she completely paid back those loans. After the loans, she feels confident that she will make her life better. She is now leading her group to apply for a loan. She is going to use her portion to cover the rental fees of her farmland. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to make a better living and to keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1329489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To cover the rental fees of her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Tbaung Khmum district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-04-12T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-12T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreyrath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-13T18:16:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":546935,"name":"Harriet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harriet is an old client of Ugafode, married to Mr Phillipo and both residing at Cell 5, Ntungamo District.

\n","en":"Gulchehra is a very patient and open-minded person. Her work experience shows on her kind and pleasant face, for she is a teacher, a guide to the world of knowledge. She has worked in this field for 23 years. In all this time, she has taught many students who have become a source of pride for their parents and who express gratitude to their teacher, Gulchehra. She has brought up 4 children of her own, 2 of whom are currently in school, 1 who is doing post-secondary studies, and a daughter who has started her own family. As she and her husband are caring and responsible parents, they are taking an active interest in their children's futures. She is well aware that in order to realise their plans, they need a certain amount of financial resources. With this in mind, she is very careful with the family budget and is saving a nest egg. She strictly controls spending because it is very difficult to bring up 4 children and provide for her own old age on only a teacher's salary. But, like all women, Gulchehra likes to wear beautiful dresses and have a jewelry box full of beautiful things. The end of the school year is approaching and she has decided to buy herself some jewelry as a reward to thank herself for the successful completion of another year of work. However, she does not have enough cash on hand, so she has decided to take advantage of the loan services of MDO Arvand. She hopes Arvand will trust her and lend her the funds that she needs. She extends her gratitude in advance for the support and for the piece of feminine happiness that comes from obtaining a desire.

She lives in a nuclear family in the South Pelengana neighborhood of Segou.\r\n\r\nShe did not attend school for social reasons (coming from a family deeply rooted in traditional values), so  very early on she began to pursue income-generating activities alongside her mother who sold dyed cotton clothes in the banco style called Bogolan. After several years of learning at her side, she decided to opt for trading Bazin fabric because it is very popular in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for the past 10 years and has acquired an extensive experience and a large customer base. Her selling strength is due to her  mastery of the inner workings in this sector,  but also to her affordable prices and the quality of her goods.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital and make more profit, she is requesting a new loan. After a first individual loan was repaid properly, she is on her 2nd individual loan she will use to buy two pieces of \"bazin riche\" (high-quality bazin fabric, 100% cotton).\r\n\r\nShe resupplies in Bamako and resells cash to a mixed clientele.

","en":"Savriniso is a very intelligent and hard-working woman. She is 27 years old. Several years ago, she got married, but the relationship did not work out and she divorced her husband. Savriniso has no children. After her divorce, she returned to her parents' home and currently lives with her mother. Following the divorce, Savriniso started to work as a secretary at a government office. She loves her work and performs it honestly. Her colleagues know Savriniso as a conscientious and kind woman.\r\n\r\nSavriniso spends her money on life necessities.

He is married and lives with his wife and daughter, who are his biggest priorities.  With this loan Fernando plans to buy fertilisers and other products for when he sows his crops.  With this the seeds will grow better and he will have a better quality product. In addition he will use the money to pay labourers to apply the products and to assist with the planting once everything is ready.  This way he will be able to do a good job.  Fernando is planning to take advantage of the good weather conditions and the good state of the ground in the region for these crops.  He will also use his years of experience to manage these basic grains.  As well as buying better products of a higher quality so that the crops develop well and healthy, he will also have a good yield with good production levels in the short term.  He hopes the harvest will generate a good income to look after his family's well-being and education.  He also wants to achieve some personal goals and continue investing in the plantation.

She is married to Arthur, a supervisor, and a mother to their children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their everyday needs.\r\n\r\nLiezel maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers rely on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

She is an elementary school teacher, and she is grateful to her parents, who worked hard so that she was able to study and prepare herself to do work which she is passionate about.  \r\n\r\nIt also was them who taught her the business of farming from the time she was very young.  They taught her how to raise basic crops such as rice, corn and beans.  She continues to do this work along with her husband after her teaching duties are done. Her crops are located on her own property, which enables her to be very vigilant so that she can prevent crop disease and protect her crops from animals and other things that could damage them.  Her crops are commercialized and sold in her local area and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is seeking assistance so that she can buy certified seeds so that she can plant a slightly larger amount on her property. She wants to take full advantage of the free space that she has and put it to good use.\r\n\r\nHer goal in the long-term is to be able to buy another parcel of land, which would permit her to grow coffee, since the region where she lives is well suited for this, given its climate and its soil that is free of chemicals that could damage the seeds.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to have her own capital so that she can work independently and give her children a good education, which will enable them to study at the university level and allow them to have careers.

Two of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nIsatu runs a local food business; she sells coconut, rice and gari. She has been running this business since 2001. She works at the business 10 hours per day and 7 days per week.  Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network in her area of operation.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan, which she will use to buy more coconut, rice and gari, to increase her business. The extra income from this loan will allow her to have a permanent business location and educate her children. In the future, she plans to open a shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1329625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

from Sierra Leone! This is 50-year old Fatmata from Tombo of the Western Rural Area District. She is married with three children between the ages of 9 and 27 years. Two of her children are attending school. \r\n\r\nFatmata runs a little table business at home: she sells cigarettes, soap, milk, gari and sugar. She has been running this business for 4 years. She works at the business 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. Her major challenge is insufficient capital to run her business. \r\n\r\nFatmata has requested a loan in order to buy more general stock like cigarettes, soap, milk, gari and sugar. The extra income from this loan will allow her to change their living conditions by having the means to eat daily. In the future, she plans to change her business from a small box to a shop.

Throughout her entire schooling, she attended a very good school where she met great friends and classmates.\r\nShe's currently 19 years old and studying financial accounting. She studies in an institution where she has obtained a great deal of knowledge which she never thought she could grasp. She has also met several friendly people, and the teachers are very good and friendly. She likes numbers, so that's why she chose this career. She hopes to someday get a degree in accounting.\r\nShe enjoys talking to friends and practicing sports such as soccer, volleyball, running and tennis. She likes the colors blue, red and green. She greatly enjoys spending most of her time with her parents and her sister, going for a stroll, playing games, laughing and talking. Later on, these become the most beautiful memories she could have.\r\nShe likes to eat chips, candy and ice cream. She enjoys eating a lot of junk food rather than prepared meals. Also, she hates vegetables because she thinks they don't taste good, and she'd rather have chicken and pasta.\r\nOnce she finishes studying accounting, she hopes to travel to a lot of countries in order to put what she learned to practice in these locations. She also hopes to learn more about each country every day, and make her mark. At age 30 she hopes to own a house where she can live with her family which will be comprised of a husband and two children, a boy and a girl. She'll provide them with the best possible education and teach them how to appreciate everything they have and own, because in order to get ahead it's important to never forget the past.

His loan request was rejected each time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nSergo owns a car. He is renting it out and gets a small monthly income. In addition, the family's income includes Sergo\u2019s parents in-laws' monthly pension. The total income of the family is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n \r\nSergo has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Sergo will purchase a truck for towing cars.

She lives with them in an adobe house.  Thanks to her parents, she has been tied to agricultural work ever since she was a girl.   Their main form of financial support was organic cacao production.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching adulthood, she inherited a plot of land, which she allocated entirely to the production of cacao.  When she got divorced, she managed to get her independence.  However, her greatest difficulty was having the capital that would allow her to buy seedlings to replace the old cacao trees.\r\n\r\nCurrently her land is found to be in a good productive state.  This motivates her to continue investing in a fluid manner.  In the future, she wishes to work with the impetus that she is known for and use her profits to fulfill her dream of improving her house by using sturdy material.  This way she is hoping to improve her children\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva.  She is grateful for the opportunity given to her, and she pledges to make her payments punctually.\r\n\r\nShe now needs to have 3,000 soles to hire workers from the area and to continue with the season for harvesting cacao.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1340673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers from the area.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-13T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-13T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":320.55},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":358.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":368.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":381.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":396.81},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":408.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":423.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":127.94,"local_amount":326.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":329.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530369,"comment":null},{"amount":134.39,"local_amount":343.12,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":346.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975397,"comment":null},{"amount":140.33,"local_amount":358.3,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":361.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996664,"comment":null},{"amount":144.33,"local_amount":368.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":372.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864146,"comment":null},{"amount":149.55,"local_amount":381.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":385.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352512,"comment":null},{"amount":155.53,"local_amount":397.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":400.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904333,"comment":null},{"amount":160.21,"local_amount":409.04,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":413.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090430,"comment":null},{"amount":162.72,"local_amount":415.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":419.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T11:33:51Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":547150,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 37-year-old man who has four daughters. after using his previous loan he was able to improve the cafeteria business and from that he started another business selling birds.

He lives in the village of Chapala, Bolnisi district, with his 56-year-old wife, 33-year-old son and his daughter-in-law. Saiat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land where potatoes, cucumbers and tomatoes are grown. Harvested products are sold locally at the markets and the family gets a small monthly income which is not enough to cover their monthly expenses.\r\n\r\nSaiat requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

is a Peruvian artisan who crafts sterling silver jewelry. She hopes to stock up on sterling silver while its price is low, and to develop a good supply of designs.\r\n\r\nGiuliana has been selling through NOVICA since 2005. This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"As a child, I loved creating my own jewelry to wear at parties, or to give as gifts to friends. In college, I signed up for elective courses in jewelry making, where I learned the essentials of the craft. For me, this was a hobby I kept refining and perfecting. I was still taking courses when my husband passed away. At that point, I quit school to seek a steady job to support my young son. That has been the greatest challenge of my life. I decided to set up my own workshop where I could develop my jewelry designs. My designs speak of tradition yet are modern, and they feature the harmony between metal, pearls and gemstones. I'd like to show the world the hand-crafted filigree styles developed in Peru over the centuries.

She operates a fruits and vegetables stall, a place where she sells goods to make the daily food. Normally she sells to her neighbors.

He is a humble farmer from the Santa Lucia district on the outskirts of Teustepe.  He has been planting corn and beans since he was very young.  He started this activity when he was very young and at ten years old, he worked along with his parents and siblings so that the family could survive.  He was only able to complete primary school.  Currently, he specializes in planting basic grains and breeds livestock in the winter.  He dedicates himself full-time to planting and storing grains to have for the summer season and in this way, he is able to sell during shortage periods.   One of the activities that he needs to strengthen is the livestock breeding but he doesn\u2019t have his own land and so he does not have land that is in good condition.  He needs financing to pay the lease on 3 \u201cmanzanas\u201d [land measure = 1.75 acres] and to purchase insecticide to protect his crops and animal pastures from blight. One of his next goals is to plant watermelon to diversify his crops and to have his own land so that is animals will have better conditions.

She is requesting the loan to purchase sugar, oil, rice, beans, vegetables, clothing, cosmetics, cleaning products, bath soaps, toilet paper, etc.  She wishes to continue improving her business and make it more stable so that she can cover part of the food needs of her customers.  \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1331067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sugar, oil, rice, beans, vegetables, clothing, cosmetics, cleaning products, bath soaps, toilet paper, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Boaco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-04-13T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-13T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melva Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":984.99,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":98.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":98.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364573429,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":98.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373166120,"comment":null},{"amount":100.15,"local_amount":98.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971935,"comment":null},{"amount":99.85,"local_amount":98.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":99.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837301,"comment":null},{"amount":100.01,"local_amount":98.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":100.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860588,"comment":null},{"amount":103.08,"local_amount":101.53,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":103.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349293,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":98.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901419,"comment":null},{"amount":296.91,"local_amount":292.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":296.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550563,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-22T02:27:41Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:14:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":547399,"name":"Pedra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of nine children, Pedra works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from food vending.
