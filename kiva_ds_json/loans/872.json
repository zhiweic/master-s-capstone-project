From the department of Magdalena, she arrived 10 years ago in the city of Barranquilla with her entire family. They stayed in her parents' house, where she developed a business in order to be able to generate income and sustain her family. This was how, with her husband, she put a restaurant in her father's house, locating it on the terrace. Since it was a main road, it made an impression on the clientele, which gradually increased. Today she sells lunches and a range of fried items and spongy bread rolls or dough products made with corn, cheese, and anise, wrapped in baskets. Her dream for later on is to have her own house and to continue organizing her business. Her great challenge was the displacement from her native land to this city and having to immediately start a business in order to generate income that would cover the basic needs of her family. But this is already in the past, and today she concentrates on her future business growth, although with the need for business capital, in order to develop her work in a harmonious way. This is precisely why she is applying for a Kiva loan, with which she will buy raw materials and supplies and replace costly debt.

Su naturaleza campesina y capacidad de sembrar la tierra, en esta ciudad, a la que se hab\u00edan trasladado,  le daba pocas posibilidades de  generar ingresos para sustentar los gastos del hogar, pero sus necesidades fueron superiores y emprendieron su propia aventura de negocios, apoyados por un gran amigo, que les prest\u00f3 el primer capital de trabajo, para que compraran mercanc\u00edas variadas y desde entonces han logrado ampliarlo y seguir so\u00f1ando con mejorarlo aun mas su nivel de vida.

Coming from the countryside her skills were in working the soil which in the city they had relocated to give her few opportunities to generate income to support her home.  But her needs were greater so they started their own business venture with help from a great friend who lent them their initial working capital to buy assorted merchandise.  Since then they managed to expand it and to continue dreaming with improving their standard of living even more.\r\n\r\nShe currently sells hats and all kinds of consumer goods her customers request; she also sells river fish and cookies in particular.   Her market is composed of housewives, small stores and customers referred from other customers located around her neighborhood.  Her goal is to capitalize her business and to obtain income to increase her family\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge at present is the little working capital she has available to increase her clientele which every day increases demand for the products she sells.  This is the reason why she\u2019s calling on her Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy fish to fill her orders and hats and cookies that have

They are all very responsible women who devote all of their efforts towards their families being okay financially.  They chose the name of the group, Valerio, for the place where they live.  It is a large community, which is devoted to growing corn.  The people in this place are sad because there was a recent frost that burned the corn crop.  They believe they will not recover, and it is even worse if it does not rain. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of the group.  She has been in a common-law marriage with Basilio for 15 years.  He works in the field.  Together they have formed a family of five children who are still dependent upon them.  Four of the children go to school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda buys and sells clothes.  During the week she visits her neighbors to offer them a little clothing that she has.  She also takes orders that she will bring from the capital on the week-ends.  She is a very hard-working woman who wants her children\u2019s quality of life to improve.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a loan to buy more wholesale clothes like sweaters, pants, jackets, skirts, and shirts, etc.  This is to cover the pending orders that she has.  The loan will help her stock up on more clothes, and she will have more income.  When the loan comes she will take advantage of it to stock up, and this way she will not need to travel to Mexico City.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda would like to have a car for transportation to other communities in order to sell clothes.  However, she would also love to rent a place to have a stable business and no longer have to walk.  She knows that the rent is very expensive, and she tells us that she has to work a lot more to be able to have a place.\r\n\r\nHer income helps her a lot because she can stock more clothes, she is able to buy clothes, shoes, food, and more than anything, pay the educational expenses.  This is a big help when her husband does not have work.  She helps him with the income from her clothing sales.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda and the rest of the group are very grateful for the support from Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC).  They can now invest in their business activities.  Mariel will invest in clothes, Mar\u00eda, in sheep; Concepci\u00f3n in feed for her calves; Celedonia also in calves;  and Concepci\u00f3n in clothes and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThey are all very happy because of the loan, and they are committed to remain in good standing with the institution and Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":1103194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Valerio San Jose del Rincon.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T23:10:03Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":61000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7625},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1650,"local_amount":22875,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":22970.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419082,"comment":null},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":15250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15313.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568658,"comment":null},{"amount":1100,"local_amount":15250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":15313.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399948,"comment":null},{"amount":550,"local_amount":7625,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7656.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407615,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T13:09:05Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433589,"name":"Mlongo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mlongo is a married woman with four children, two of whom attend school.

He is a person who can talk very comfortably when we comment on his history of success. He was excited knowing we would take the picture. This is why he gave us the interview. In it he tells us that he is 37 years old and lives in a Mazahua community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec. He has been married to Guadalupe for 16 years, and together they have 3 children who attend school. \r\n\r\nIsmael has a shoe store. From the time he was a child, he knew how to sell shoes, since his parents were the founders of the business and of the market where they sell the shoes. Now he has his own business. Although it comes from his parents, Ismael is the one who tends to it and is in charge of it. Ismael is asking for the loan in order to purchase more shoes such as boots, tennis shoes, high heels, sandals, etc., for women, men, girls, and boys. He tells us that the loan will help him a lot since he will be able to invest more in his business and he will not have to worry about buying merchandise for a long time.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the difficulty he is facing is that many times he doesn't sell and due to lack of money, and also because he just went through the illness of his wife, he can't invest more in his business. Regarding this, he also says that he likes the countryside a lot and had sheep and a field of cactus, though he sold the sheep to cover the costs resulting from the illness of his wife.\r\n\r\nBut Don Ismael is a very hard-working and responsible person, and he has goals, such as to push hard with his shoe business, since he remembers that once his shoe sales were very good, and he would like to sell like before in order to improve the quality of life for his children and wife. He thinks that due to lack of money he will not be able to raise himself up, but he will do everything possible to raise himself up again. He is a very hard-working family man, for which reason he is very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the support they give him, and he hopes not to end up looking badly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1105850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

The business is called El Patr\u00f3n.\r\n\r\nThis time she has requested a loan to buy soft drinks, milk, soap, and canned goods, etc.  She tells us that she does have difficulty, the nearby competition.

In this beautiful area,  Yohenis has her own business selling a variety of goods such as footwear, cosmetics and perfumes.  She decided to start her business when she arrived in this city from Barranquilla (a city two hours from Cartagena) five years ago together with her family (her husband and her two children who are now 6 and 4 years old).  Yohenis started off buying merchandise which she later sold retail.  She sold her products on credit to a small number of customers.  She gradually increased her customer base and also her opportunities for investment.  She started selling products through specialized guides and catalogs and still does this.  Yohenis' main products are cosmetics, clothing, and men's, women's and children's accessories.

El nombre del grupo se eligi\u00f3 ya que cuando las integrantes formaron el grupo, la representante de entonces ten\u00eda un grupo musical de ni\u00f1os llamado \"Rayito de Sol\".\nAhora quien es la representante del grupo es Do\u00f1a Guadalupe de 42 a\u00f1os de edad; ella est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Jes\u00fas desde hace 26 a\u00f1os quien tambi\u00e9n es comerciante. Juntos han formado una familia; sus hijos son: Omar quien se encuentra estudiando la universidad y una ni\u00f1a en primaria. Do\u00f1a Lupita, como mejor la conocen, nos cuenta que ella se dedica a vender productos de jarcer\u00eda desde hace 18 a\u00f1os; ella vende en el mercado casi todos los d\u00edas de la semana solo descansa los mi\u00e9rcoles, s\u00e1bados y domingos. Do\u00f1a Lupita inici\u00f3 esta actividad para ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar y tambi\u00e9n con los gastos de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Esta vez ha solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para comprar \u00fanicamente vasos de licuadora, pilas, estropajos, fibras y cosas de pl\u00e1sticos. Comenta que el cr\u00e9dito le ayuda de mucho ya que as\u00ed ella puede surtirse en lo que m\u00e1s necesita y as\u00ed no preocuparse un buen rato por su mercanc\u00eda. Sin embargo, Do\u00f1a Lupita tambi\u00e9n explica que presenta dificultades como el no tener un lugar bien establecido para vender ya que por ahora, para vender tranquilamente tiene que buscar y pagar un lugar estable a los delegados del mercado. Por lo general todas las integrantes del grupo tienen esta dificultad y no lo pagan porque es muy caro. En temporadas de lluvia tampoco pueden vender durante mucho tiempo y es la temporada en la que les va un poco mal en sus ventas. Una de las metas que se ha propuesto es que su hijo termine su licenciatura de contadur\u00eda para que su calidad de vida mejore ya que si est\u00e1 dentro de sus posibilidades el ayudarlo, lo har\u00e1, aunque tenga que esforzarse m\u00e1s. Do\u00f1a Lupita menciona que sus ganancias son de gran ayuda ya que cuando no tiene buenas ventas, toma de los ahorros para cubrir otros gastos como la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, alimentaci\u00f3n, calzado y tambi\u00e9n para realizar sus pagos con la institituci\u00f3n.\n\nDo\u00f1a Lupita y las integrantes del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentas y agradecidas con Kiva y Vision Fund (FRAC) por el apoyo que les ofrece ya que cada una de ellas podr\u00e1 invertir en sus actividades. Carolina invertir\u00e1 en contrloes remoto para televisison, DVD, etc. Do\u00f1a Elvira surtir\u00e1 su tienda, Do\u00f1a Eufemia invert\u00eda en calcetas, Do\u00f1a Juana invertir\u00e1 en batas y mandiles, Do\u00f1a Paula y Elena invertir\u00e1n en vasos de licuadora y jarcer\u00eda mientras que Josefina invertir\u00e1 en chales y rebosos y Do\u00f1a Florentina invertir\u00e1 en su tienda de abarrotes.\n\n","en":"The \u201cEl Rayito de Sol\u201d (Little Ray of Sunshine) group is composed of nine responsible, hardworking women who strive to move their families forward.  These women live in a community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec where the people in addition to growing corn also work in commerce in a small, very tranquil setting.  The name of the group was chosen when the members formed the group.  The representative back then had a children\u2019s musical group called \u201cRayito de Sol.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe group representative now is Guadalupe, 42.  She\u2019s been married to Jes\u00fas who is also a merchant for 26 years.  They have formed a family together.  Their children are Omar who is attending university and a daughter in elementary school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita, as she\u2019s better known, tells us that she\u2019s been selling janitorial supplies for 18 years.  She sells in the market almost every day of the week; she only takes off Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Do\u00f1a Lupita started this business to help her husband with household expenses and also to help cover her children\u2019s educational costs.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy blender jars, batteries, scouring pads, fibers and plastic items.  She comments that the loan will help her much because she will be able to stock up on what she needs the most and not have to worry about merchandise for a while.  However, Do\u00f1a \r\nLupita also explains that she does have the difficulty caused by not having a well-established place in which to sell because for now, in order to sell in peace, she has to find a space and pay the market delegates for it.  In general, not all the members of the group have this problem and they don\u2019t pay it because it\u2019s very expensive.\r\n\r\nWhen it rains they can\u2019t sell either and sometimes that\u2019s for long periods of time and she does poorly with her sales then.  One of the goals she\u2019s set is that her son finishes his bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting so that his quality of life can improve and if it\u2019s within the realm of her possibility to help him, she\u2019ll do so even if it means striving harder.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita mentions that her profits are of great help to her because when sales are poor she draws from savings to cover other expenses like her children\u2019s schooling, food, shoes and also to make her payments to the institution.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Lupita and the group members are very happy and grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC) for the support they give because each one of them will be able to invest in her activities.  Carolina will invest in remote controls for television sets, DVD\u2019s, etc., Do\u00f1a Elvira will stock her store, Do\u00f1a Eufemia will buy socks, Do\u00f1a Juana will buy robes and aprons, Do\u00f1a Paula and Elena will buy blender jars and janitorial supplies while Josefina will invest in shawls and \u2018rebozos\u2019 [Mexican shawls] and Do\u00f1a Florentina will invest in her grocery store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":1105832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy spoons, plates, blender jars, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-04T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-04T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.63},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":415.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1246.88,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17358.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419085,"comment":null},{"amount":831.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11572.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568661,"comment":null},{"amount":1246.87,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":17358.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399951,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T05:26:10Z","paid_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432458,"name":"Mu'ssha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Venancio tiene 70 a\u00f1os de edad y es originario de una poblaci\u00f3n pintoresca y con una gran cultura como la mazahua, \u00e9l es parte del grupo llamado Mu\u00b4ssha dice que eligieron el nombre porque antes invert\u00edan en borregos y es lo que significa esa palabra en lengua mazahua. \u00c9l es carpintero desde hace mas de 20 a\u00f1os, dice que por falta de un trabajo estable un amigo le ense\u00f1o a como trabajar la madera para que tuviera un trabajo m\u00e1s seguro, el platica que hace mesas, sillas, bancos, puertas, ventanas de madera y muchas otras cosas m\u00e1s.

Since 1984 when she arrived in Cartagena, she\u2019s been selling products from the sea to support her home.  Later a merchant gave her the opportunity of selling clothes that he sold and she did very well.  She started earning two incomes and when she had a solid customer base and a little capital she became independent.  Her greatest strength in her business development is her independent spirit because since she was a girl she\u2019d show this to her parents and this is reflected in the joy she gets from commercial activities that she\u2019s engaged in selling many products.\r\n\r\nFour years ago she consolidated into selling fish and she organized her infrastructure with cases that she buys stocked with assorted river fish from the market in the city and then sells among her customers taking advantage of the good prices her suppliers give her which allows her to generate profits to reinvest again like she\u2019s done previously when she added a new business with a stand where she sells candy and natural fruit from each harvest, activities with which she\u2019s effectively complemented her

She is single and the mother of two children who are 20 and 15 years old.  She lives with her children in her own home which is located in Chanchamayo district.\r\n\r\nGladys is a woman who has learned to work in a number of business activities.  When she separated from her children's father, she had to take charge of protecting and providing for them herself.  She has been providing a meal service for four years now.  She carries out this work twice a month and prepares her meals in the oven and on the grill.  She uses trout, chicken, lamb, beef and pork.\r\n\r\nGladys' sales method is unusual.  She makes cards or tickets which she sells days before delivering her meals.  \"An accepted card is a paid-for card\" is her motto.  Every fortnight she offers 50 dishes and sells each one for 7 soles.  \"At these events I also sell soda, beer and candies because it is profitable\" she says.  Gladys enjoys cooking and enjoys making a living from what she knows how to do.  For this reason, she would like to open a stable stall outside the state hospital.

He uses a carbon oven in his kitchen and every day sells fried food. He is located in a commercial area of the city where little by little he has gained clients trust and affection. With this business Javier is able to sustain his family and he has high expectations for growing this business since he works hard every day. His wife started this business while he distributed bread to various stores but sales were so low that they decided to divide their efforts. This way his wife could raise their children and he was in charge of the business and helping it grow little by little. Today his main clients are employees from local companies, neighbors, passer-byers making it a highly trafficked place. However he wants to take more opportunities. His investment plan consists of diversifying his merchandise, adding more products requested by clients such as chicken, grilled beef, pork rinds, etc and change his carbon oven to a gas oven. This will improve his working conditions and amplify his product selection according to client\u2019s demand. This is why he is requesting Kiva a loan and start his project. He believes he can succeed due to the highly trafficked area, his strength in his performance, and work discipline.

v\u00edveres, ranchos, licores, carnes y abarrotes, a sus 18 a\u00f1os, posee una gran experiencia y capacidad de trabajo inigualables, sus clientela la conforman sus vecinos, peatones que transitan  permanentemente por el sitio donde se encuentra ubicado su negocio. En su barrio ubicado al sur de la ciudad, donde vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hija de 9 meses de nacida,  es muy reconocida por el buen trato que ofrece a sus clientes a quienes trata con mucho respeto. Poco a poco su clientela se incrementa y con ello la demanda de sus productos, los cuales vende al detalle y diariamente rotan con gran rapidez, por eso aunque la competencia es alta se sostiene en el mercado porque adem\u00e1s ofrece precios muy competitivos. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener siempre lo que el cliente necesita, pues son bienes de la canasta familiar que no dan espera y que las familias los consumen diariamente. As\u00ed su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente para sostener un stock de mercanc\u00edas y responder oportunamente la demanda. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el  cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor cantidad y de contado v\u00edveres, abarrotes, licores, con los cuales ganar\u00e1 descuentos por el volumen y con ello potencializa el aumento de sus ventas y ganara tambi\u00e9n,  el aumento permanente de los precios que es una constante en su negocio, haciendo que su inversi\u00f3n credikiva sea muy exitosa.  ","en":"From 6 a.m. until 10 pm. Monday through Sunday, Marta is attending her business of a general store where she sells supplies, snacks, liquor, meat, and groceries.  At her 18 years of age, she has unequaled experience and working ability.  Her customers are her neighbors and pedestrians who pass by the location of her business.  Her neighborhood is in the south of the city, where she lives with her husband and her 9-month-old daughter.  She is very well-known for the good service she offers her customers, whom she treats with a lot of respect.  Little by little, her clientele is increasing, and with it, so is the demand for her products, which she sells retail and turns over quickly.  Even though her competition is strong, she sustains herself in the market because she offers very competitive prices.  Her biggest challenge is always having what her customers need, which are basic goods that they can't wait for since the families consume them daily.  This is why her working capital has become insufficient to maintain a stock of merchandise and respond appropriately to the demand.  So, she has applied for a Kiva loan, the first financing that she has had with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy supplies, groceries, and liquor in larger quantities so she can receive discounts.  She will then be able to increase her sales and profits.  Ever-rising prices are constant in her industry, so investing her Kiva loan will be very successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1107761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She started more than 6 years ao, and now she has her son's support in attending to the customers during his free time.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be rather profitable due to the demand for her products.  She likes what she does because she gets to attend to her customers, which means socializing with her neighbors and exchanging ideas.  The economic income also helps her support her husband with their home's expenses, since many times the income that he makes doesn't cover everything, and they have had difficulties paying for all of their expenses and their children's educational costs.

She is an enterprising and dynamic woman, as well as being friendly and happy. She is single, and lives with her parents and three siblings.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe works selling drinks from her home, and has a refrigerator to do so. She started this business two years ago with her own capital, which she obtained from her savings, buying small quantities of drinks and selling coal with her father. She thinks that her business is fairly profitable because of the demand for the drinks in the hot area where she lives, and she makes a good profit. Thanks to this she wants to continue with her business, extending it so that she can have a soda distribution business in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is Musy\u2019s second loan with the MFP institution. She is grateful for the financial support given, which helps her progress with her business. She is therefore committed to being punctual with her loan repayments, so that she has a good credit history. She also feels good about her communal bank, as she knows the members and thinks they are good people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 1,000 nuevos soles, Musy plans to buy more sodas at wholesale prices. She also wants to buy more coal to sell in her father\u2019s stall in the market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1108438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy drinks and

She tells us that right now her biggest problem is crime and the wireless connection, which despite everything is very low. With the loan she hopes to buy more computers to grow her business with which she will increase her income and fix up her

She sells clothing and shoes for women, men, and children.  She began her business 2 years ago and sent money to relatives in Lima so that they could purchase and send her merchandise.\r\n\r\nNow she travels herself to Lima so that she can personally choose the best styles of clothing.  She accepts cash and sometimes credit, but it must be paid within 15 days.  She likes her work and the fact that it allows her to have free time to do other activities.  However, she does not like when her customers don't comply with the payment agreement, but despite of this, she has plans to open a clothing store in a commercial area of the city.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan from MFP and she hopes to use it to continue working toward her goals.  She promises to comply with the payment schedule like she did with the last loan that she had.  She is also happy to be a part of the community bank because all of the people there are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1000 soles, she will invest in the purchase of various clothes and women's shoes, and she will search for volume discounts for her purchases."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1108444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":149.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":158.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":172.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":175.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":185.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":149.58,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":151.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098990,"comment":null},{"amount":59.6,"local_amount":158.92,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":161.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401850,"comment":null},{"amount":59.32,"local_amount":158.18,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":160.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456131,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":172.22,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":174.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451786,"comment":null},{"amount":65.84,"local_amount":175.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":178.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446970,"comment":null},{"amount":69.57,"local_amount":185.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":188.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052877,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She visits the houses of her neighbors and friends, and also offers her products in her neighborhood\u2019s market.  She can tend to almost 20 customers during the day; her business is growing because she is very friendly with customers and enjoys her work.\r\n\r\nDiana is very thankful for the Kiva loans since, thanks to the help they provide, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business such as jackets, sweaters, and track suits, among other items.  This will allow her to have more products to offer and give her customers a greater variety of goods to choose from.  It will help improve her income and allow her to continue working every day with the enthusiasm that characterizes her to make her greatest dream a reality: \u201cTo provide a good education for my children, and to continue growing each day\u201d.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1108540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy merchandise (jackets, sweaters and track suits, among other items).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tingui\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T12:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonny Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":149.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":157.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":162.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":169.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":177},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":183.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.53},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.18,"local_amount":149.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":151.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222531,"comment":null},{"amount":58.96,"local_amount":157.23,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":159.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298606,"comment":null},{"amount":60.99,"local_amount":162.63,"processed_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":164.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351335,"comment":null},{"amount":63.53,"local_amount":169.43,"processed_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":171.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108974,"comment":null},{"amount":66.38,"local_amount":177,"processed_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":179.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345156,"comment":null},{"amount":68.96,"local_amount":183.9,"processed_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":186.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T10:43:59Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:40:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433820,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of five children, Loreta works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a vegetable vending business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from fish vending.

The quality of life of the residents of this area is humble, and many do not have even basic public utility services.\r\n\r\nFor the past year, she has dedicated herself to preparing and selling food, especially fried chicken and homemade desserts.  She makes the food in her home, and sells them right there to neighbors and acquaintances, also occasionally selling from her in-law\u2019s house.

The inhabitants of the area are mainly farmers and livestock breeders: this is a very hard-working community, and their standard of living is very poor, electricity being the only commodity.\r\n\r\nCintia has been engaged in breeding and selling small animals, such as sheep, turkeys and chickens for many years. Cintia raised her animals at home, in especially fit out pens, and she feeds them with balanced animal feed, grains and natural fodder; once they have reached a good size she sells them to shopkeepers and to neighbors of her area.

You can also find the Nazca Lines in the city (huge drawings in the middle of an arid field that served as a calendar of the rains for the Nazca culture centuries ago), which receives a lot of tourists all year.  Agriculture is developed in Nazca, especially the cultivation of cactus pear, cotton, and corn, among others.\r\n\r\nWhen Nazario has free time he really likes to read.

He works on his parcel of land around ten hours a day.

Several places with precarious and humble living conditions are concentrated in this district.  Most of them do not have all of the basic services.  In Blanca\u2019s case, her house only has electricity.\r\n\r\nShe currently raises and sells sheep.  She has a flock of sheep at her house, and she is raising them and feeding them natural grasses.  When the sheep reach an adequate weight, she sells them to her neighbors, to businessmen in the area, or at the local market.\r\n\r\nThe income that she gets from this business activity will allow her to help her husband with the financial support of her family.  Her husband is responsible for a parcel of land where he cultivates mango and staples products.\r\n\r\nBlanca wishes to get balanced feed for her sheep.  She wants them to develop in a better way, and she wants to be able to get improved income from her sales.

partner, she went back to her work in retail trade to generate income and be able to contribute to the expenses of the household, such as the educational expenses and other basic needs for her nuclear family.\r\n\r\nShe sells products through a catalog (lingerie and cosmetics), and she collects according to the school schedule of her youngest daughter.  She makes her sales and collects when her daughter is in school, some days in the mornings and others in the afternoons.  \r\n\r\nMartha lives in a lower middle-class residential neighborhood located in Cartago province. She sells her products in neighborhoods close to her place of residence.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Martha has requested a loan, and she is doing it through the Fundacion on the recommendation of a good friend of hers who has been our client.  As head of household, Martha has had to confront obstacles, such as not having much time for her business because she must care for her daughters.

At first they worked for other people but as time has gone by they have been able to acquire their own land and in this way she has been able to become independent together with her husband and their 6 children. They have been successful thanks to their dedication to the work, since they have an annual production of 15 tonnes, which generates sufficient income to be able to live modestly but without needs.\r\n\r\nSometimes they produce plants which they sell to other producers, but this year they have decided to buy. During the harvest Maria and her family hire day labourers to work with them, because it would be impossible for them to complete all the work the coffee requires alone. In this way they help other families financially. \r\n\r\nAlthough they have a very good production, she would like to increase it, since this would mean a larger income. To do this she needs to sow new seeds and to do clearing work in her land. For this reason they need a loan. \r\n\r\nIn addition to production, Maria is in charge of receiving all of the coffee produced in her area, which is sent in its entirety to \u201cUnion Regional de Huatusco\u201d an institution which processes and exports the coffee. \r\n\r\nFor Maria it has been very satisfying to be able to give her children what they need to succeed on their own.

All are from the city of Chill\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, communal bank President, appears in the photo standing in the first row, second from left to right, wearing a black shirt and gray vest; her hair is dark brown and she wears it loose.\r\n\r\nShe sews, embroiders and makes clothes specifically sweatshirts and t-shirts.  She\u2019s been in this business for a year and works every day.  She manages her time according to availability because her daughter is little.\r\n\r\nThe merchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago because it\u2019s a place where she can find merchandise at low cost so it\u2019s convenient economically.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy all types of thread, fabric, buttons and zippers to stock her sewing workshop.  Her business goals are to have the opportunity to have an independent locale and to add industrial machines like embroiderers to offer better quality in the sewing and dressmaking work to her customers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth lives with her 8-year-old daughter who is studying and one of her dreams is to give economic stability to her daughter so that in the future she can attend the university.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza is giving her because it\u2019s allowed her to invest in her business.  Also, she feels very comfortable in the company of the other entrepreneurs in the communal bank because they share different activities.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in the south-central part of Chile.  Its name means \u201cSeat of the Sun\u201d in Mapudungun, the language of our indigenous Mapuches.  Chill\u00e1n is known as the \u201cCradle of the Fatherland\u201d or \u201cLand of Artists\u201d because many outstanding figures in Chilean history were born in this city like, for example, the well-known pianist, Claudio Arrau.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":1108961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Chill\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T18:10:07Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelsin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelsin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marjorie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2109219,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141540},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":142888},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144250},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":145625},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":147014},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":148420},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":149835},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":151265},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":152711},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154170},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":155644},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157118},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158621},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.85},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1969.81,"local_amount":1019572,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1024496.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430190,"comment":null},{"amount":1185.84,"local_amount":613790,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":616754.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332964,"comment":null},{"amount":919.35,"local_amount":475857,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":478155.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301878985,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-09T05:26:10Z","paid_date":"2012-09-18T08:22:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":432998,"name":"Jes\u00fas Vive Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9  Jes\u00fas Vive se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed.

She sells fruits and vegetables as well as spit-roasted meat and general articles. She has been doing so for 10 years. She works Monday to Sunday from 8:30 to 10:30; her business operates in her own home. She buys her products from fruit and vegetable distributors, in supermarkets and from general articles distributors, since those sell them at a lower price, which means it is the best thing to do from an economic standpoint. With the loan she will buy fruits, vegetables and general articles such as hairgrips, toys, hair accessories and other accessories. One of her goals is to be able to restore her retail space, to have more to offer and to repaint the walls, buy new doors, redo the floor and lighting. Carla lives with her two children, aged 9 and 6. Her personal goals are to be more at ease with her business and to manage the profits well in order to have a better quality of life with her children. She is very happy and grateful for the opportunity afforded to her by field partner Fondo Esperanza, since it allowed her to invest in her business. She also feels very comfortable in the company of the other women entrepreneurs in her communal bank group, since they share various activities and interests, and the group provides a welcome distraction from everyday life. Thanks to the training imparted in group meetings, Carla learned to better manage her business. Talca belongs to the Maule region, located in the central part of the country. It is the administrative, economic and cultural centre of the region: it is the most important city of the Chilean central valley. A curious fact about Talca is the existence of a somewhat obscure phrase in Chile: \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\" (\"Talca, Paris, and London\"). Several explanations of varying degrees of plausibility circulate about its origins. Some say that it derives from a comment uttered by an Englishman: \"Talca parece Londres\" (which, in Spanish, sounds almost identical to \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres\", and means \"Talca resembles London\"). Indeed, in the winter, an abundant fog often blankets the city, as happens in the capital of the United Kingdom."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1109042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy fruits,

She lives with her husband Jaime, who is a petrol station attendant in the city. Her 4 children are adults and married. Victoria started to sell products through catalogues at a young age, since she has always liked retail. She also did it in order to have enough income to meet her expenses. Nowadays, she has a small shop where she sells products such as sweets, snacks, yoghourt, etc. She minds the shop Monday to Saturday and one of her daughters accompanies her when she has to buy supplies. She likes her work because it keeps her active and provides a distraction. Victoria tells us that they have not had any problems with criminal activity but that she does face other challenges such as health problems, since she had an incipient bronchitis a while ago. It was a very worrisome episode and she was convalescent for a while: she has now recovered and hopes that it will not happen again. Her dream is to travel to know other places; she also hopes to restore her house and improve her quality of life.

Another of the advantages of organic coffee is that you don't use chemical fertilizers, so it helps conserve the land. This process will take them approximately three years, and is why they need a loan.\r\n\r\nThey would also like to be able to buy a piece of land to enable them to plant more coffee seedlings and so increase their production.

located behind a market called \u201cLa Palma.\u201d  It\u2019s a group whose members come from different places and meets in a house that\u2019s still not completely finished but that\u2019s where they have their meetings.  When we asked the group why it was called La Huerta, they answered laughing: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have an orchard anymore but we used to meet in a huge orchard where there was lots of fruit like apples, pears, figs, lemons, etc.  But now look where we are.\u201d  The members of the group are very grateful and happy with VisionFund (FRAC) and with Kiva because they will be able to invest in their activities.  For example:  Do\u00f1a Reyna will buy bedspreads and blankets, Do\u00f1a Silvia and Alma Jazm\u00edn will buy crafts, Jos\u00e9 will buy jewelry, \u00c1ngela will invest in painting napkins and finally, Don Leonardo will buy belts but also will invest in his sheep.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Petra who also belongs to the group tells us that she\u2019s 46-years-old and a widow with two dependents still, a girl and  boy; the girl is still attending secondary school and the boy is no longer in school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Petra tells us that she works making crafts like sashes and napkins.  Petra learned how to make these crafts from her mother.  She tells us that in order to make the sashes she needs yarn.  She buys the entire skein and then unravels the individual threads and then embroiders again so that the sash will end up embroidered; in addition to the sashes she also does napkins.\r\n\r\nPetra tells us that the only difficulty she has is being able to buy her supplies sometimes which is why she\u2019s asking for this loan to buy yarn and embroidery fabric.  The loan will be very beneficial because she will be able to stock up for a good period of time.  Petra says that what she likes best is to make them so her customers will be satisfied with what she does.  Petra always sells outside the gates but would like it if her business grew gradually so as not to need to come all the way to San Felipe to sell any longer.\r\n\r\nPetra is very grateful for the loan because her profits will be of much use to her to cover household expenses and her children\u2019s schooling.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1107597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy embroidery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Jazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonardo Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":356.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287419095,"comment":null},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568671,"comment":null},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399961,"comment":null},{"amount":712.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10284.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407626,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-14T05:21:59Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433962,"name":"Phalla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phalla (pictured here) has full-time employment, while her husband, San is a motor taxi driver.

The artisanal crafts that are most common from this area include toys and other items from wood, machetes, hammocks (made from wool and cotton), brightly painted wooden masks that represent different animals and blouses embroidered with beads.  \r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Macedonia, better known as Marce. She is 38 years old and is known for being a friendly, hard working and humble woman. She sells tamales (a traditional food made with corn dough, filled with meat and sauce and wrapped in a plantain leaf or corn husk), chicharrones (fried pig skin) and popsicles, which she has been doing for the past 10 years. She told us that she is a single mother and she has 5 children: Araceli, Eduardo, Damaris, Yessenia and Beltsy. Only Damaris and Eduardo are supported by her; her other children live with her but are already married. Marce is very happy because her children help her with her business. The thing she likes best is making tamales, and going out in the streets of her community to sell. She said that since she was young she has enjoyed selling things, managing her time and her money, but that now it is different because she is working to be able to give a better life to her children and above all to give them a better education.

He is married and the father of five children. He started his business with his personal savings and has made it profitable, in part because he is in a good location with many residents who are attracted by low-cost housing. The main challenges he faces are fluctuating prices and the high cost of materials. He would like to increase the capacity of his cafe because that would maximize his income. He was introduced to Yehu by his friends and is applying for a loan for 15,000 Kenyan shillings to buy food stock of maize flour, wheat flour, rice and sugar. His ambition is to turn his caf\u00e9 into a world class hotel in the near future, and he believes that the additional income made possible by this loan will help him improve his family\u2019s living standards.

Martha is a single mother, in spite of the adversities that have come up in her life she has been able to get through, together with her daughter. She has always been a fighter and a hard working woman. In her spare time she likes to knit wool sweaters for her daughter and some family members, and in some occasions she prepares a delicious \"caucau\", her and her daughter's favorite dish. With a lot of hard work she finished her secondary education. Unfortunately, due to lack of financial resources she wasn't able to go to the university, but she would have liked a lot to study Accounting. Thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit and the support of her sisters, over a year ago, Martha set up her business selling broaster chicken and selling clothes. She dedicates about 13 hours a day to her business, which allows her to service up to 35 customers. She believes her business is doing well, thanks to her cooking skills and talent for sales, as well as her kind disposition and good customer service. Martha is very thankful to Kiva lenders since thanks to the help provided by them she will be able to purchase merchandise such as: polo shirts, sweaters, pants and blouses among others. In this way she will be able to supply her clothes selling business and increase her financial income, which she hopes, further on in the future, will allow her to buy a sandwich cart she will use to

She has 2 children: the oldest is 11 years old and the little one is 2 years old.  She is very happy to have her two little ones, because they are her joy, and what she most desires is to get them ahead.  In her spare time, she enjoys watching TV with her children, and at times she prepares one of their favorite dishes, such as \"Arroz con Pato\" (rice with duck).  With a lot of effort, Yenny completed her high school education.  But unfortunately, even though she really wanted to, she was unable to study graphic design because of a lack of financial resources.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, and with a lot of enthusiasm, Yenny started up her business selling food.  In addition, she provides photographic services.  She works in her business about 10 hours a day, and she believes that her business is going well thanks to her good cooking, her charm, and the good service she provides to her customers.\r\n\r\nYenny is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help they are providing she will be able to recondition her tri-cycle vehicle, which she uses to sell her food in the center of the city.  In this way, Yenny hopes to be able to increase her income so that she can set up her business in the center of the city and thereby, in the near future, establish her own photographic studio.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1109099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"to recondition her tri-cycle catering vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nazca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-06-05T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-05T20:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yenny Yessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":94.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":97.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":106.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":110.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":89.89,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222536,"comment":null},{"amount":35.38,"local_amount":94.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":95.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298612,"comment":null},{"amount":36.59,"local_amount":97.58,"processed_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":98.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301351340,"comment":null},{"amount":38.13,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108978,"comment":null},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":106.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345161,"comment":null},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":110.31,"processed_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":111.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954376,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-05T21:16:21Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":433991,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is married with three children; only two of her children go to school.

She\u2019s been in these lines of work for two years.\r\n\r\nMerchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago and sometimes her relatives ship her clothes for her to sell in her business which helps her save.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy different styles of clothes for all ages.  She will also buy fabric and thread to make curtains.  Her business goal is to set up a workshop to sell her supplies to her clientele.\r\n\r\nPamela lives alone with her four children who are 19, 13, 10 and 2 years of age and one of her dreams is to become independent with her workshop to generate higher income and with it be able to opt for a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nPamela is very happy and grateful for the loan and the services provided by Fondo Esperanza and she also feels very comfortable with the meetings and with her communal bank group because generosity and unity prevail.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in the south-central part of Chile.  Its name means \u201cSeat of the Sun\u201d in Mapudungun, the language of our indigenous Mapuches.  Chill\u00e1n is known as the \u201cCradle of the Fatherland\u201d or \u201cLand of Artists\u201d because many outstanding figures in Chilean history were born in this city like, for example, the well-known pianist, Claudio Arrau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6400,"image":{"id":1108975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In his free time he enjoys playing soccer with his friends and neighbors, and sometimes he cooks one of his favorite dishes, such as the delicious \"arroz con pollo\" (rice with chicken).

Unfortunately, due to lack of resources, he couldn't go to college, but he would have liked to have studied for a career in law.\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of drive to get ahead, Daniel runs a small grocery shop from his home, where he works every morning. In addition, he goes out on foot every afternoon selling popcorn, beans, toasted corn and other things. He works on his business about 12 hours a day, and during this time he serves a good amount of customers.

She earns a minimum of Php 550 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan.
