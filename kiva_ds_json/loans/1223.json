With income from his milk trade, Mishach has managed to look after his family, including his parents, by providing them with medication, paying school fees for his children, and constructing a permanent house for the family.\r\n\r\nMishach is applying for a loan of 3,000,000 UGX to buy more milk cows to increase his milk production.

Kiromiddin previously worked as a tractor driver and is knowledgeable about working the land; his many years of experience will help him in this undertaking. \n\nWith these intentions, Kiromiddin applied for a loan with MDO Humo. The loan will be used to buy wheat and potatos.

49-year-old Yamarie from Moriba town in Sierra Leone. She is married with 5 children between the ages of 10 years and 27 years old. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2008, Yamarie established her wood business. She began her business because she needed to establish a source of income to support her home. She works at the business 10 hours per day, 7 days per week. She says that her business is doing well, because she is able to earn enough for her daily meal from the profit. Yamarie requires a loan in order to purchase wood for resale. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and pay her children's school fees. In the future, Eleanor plans to open a grocery shop. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.25,"image":{"id":1435468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She is very excited to be receiving her fifth loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off her previous loans. She has had her business for around 28 years. Her business consists of selling auto parts and supplies. With this next loan she plans to buy more brake fluid, which is very much needed by the many taxis in Brazzaville. One of her strategies in her business has been selling in bulk to owners of multiple taxis. With these regular customers, there is less risk of having a bad month of sales. With future profits Ernestine hopes to further diversify her inventory as well as construct a new home for her family.

The group consists of eight micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Marcelin is married with four children, ages ranging from 3 months to 27 years old. He is very excited to be receiving his second loan from HOPE Congo after having successfully paid off his previous loan. He has had his business for around seven years. His business is a general store, selling many different items including beverages and medical supplies. With this next loan he will concentrate on buying large cases of mineral water and milk.

In starting this business, he will be helped by a relative who is engaged in this sphere.

Years later, upon getting engaged, she started to work independently and rapidly acquired her first piece of land in order to earn income producing and selling organic cacao. It was in this way, at the side of her husband, that she started to plan many long-term goals. After the death of her husband, she found it necessary to assume a double maternal role.\r\n\r\nHer main work consists in maintaining in optimal condition the cacao crops she has on the 2 hectares of farmland that she owns. She usually hires workers who help her with the tasks of weeding, harvest, and applying organic fertilizer. She likes her work very much, since it is work she has done all her life. Nevertheless, on many occasions the climate and other natural factors make her productive work difficult. This is her first loan with Kiva, and she hopes to have the confidence necessary to move forward. She also promises to move forward. At this time, she wants to have 2,000 nuevos soles to buy organic fertilizer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.95,"image":{"id":1440837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":219.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":233.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":228.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":248.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":257.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":258.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":274.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":280.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.48,"local_amount":219.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":219.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353902,"comment":null},{"amount":84.7,"local_amount":233.65,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":234.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905689,"comment":null},{"amount":82.77,"local_amount":228.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-23T09:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":228.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091673,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T19:44:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610309,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of three children, Jocelyn works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a fish-vending business in the Philippines and earns additional income from fruit and vegetable vending.

is Susan, 52, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. She is a widow and has five children. She and her children manage their household while operating a variety store business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nSusan dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes that her children will always be in good health.

At first she had the solid support of her husband but after their separation she started to work independently.  She now works with the help of her parents. \r\n\r\nNidy is knowledgeable about various agricultural activities like the production and maintenance of organic cocoa, which is one of the products her family has traditionally grown. Being a very proactive person she has managed along with her parents to have a very good growing season, using day labor to carry out the various tasks. She has pushed the using of organic fertilizer like guano to obtain a higher quality harvest. \r\n\r\nWith the passing of the years Nidy has come to think it convenient to purchase a small plot of land and start the production of cocoa of her own. She hopes to improve her economic situation and she comments that she hopes to be able to offer her children a good education so they can be better people. One of her long term goals is to own a considerable amount of agricultural land and with that generate more revenues.\r\n\r\nThis is Nidy's first loan with Kiva and in spite of her young age she is known in her community as a very responsible person. At this time she is requesting 3000 PEN and together with her savings she will buy a plot of land where she can begin her own organic cocoa plantation.

He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to over 100 families in his community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia.  Most rural families in Kabwe District grow maize on their small farms and store it to use as their primary supply of food for the year.  After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima.  Edson is already a well-respected maize and dairy farmer in his community and wants to expand his business to offer the maize milling service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in Edson\u2019s community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal.  The closest maize mill is 20km away, but is often broken down.  This means most potential customers have to travel more than 30km to a nearby town, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers such as Edson, as it allows for him to diversify his business.  Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive.  Once he secures a loan, Edson will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. \n\nThis loan will help Edson on the path to building up a viable business that can provide for his family and community throughout the year.  It is for this reason Edson is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a maize mill as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":524.62,"image":{"id":1441008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to obtain a maize milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T17:20:09Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":13200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5810}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":378.79,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616078,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":772.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841797,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T02:35:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610324,"name":"Elisapeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisapeta is a 59-year-old widow with 5 children.

She hopes to get very good results because of her ample experience with prepared foods and because she can count on the help of her two daughters.  Mar\u00eda's dream is to make her business a profitable source of income that will allow her to have the financial stability she needs to keep ensuring her children's wellbeing and to offer them a better quality of life.

Su labor principal consiste en brindarle le mejor de los cuidados posibles a sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9 que tiene alrededor de sus terrenos ya que a diferencia de otros productos rentables de su zona requiere los respectivos cuidados para lograr una buena calidad comercial en la cosecha. Es por ello que fertiliza sus suelos solo con abono org\u00e1nico. Considera que la labor mas complicada es la cosecha de los granos cafeteros ya que es un trabajo que realiza contratando trabajadores para su posterior pelado y secado al aire libre. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con Kiva y espera contar con la confianza necesaria para invertir en sus parcelas.

She is married to Justiniano and has four children who live with her in her home. She has been cultivating the land for over twenty years with her husband's steady support thanks to a small plot of land she inherited from her parents and that served her to obtain her first earnings and acquire the five acres of land she currently has. She says she was very afraid when she first started because she didn't have enough money to buy supplies like organic fertilizer, let alone to hire workers, so she had to work very hard alongside her husband, even though she had to carry her first child in her arms. \r\n\r\nThe main focus of her work is tending to the coffee crops she has surrounding her land as best as possible, because unlike other profitable products in her area, coffee requires specific care in order to achieve good commercial quality at harvest. That is why she only fertilizes her land with organic products. She considers picking the coffee beans to be the most complicated part of the process, since she has to hire workers to later peel and air-dry the beans. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Kiva and she hopes to have the trust she needs to invest in her land. This time she wants to have 3,000 nuevos soles to purchase organic fertilizer for her coffee crops.

She works in her shop everyday in order to make an honest daily living.\r\n\r\nGabriela is an entrepreneurial and innovative woman, who is always looking for the best for her family.  They live in a house in the rural area.  For the past few weeks, it has needed some repairs for the sake of comfort.  She would like to fix the roof in the bedroom because it leaks a lot during the rainy season.  She also wants to cement the patio so that the dirt doesn't turn to mud.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes to begin the work as soon as possible, but due to scarce resources, she cannot cover the cost of the materials.  This is why she is applying to FUSAI for a loan that will allow her to buy cement, sand, gravel, galvanized sheets and wood.  Gabriela is very happy with the assistance and hopes to make her payments on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1440816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy cement, sand, gravel, galvanized sheets and wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2014-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2014-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2015-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419770095,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T01:23:47Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T10:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610336,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet works hard to support her family.

While he works, his wife, Mukarram, cares for their son and daughter. At the moment, Abdugafor has too few jobs lined up, so he wants to do other work. His friend invited him to work as a videographer at weddings and various other events. Abdugafor knows how to use a camera, but he does not have a video camera. Therefore, he is asking for a loan to purchase a camera. With the camera, he will be able to get an interesting and lucrative job. We hope that he will succeed because he is always trying to do what is best for his family.\r\n

Many people like to chew betel leaf, so a few years ago he decided to open a betel leaf shop, to offer various kinds of betel leaf products to the people. He offers betel leaf in several kinds of mixtures -- for example, 'sweet paan,' (which consists of betel leaf mixed with chopped or coarsely ground areca nuts, mint, coconut, fruit preserves, 'gulkand,' or rose petal preserves, and various spices) and 'tobacco paan' (which consists of powdered betel leaf mixed with tobacco).\r\n \r\nHe is an expert in preparing 'paan,' because he has been running this shop for many years, and a lot of customers like to chew betel leaf products that have been prepared by him. In addition to betel leaf products, he offers cigarettes of different brands.\r\n \r\nM. Nadeem is 36 years of age and the father of four children. He has only a single source of income to support his household. For the growth of his business, he wants to start offering cold drinks, soft drinks, and mineral water. His customers demand cold drinks also, which was part of his decision to offer drinks. But he does not have a refrigerator for the preservation and chilling of drinks, or savings.\r\n\r\nTherefore, M. Nadeem requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan. He will use the loan to buy a refrigerator and cold drinks to sell. In this way, he will succeed in winning the trust of his customers and getting more income at the same time.

This is the reason he has a lot of experience in his profession. \r\n\r\nMukhtar's husband sews leather and rexine shoes with a machine. Then he attaches the sole to the shoe by stitching it with his hands. In this way, he is getting income for his family. \r\n\r\nHis sewing machine is out of order and he wants to replace it with a new one, but he does not have sufficient funds to buy a new machine. Therefore, Mukhtar has requested a loan for her husband, so that he could buy a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nHer family has to do hard work to get income for a huge family. Her sons also participate in the monthly income. Mukhtar wants to marry off her daughter, this is why she wants to save most of the earnings. \r\n\r\nMukhtar is very thankful to Kiva and its field partner, BRAC Pakistan. Note: Mukhtar raises her hand in the picture. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":307.26,"image":{"id":1436021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a sewing machine, so her husband can sew shoes to sell.

is a 53-year old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\nHer husband is a chef by profession; he provides services for cooking food for marriage ceremonies, parties and funfair

He cooks delicious Pakistani food such as biryani, qorma, roast chicken & fish and in sweet dishes he prepares firni and kheer. He is a very famous chef in his town and most of the people like to purchase food for their ceremonies from him. With his chef services he provides crockery as well. \r\nDue to continuous usage most of the crockery has broken or is scratched. He wants to buy new crockery for his chef business. Due to his household expenses he does not have a sufficient amount to buy crockery. \r\nTherefore, Rubina requested for a loan from Kiva's field partner BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband would be able to buy new crockery.\r\nRubina is the mother of 5 children; his sons also work but do not financially cooperate with her. \r\nRubina is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan for this honorable favor.

a Persian refugee from Iran, came to the United States on January 25, 2012. After completing the Welfare for Work program, Mahideh was not able to secure a full-time job. However, her entrepreneurial spirit constantly drives her to seek business opportunities. \n\nEarly in 2013, she visited the Valley Indoor Swap Meet in Panaroma City, California. Immediately her business instinct told her that it is a good business location. She spent many weeks at the swap meet to study the market, and her analysis was right. It is a perfect place to start her Persian food store. She contacted the Valley Indoor Swap Meet\u2019s management; they liked her business proposal, and six months later she was able to secure a space in the swap meet.\n\nMahideh knew she had many hurdles to overcome, and her experience told her preparation is the key. She came to PACE Business Development Center seeking assistance. She needed a business start-up loan to purchase restaurant equipment, make tenant improvements, and supply working capital for her day-to-day operation.  \n\nMahideh has a strong and supportive family. Her husband will continue his regular job and help her on his off days. Her teenage son and daughter also committed to help out in the restaurant. Mahideh\u2019s goal is to have her husband, Bahram, work side by side with her again. Mahideh\u2019s original plan was to name her business \u201cDream\u201d, and she is realizing her \u201cdream\u201d through Tamli Kabob.

He is a modest, independent and bright 19-year-old who is in his second year at a state university in Dushanbe.  Every year, Chehron pays more than $2000 USD for his tuition; his mother helps him pay for his schooling, as in Tajikistan, it is customary for parents to fund their children's education.  Chehron's mother and sister both work as seamstresses, selling the dresses that they make in a store.  In this way, Chehron's mother is able to earn money and provide for the family.  He helps his mother as well whenever he has free time.  This year, Chehron is $1500 USD short of making his tuition payment; he is seeking a loan from Humo so he can continue his studies, and looks forward to your help.

Pedro went to school up until the sixth grade, because he did not have the economic resources to finish his schooling. Pedro has been a farmer since he was 12. He grows bananas, corn, pipian squash, and other crops. His day starts at four in the morning. He milks three cows, then takes them to the field. To do this, he walks 20 minutes to the place where he keeps them. In the afternoons, his son collects the cattle. The loan will be used to buy five calves to graze, in order to take advantage of the winter grazing, and he will buy three sacks of fertilizer to fertilize the banana plants. His dream is to have a cowshed with lots of cattle and also to have a four-ton truck to sell his goods at the markets, a place where they pay him a better price. With this income, he will help his children to finish their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1439652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy five calves for grazing and three sacks of fertilizer for his banana crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-27T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-27T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-27T20:15:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610421,"name":"Naseem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem is a 54-year-old married woman who is living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.\r\n \r\nShe requested a loan for her husband\u2019s fruit-selling business.

During his working life he has always been an independent shopkeeper.  Nine years ago he started a video game business that also sold merchandise, which produced very good results and led to him being recognized in the community.  This allowed him to open a second business two years ago that offers internet service, sells minutes and recharges cell phones, sells cell phone accessories, and provides repair services for cell phones.  He works every day from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and when he has a lot of work to do he hires someone to work with him.  He takes advantage of being located in a very commercial neighborhood, which is why he has gotten excellent results that have generated a lot of income for his family.  He is known for being a hardworking, organized, strong, and disciplined man who works painstakingly so his businesses will grow.  He is asking for this loan to help him invest in stock (cell phones, recharge cards, SIM cards, cell phone accessories).  This will allow him to increase his sales, as he will have a wider variety of products available and cell phones with modern technology, which will satisfy the needs and demands of his customers.  The result of this will be an increase in his profit margins and better viability.  Luis wants to keep working hard so his family will not face any financial hardships and so his children can get and excellent education and have a better quality of life.

Following the death of her husband, she alone raises her 6 children and tends to her farm.  She has a high school education, and the brunt of her income comes from raising livestock, having started 10 years ago with 12,000 somoni worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistent efforts, her farm currently has 1 dairy cow, 1 bull, and 1 calf.  Her monthly income is 8,000 somoni.  To further develop her farm, Mirzaim is seeking a loan in the amount of 120,000 somoni from Bai Tushum & Partners to buy more cows for her farm.  She plans to reinvest the additional income that the loan will allow her to buy even more livestock.\r\n\r\n     "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":556.07,"image":{"id":1441107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chat-Kul village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T04:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T04:30:10Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirzaim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8898},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8920},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":9143},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":9372},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":9606},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":9846},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10093},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10345},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10604},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10869},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":11140},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":11164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.12},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.16},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.71},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.76},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":183.52,"local_amount":8898,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8940.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777244,"comment":null},{"amount":183.98,"local_amount":8920,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8962.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427092,"comment":null},{"amount":188.57,"local_amount":9143,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":9186.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-12T01:03:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610477,"name":"Monicah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monicah is 66 years old and does livestock farming in Kangundo town.

Due to a lack of family income, he chose to work as a taxi driver because it is the only source of work which allows him to earn enough income to meet the family\u2019s expenses. He has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns enough from this employment to support the needs of his family. \r\nHe likes his job and he has very good relationships with his customers because he is a very responsible and skilled driver. Being the only financial provider for his family, he has not been able to save money for the days when business is slow or he has problems with his vehicle.

is a 37-year-old married woman. She is mother of six children and living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\nShe has been running a business selling clothes for many years. She purchases a variety of clothes from the main city and then sells them to the people of her vicinity. She has become famous for selling good quality clothes in her community. She has spent all of her money on household expenses and does not have any money left to buy stocks of clothing. \r\n\r\nShe requested a loan from BRAC to buy stocks of different clothes for the winter season because the winter season is going to be starting soon, by taking into account the choices and tastes of her customers. In this way, she would be able to earn more income through her greater sales. She hopes to have a good experience with this new loan and wants to grow her business. \r\n\r\nRehana is in her 4th loan cycle with a good repayment history. She dreams of giving a good and quality education to her children through all her hard efforts in her business.

Oyungerel, 45 years old, lives with her husband and three children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger on a plot of land. She has been working as a bookkeeper at the hospital since 2010. Her husband is unemployed and currently stays at home. Their older two children both go to high school while the youngest one is in kindergarten. She is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT to purchase felts, fiberglass and foam to insulate her Mongolian traditional ger.

Javahir, with the help of her daughter, is breeding livestock including cows and hens. They are also cultivating alfalfa, tomato and watermelon. Livestock breeding and plant cultivation are very important sources of income for the family. To be able to continue it, Javahir needs a loan of USD 1,500 to purchase fertilizers and feed for the livestock.

However, thanks to her hard work during recent times, Javahir was able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Realizing the importance of his business and taking into account that it is the only source of income for the family, Aghasi wants to purchase his own car. The income that Aghasi gets is hardly enough for covering family's daily costs, so he was able to save little money for purchasing new car. For the other part of money he has applied to SEF for a loan. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So, this loan is very important for Aghasi to be able to purchase a minibus and enlarge his business. \r\nAghasi hopes for lenders' trust and support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":177.46,"image":{"id":1436219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for new minibus ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Gyumri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aghasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16833.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18298.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":17863.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":17916.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18833.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18698.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19563.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19283.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":19752.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":19551.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20642.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20494.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20673.7},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":21372.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":21450.7},{"due_date":"2014-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":21778.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22203.8},{"due_date":"2015-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":22288.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":23002.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":23261.3},{"due_date":"2015-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":23546.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":23823.2},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":24271.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":24595.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.62},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.45},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":35141.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":35799.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157478,"comment":null},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":17902.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":18237.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308549,"comment":null},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":17946.7,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":18282.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845835,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T23:53:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":610541,"name":"Simba Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamza is in his thirties and married with three children.

Ella forma parte del grupo Pe\u00f1itas tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre con el se\u00f1or Sixto. Juntos han formado una familia con tres hijas las cuales se encuentran estudiando.

Do\u00f1a Ade platica como adquiri\u00f3 su invernadero \u201cA m\u00ed siempre me ha gustado el campo, siempre quise tener un invernadero sin embargo no ten\u00eda el dinero suficiente para construir uno\".  Para la estructura de un buen invernadero se necesita de un buen capital, comenta ella, \"...pero no me quede con las ganas de sembrar verduras: arm\u00e9 un peque\u00f1o huerto con material desechable como palos delgados y algunos costales ya viejos para poder cubrir mis hortalizas\". Do\u00f1a Ade siempre trabaj\u00f3 con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n para obtener buenas cosechas, pero un d\u00eda tuvo la oportunidad de poder pedir un invernadero fue un apoyo por parte de un programa del gobierno. Para Ade, esta noticia fue muy agradable, el solo tener ya todo la estructura la cual es muy cara la hizo muy feliz. Do\u00f1a Ade tiene ya nueve a\u00f1os con su invernadero en el cual siembra toda clase de verdura por varios meses ella se dedica a trabajar muy duro,  para despu\u00e9s vender su verdura con sus vecinos nunca le ha gustado salir a vender en las plazas ni en los mercados. Con su venta le va muy bien porque sus vecinos le compran toda su mercanc\u00eda, muchas veces ya no tiene que salir a vender porque llegan a su casa a comprarle. Sin embargo, el \u00fanico reto de Do\u00f1a Ade es la falta de agua para poder regar sus plantas, en la comunidad donde ella vive est\u00e1 prohibido utilizar el agua potable y cuando llueve capta toda el agua posible para utilizarla como riego en su invernadero. El verdadero problema es en tiempo de sequ\u00eda muchas veces teme perder toda su cosecha. La meta de Ade es poder sembrar en cantidades grandes para poder vender o entregar a los se\u00f1ores directamente que se dediquen a la venta de la verdura, tambi\u00e9n desea llegar a tener un local propio en un lugar m\u00e1s c\u00e9ntrico para ella misma vender su verdura. \n\nAs\u00ed como Ade tiene sue\u00f1os los miembros del grupo tambi\u00e9n quieren cumplir los suyos es por eso que est\u00e1n solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para invertir en sus negocios: Bibiana en juguetes para los dulces de algodones, Juana en conejos, Ines en pollos y guajolotes, Luis en su taller, Irineo en avena, Andres en taxis, Martha en tienda de abarrotes y Virginia en ropa.

She is part of the group Penitas, is 31 years old, and lives with her common-law husband Sixto . Together they have formed a family with three daughters who are all in school. Ade has had a greenhouse for the past nine years and is currently requesting a loan from Kiva and VisionFund to buy more seeds of cilantro, tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, etc. She needs the money to be able to continue planting vegetables. Without the loan it will be difficult to buy the seeds because the cost has risen sharply. Ade tells us how she acquired her greenhouse: \"I always liked working in the fields, I always wanted a greenhouse but had not enough money to build one.\" For a good greenhouse structure, she needed good capital , she says \"... but I still wanted to plant vegetables. I built a small kitchen garden with disposable materials like thin sticks and some old sacks to cover my vegetables .\" Ade always worked with great dedication to get good crops, but one day she had the opportunity to request a greenhouse from a government program . For Ade, this news was very welcome. Just having the structure (which is very expensive) made \u200b\u200bher very happy. Ade has had this greenhouse for nine years and she grows all kinds of vegetables for several months. She works very heard and then sells her vegetables to her neighbors as she never liked going out to sell on the streets or in the markets. Her sales are very good because her neighbors buy all her merchandise. She often no longer has to go out and sell because they come to her house to buy. Nevertheless, the only challenge Ade faces is the lack of water to irrigate her plants. In the community where she lives it is prohibited to use the drinking water for crops so, when it rains, she captures as much water as possible to use as her greenhouse irrigation. The real problem is that in times of drought she often fears losing her entire crop. Ade's goal is to plant in large quantities to sell or deliver directly to her customers She also wants to have a stall in a more central location from which she can sell her vegetables.  \r\nAde has dreams and the other group members also want to fulfill theirs and this is why they are requesting a loan to invest in their businesses: Bibiana will invest in toys for cotton candy; Juana in rabbits, chickens and turkeys; Ines Luis in her workshop; Irenaeus in oats; Andres in taxis; Martha in a grocery store; and Virginia in clothes. The Penitas group is located in a very beautiful community that is characterized by its large trees and by the fact that it is usually very cold. The group consists of 11 people who are very hardworking and responsible and who always try to be very punctual in any situation where they need to get together and talk. They chose the name of their group because it is the name of their community and it is in the Mazahua language. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3609.38,"image":{"id":1441299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more seeds such as cilantro, tomato, carrots, lettuce, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Oro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-28T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-28T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":4125,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irineo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6750},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":515.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1546.88,"local_amount":20250,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20250.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991823,"comment":null},{"amount":1031.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":13500.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644470,"comment":null},{"amount":1031.25,"local_amount":13500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13500.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877931,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-28T20:45:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":613744,"name":"Sergio Armando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio es un joven muy trabajador, labora en una peque\u00f1a empresa de transporte de carga y filmaciones de eventos, cada d\u00eda Sergio trabaja alrededor de 9 horas al d\u00eda y los fines de semana puede trabajar hasta 12 horas, ya que filma en los eventos; Sergio cree que est\u00e1 saliendo adelante porque es responsable y le gusta su trabajo.\n\nSergio est\u00e1 muy agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a la ayuda que le han brindado el podr\u00e1 realizar los tr\u00e1mites de su t\u00edtulo universitario, ya que el logro estudiar la carrera de administraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed el podr\u00e1 buscar un mejor empleo y mejorar sus ingresos, y seguir luchando para hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Tener un mejor empleo y ayudar a su familia\u201d\n","en":"Sergio is a very hardworking young man, he works in a small business  dealing with cargo shipping and the filming of events.
