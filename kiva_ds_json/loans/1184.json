She tells us that her most difficult challenge has been raising her children, although she enjoys caring for them and attending church. \r\n\r\nMartha is very excited about receiving her seventh loan from Esperanza Internacional, having repaid her previous loan satisfactorily and taken an important step toward growing her business.

In 2001, Walace established his first business, ShowOff Marketing, a promotions company that worked directly with independent artists, musicians, and movie crews. Through this work, Walace learned about the specific marketing needs of local artists. It was this inspiration that prompted him to begin his new company, Merch-A-Lot, which creates professionally branded products and promotional materials for artists to sell to their audiences.\n\nWalace is looking to expand his business and offer more products to his clients. This loan will help him purchase necessary materials and equipment for t-shirt screening and to create more professional branding images and to hire a part-time employee.

She lives in her parents home located in a rural district.\r\n\r\nMerlinia works in agriculture and the cattle industry for a living. Two years ago she inherited a plot of land. There she grows potatoes, broad beans, peas and corn. She started cultivating all at once, but she realized that growing one product was more profitable due to the amount harvested. That's why this year she grew potatoes, which she sold successfully. Now she wants to grow corn and gladiolas since the climate and the month are favorable in order to obtain a good harvest and profits. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime she works taking care of her animals, from which she also obtains an income. For example, from selling the milk and the cheeses she prepares. Her activities are constant, which is why she needs help this time in order to improve the quality of the milk her animals produce. This is her second loan with Kiva and she's thankful for the financial support she receives to get ahead. She also commits to pay her dues in a timely fashion.

She has two minor children:  one son and one daughter.  Jyldyzkhan has a high school education.  Her neighbors have very good things to say about her.  They say she is a good and hard working woman.  Since 2009 the main source of her family's income has been Jyldyzkhan's business of selling dairy products.  She started her business with 30,000 som (KGS) and thanks to her hard work, she has been able to develop her business and increase her range of products and now her business brings in about 5,000 som (KGS) per month.  This is the basis for covering her family's expenses for food and daily needs.  Her profits have also enabled her to increase her turnover.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her business, Jyldyzkhan applied to the microcredit bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) for the wholesale purchase of dairy products for her inventory.   Jyldyzkhan plans to reinvest the profits from her loan in further expanding her business and, in the future, she wants to give her children a decent

She used to dedicate herself exclusively to selling cheese and tending to her farmland and her cow. She still does this, but not on her own anymore, as her family helps her. Little more than a year ago, she opened a small grocery shop on her town's main square, where she sells first-necessity food products, such as rice, milk, sugar, and others. Of course, she also takes advantage of this shop to sell the produce from her farm and the cheese she churns, which helps attract more customers. Her business is prospering and she hopes to increase her working capital in order to keep growing. This is her second loan with Kiva and she is very grateful for all the financial support she receives, thanks to which she can improve her lot in life. She promises to be punctual in her repayments.

She was married, but now she is divorced. It was a heavy blow for her. Muhtarama has four children, and despite being divorced and having to raise the children herself, she never lost heart and continued onward. \r\n\r\nOf course it was very hard for her to raise and support her children, but she has striven for them to always be fed and clothed. In turn, her children have been very grateful to their mother, so they are very caring and always try to support her in everything.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn money for living costs, Muhtarama has set up a business. She works with selling seasonal clothing. She has managed this business for more than 13 years. She purchases goods at the wholesale market and brings them to her village to sell. This business gives her a good income. \r\n\r\nMuhtarama would like to increase the income received, and therefore she needs to expand the business. As it is currently the season for selling school clothing, Muhtarama would like to purchase more goods and expand her business. She turned to \"Arvand\" for a loan in order to purchase clothing to sell.

Her husband owns a clothing business which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of the business. For this, Shamim, as a member of two persons lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit amount, he will put aside some savings amount to pay for the electricity and gas bill. Shamim hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

His wife is a housewife and she helps him with his business. They are both on a pension, but they do not sit idly by. In search of a source of income for his family, Shavraly started working with field crop cultivation and livestock breeding in 1993. Having started with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS), his business currently brings in a monthly profit of around 9,000 som (KGS). His business includes three horses, four dairy cows with offspring and 60 sheep. \r\n\r\nShavraly also has a plot of land of the size of 2.40 hectares, where he mainly grows beans and perennial grasses. The eldest son, who is a migrant worker in Russia, also sends additional financial aid. \r\n\r\nTo further develop his business, Shavraly turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tuhsum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep. Shavraly plans to spend the income from the loan on increasing the number of livestock."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":197.55,"image":{"id":1402964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has specialized secondary education. Since 1982 she has worked with farming - livestock breeding and field crop cultivation - after having started this business with a sum of 9,000 som (KGS). Her husband and children help her with the business. \r\n\r\nThanks to Naarkul's persistent work, she currently has a good farm: One dairy cow, one steer and five sheep. She also has 3.15 hectares of irrigated land available, on which she plants wheat and barley every year. The income allowed Naarkul to multiply the number of livestock at the far, and thereby improve the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Naarkul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of steers. Naarkul plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock, and in the future she also plans to repair her

The income allowed Tinatin to multiply the number of livestock in her family and at the same time increase the family's well-being. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business Tinatin turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of a cow with offspring.
