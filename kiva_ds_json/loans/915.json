Two of her children are still in school. She has opened a bar near her home, in one of the capital city\u2019s districts, and has been managing it for 10 years already. Her business is going well thanks to the friendly welcome she offers to customers as well as to her long experience allowing her to attract a sizeable clientele. However, the substantial growth of her customer base prevents her from keeping up with the demand, given her limited capital, which is why the present loan is so important to her business at this moment. The loan will allow Catherine to add more cases of beverages, thus not only meeting demand but increasing her sales volume and her revenues. She will reinvest one part of the revenues in her business and use the rest to provide for everyday family needs.

When she does not have a lot of time, she leaves it and returns to it later. One of her difficulties is that she gives credit, and sometimes her customers don't make their payments on time. She needs the loan to buy more of a variety of beauty products such as nail polish, eyeshadow, eyeliner and lip liner, and mascara, among other items. The loans she has obtained have helped her to have her own house, because she didn't have it before. One of her difficulties is that she sells door-to-door, and when she gets paid she has to walk around with cash. She has been robbed several times. Her goal is to work very hard every day in order to have her own store.

Thanks to the good service that she offers, she has managed to win over a great number of customers.\r\n\r\nEver since she opened her restaurant her family\u2019s financial conditions have improved considerably.  This allows her children to have access to a better quality of education.  It also allows the whole family to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThanks to her sales she is now able to generate two jobs, and this makes her feel very proud.  She is able to contribute to the income of two people who need it for their families.

This way she will be able to increase her restaurant\u2019s capacity.

She will be able to tend to a lot of customers that she previously did not have the capacity to serve.  Also, her household income will increase considerably.  Her family will continue enjoying a very good quality of life.  They will even have better financial opportunities to pay for their children\u2019s university

She also has in her care another person. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is a merchant and has opened a perfume shop, which she has been running in a district in the capital for three years. Her small shop is operating well enough, however the problem is a lack of diversification in her business and also a meager stock of body lotions. This is because of a burgeoning demand for jewelry and body lotion. She has had trouble satisfying this customer demand. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, she is requesting a loan that will help her to stock up more on body lotions, as well as jewelry, enabling her to meet the needs of her customers. Her sales will then increase and her profits too as a result. \r\n\r\nShe will save some of her profits with the goal of opening a bar in the near future, and the rest will enable her to support her family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1157664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Desde muy temprana edad aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de su madre quien se dedicaba a esta actividad y gracias a esto logr\u00f3 adquirir una gran experiencia para que sus clientes reciban un muy buen trabajo. Con unos ahorros y un gran esfuerzo logr\u00f3 comprar una m\u00e1quina con la que comenz\u00f3 a ofrecer el servicio de confecci\u00f3n a terceros desde su hogar, y gracias a que ha ido progresando poco a poco ha ido comprando las m\u00e1quinas necesarias para ofrecer un buen servicio a sus clientes.

Her business activity is making clothes.  Thanks to this, she generates income with which she is able to contribute, with her mother, to covering their expenses.   She also helps her life partner cover their household expenses and her ten month old son\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nShe learned this business activity from her mother at a very early age.  Her mother devoted herself to this business activity, and thanks to this Alejandra managed to acquire great experience so that her customers receive very good work.\r\n\r\nWith some savings and great effort she managed to buy a machine with which she started to offer, from home, her sewing services to third parties. Thanks to the fact that it has been progressing little by little, she has been buying the machines needed to offer her customers good service.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that she does not have all of the machines needed to finish sewing the garments, she needs to pay a third party to do some sewing processes.  This reduces her profits considerably.   That is why she now looks to a loan to buy an overlock machine and an upholstery machine in order to be able to have the machinery she needs to be able complete the process of making the clothes.\r\n\r\nHer profits will increase considerably this way.  She will not have to pay high costs to another person to do the sewing process that she could not do in her shop due to lack of machinery.  Her biggest dream is to have a large sewing shop and to provide her ten month old son with a stable financial future and a good quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1262.71,"image":{"id":1132917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

This business is his source of income and the source of income for his home, where he lives with his wife and their 2 children.  Thanks to this business, he has managed to get ahead in spite of the adversity he has faced, and he has also been able to provide his children with access to a good quality education.  \r\n\r\nSome time ago, when he started his business, he was offering a very small quantity of merchandise for sale and so his sales were sporadic as his customers did not have confidence in buying from his shop.  However, thanks to the good service he provides in his business, he has managed to make himself known to a lot of people and so has gradually made progress with his business.  One advantage that he has always had is that he is known to be a very friendly and generous person.  This has allowed him to get to know a lot of people in his town, and as a result the clientele of his business has increased a lot.  \r\n\r\nIn the coming months, one of his sons will start at the university, and since this brings considerable costs Manuel must increase his sales so that he will have enough money to pay the university fees.

","en":"Abduhamid is a good family man and entrepreneur.  He is married and raising three children.  Abduhamid has been involved in buying and selling livestock feed for four years.  He obtained his first loan in 2010 to increase goods turnover.  Since then, he expanded his merchandise selection with the help of that loan.  He previously only sold feed and dried grass for livestock and now added oil-cake.  He travels to the city and various regions for merchandise every time using his passenger car, but needs a large truck in order to deliver a large inventory of goods.  Abduhamid wants to use this loan to buy a \"Porter\" car and, thanks to the financial support, would be able to bring in more goods in one trip and make more

Since he comes from a family of limited economic means, he was obligated to find work so that he will be able to earn his own income and in this way hope to be able to save enough money to pay the university. \r\n\r\nThanks to the fact that he knows a lot of people, his neighbors, relatives and friends, Cristian\u2019s sales have been very good.

From a very early age she learned the trade from her family which has always lived in the country and been involved in this and other business activities.  With so many years of experience, she now has knowledge about livestock farming, vaccination, birthing piglets, etc.  And she is well-known for raising very heavy pigs which makes them more attractive to sell and this has given her a good customer base for her business.

She always felt inclined towards this type of work and when she needed to generate income for her household this was her first choice.  Luz is a single mother, head of a family of two children and with her fast food business she has managed to generate the sufficient income to provide for them a good quality of life and better economic opportunities so that they can gain access to a better quality of education.  When the father of her children abandoned her and she was left in charge of all the household duties, Luz and her children suffered great economic difficulties but thanks to her efforts in her business she has been able to overcome the difficulties and provide her children with a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nIn her business she has very good sales motivated principally by the good quality of her food but due to the fact that she does not have a great deal of capital she has not been able to continue making her business grow and improving the products that she offers her customers.  It is for this reason that Luz seeks a loan, in order to buy supplies for fast food preparation and thus to be able to respond to all of the orders of her customers.\r\n\r\nIn this way her business will have the opportunity to continue growing and providing good care to her customers.

They are hospitable people, like our members, and they still maintain the culture and traditions of their villages.

He does this in the morning because in the afternoon he also home delivers large containers of bottled water which produces a bit of extra profit for him.  He\u2019s been in business more than 8 years but he used to do it with a three-wheeled cart until he bought his car which even though is a bit deteriorated is still very useful.\r\n\r\nThey hope to use this loan to buy fish, plantain and to repair their car.
