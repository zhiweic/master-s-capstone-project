","en":"Mamadmuso is 53 years old, married, and has three sons. He and his family live in the Khuroson district. Two of his sons are currently working abroad. For the past five years Mamadmuso has been raising farm animals, a business which he learned from his father as a child.

She belongs to a group of people who request loans from Visi\u00f3nFund to improve their businesses and be able to support their families.\n\nAle, as she's known affectionately, is 27 years old and studied up to the third year of secondary school.  She says she didn't continue with her studies because she lacked the capital and her parents weren't able to continue supporting her anymore.  She has two children, one in elementary school and one who's five months old.\n\nShe says she makes a living selling fruits and vegetables in the town market.  She goes to the distribution center early in the day to stock up by choosing the best produce that's not bruised.  This way she can finish selling early.  She sells by the bag: avocado, Manzano peppers, blackberries, mango, peaches, and seasonal fruits and vegetables.\n\nMaking little bags earns her a bit more, she says.  She goes around the market selling from a bucket.  She likes what she does because she has time for her home and her children.  Her mother helps her by taking care of the children, and when she can't, Alejandra takes her child in one hand, her bucket in the other, and her baby in her shawl on her back, and goes out to sell.\n\nHer dream is to set up a stall outside the town market so she won't have to walk from one place to another, which is very tiring.\n\nShe says she's requesting her loan to stock up on seasonal fruits and vegetables because she wants to buy a bit more to increase her profits and give her young children a better quality of life.\n\nThe other members of the group are Nemesia, Mar\u00eda Cristina, Laura Cecilia, Mar\u00eda Teresa, Alicia, Araceli, Jazm\u00edn, Bel\u00e9n, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Alberta, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Rosalba, Jannet, Patricia, Tatiana, and Elisenia.

has loved styling hair since she was a little girl. So when it came time to choose a profession, it was clear to her that offering salon services was her calling. A mother of three girls, Tenesha said her hairstyling business provides for her children, and her hairstyling skills are useful for her girls at home.\n\nThrough her San Antonio business, Onyx Mobile Beauty Salon, Tenesha offers men and women the latest in hair care and spa services.  The salon on wheels is convenient and comes to clients when they schedule an appointment. Tenesha offers clients styles and cuts for men and women, extensions, braids, spa services, and beard trims, as well as teen spa and beauty packages, and bridal packages for their special days.  \n\nOriginally from Michigan, Tenesha continued her mobile hair care services when she moved to Texas. She got her big break when a stranger at a store saw the advertising on her truck and approached her about helping elderly people at nursing homes. \n\nTenesha said whether her clients are elderly or teen-aged, she treats everybody with respect and as an individual.\n\n\u201cYou have to be patient and gentle with everybody,\u201d Tenesha said. \u201cBut with kids you have to move quickly because they lose attention quickly.\u201d \n\nTenesha recently came to Accion Texas Inc. when an Accion employee informed her about the great services and loan programs the organization offers.  Tenesha is using her loan to pay for minor repairs on her business\u2019s mobile trailer and to hire three part-time stylists to assist with the upcoming summer months.  Tenesha is accustomed to the increase in business over the summer months due to clients planning summer weddings and other events during warmer weather.  \n\n\u201cI like working with all types of people,\u201d she said.\n\nAlong with everyday salon services, Tenesha also offers special pricing packages for groups of six or more.  Packages include a princess inspired teen party, all male spa and haircut party, and bridal party extravaganzas all at reasonable prices.  Each client will be treated to an oasis with the very best massage, pedicure, manicure, and hair style suitable for any occasion. \n\nShe is grateful to have her Accion loan to increase her working capital and hire help during this time.

Peddy has requested a loan of $500 to order more cloth fabric and thread to make bedspread covers, curtains and seat covers. \r\n\r\nShe says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to pay fees for her four children in high school and primary school It will also pay other business expenses and rentals.

In this special loan, Mercedes is representing her church from the community of Peralta from the North of Santo Domingo. They (the church) started a water project two years ago, in order to provide purified water to their community inhabitants, delivering the service at a low price but with high quality and the proper standards.\n\nWith this loan they want to buy a truck to pick up and distribute the water to sellers and clients all over their community; also to restructure their distribution point where they sterilize gallons, fill bottles with purified water and deliver them to the neighbors that go directly to the business to buy them or sellers that distribute them. By \"improve,\" they mean to buy 5-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and other investments.\n\nMercedes is the pastor in this church and also is in change of the water project called Agua Vida Sana (Water Healthy Lives). In their neighborhood live around 15 thousand people, and their plan is to distribute purified water to 2500 families, at a cost of $0.50 US for a 5-gallon bottle of water. With this, Mercedes said, they want to impact different areas: economic, health, spiritual and many others. This community is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many health problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. This project is planning to distribute 300 of these bottles for at least 2500 families and businesses daily. This church is committed to starting as many projects as they can to contribute to the development of this community.\n\nMercedes thanks God, Esperanza Internacional, and all of you for this opportunity. In her name and the name of all of her church members, she thanks all of you for your support!

This area has lush vegetation because of all the farming fields and its geography offers beautiful landscapes. The main activity in this community is raising animals, farming, and many of its residents work different jobs in the city of Cuenca. The members of this group, as well as all of the townspeople, are kind, amiable, and, most of all, fighters who work very hard every day in order to give their children the best. They also still keep their culture and traditions alive. \r\n\r\nClara is one of the members of this group. She and her friends and fellow members of the Mira communal bank are on their third loan. She likes this type of lending because the loans are short-term and help their small businesses grow. \r\n\r\nClara is 28 years old and is a single mother. Her two children are ages nine and five, and go to a small local school. She doesn't own a home, which is why she lives in her parents' house and shares household expenses with them. \r\n\r\nClara takes care of her children and works hard daily in the fields.

He lives in the small village of Shuakhevi District with his wife and three children. Several times, Ramaz requested a loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, the family has a plot of agricultural land where potatoes, haricot, maize, and nut trees are grown. In addition, they have milking cows whose milk is used in cheese products. They sell the harvested products and cheese locally, at a good price. The income is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Ramaz will purchase bee-hives with bee-colonies. After purchasing bee-hives with bee-colonies, the family will be able to produce honey for sale. Honey is a highly-demanded product, as well as very profitable, so Ramaz hopes this will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Lana will purchase a stock of groceries and resell at higher prices. She has no experience in this field, but she is very motivated to work hard for a better future. Lana hopes that her business will be successful, as she feels the whole family standing by her.

He wishes to plaster and paint the walls  and put a concrete floor in his baby's room so she will be safer and more comfortable.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":408.93,"image":{"id":1359093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Make improvements to his baby's bedroom","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T19:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T19:40:01Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Erick Alain ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":140.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":143.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":149.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":157.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":161.44},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":174.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":181.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":190.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":195.53},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":203.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.77},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.77},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.22,"local_amount":274.12,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":282.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776096,"comment":null},{"amount":55.77,"local_amount":143.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":148.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779243,"comment":null},{"amount":57.94,"local_amount":149.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054428,"comment":null},{"amount":60.9,"local_amount":157.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":161.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819336,"comment":null},{"amount":62.56,"local_amount":161.44,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":166.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472294,"comment":null},{"amount":65.54,"local_amount":169.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":174.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694795,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-01T16:49:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":564727,"name":"Karolina Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Karolina habita en el municipio de Ticuantepe junto a su familia, quienes desde hace mucho tiempo trabajan cultivando la tierra, actualmente tiene una manzana de pi\u00f1a quien necesita darle mantenimiento para que su cosecha sea de calidad y poder combatir las plagas, con este credito comprara insumos como: Triple, Completo, Urea, etc, Agradece el apoyo y la confianza que Afodenic y Fondos Kiva le han brindado.","en":"Karolina lives in the municipality of Ticuantepe with her family who have for a long time, worked by cultivating the earth.

age 57, runs a family dairy farm. He lives in the small village of Khulo District with his wife, two sons, two daughters-in-law, and three grandchildren. The family is actively involved in agricultural activities. They have milk cows and sell cheese products. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land where they grow potatoes, maize, and walnut trees. They sell the harvested products locally. The farm produces barely enough to adequately support the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.  \r\n\r\nNodar would like to start up a grocery store business. He has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up capital, but without success. His loan request was rejected each time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n  \r\nNodar has now requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. He has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Nodar will open a grocery store. He will purchase a stock of groceries and also renovate a space near the family house to open his shop. Though Nodar has no experience as yet, he is very motivated to make his new business a success and to increase the income of his family. \r\n\r\nThis new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 31 years old. He lives in a small village of Ozurgeti District, with his wife, parents, grandmother, and an infant daughter. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. Ramaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nBesides Ramaz's grandmother's pension, the only source of income for the family is their agricultural activities. In particular, they have milking cows, whose milk is used in dairy products. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and nut trees are grown.  They sell the harvested produce and dairy products locally, at good prices. They earn hardly enough for food, for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ramaz has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to other credit products.

Though they pool their income, it is hardly enough to provide sufficient food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLela would like to start a clothes trading business. She is experienced in this field as she was involved in a trading business three years ago. She has requested loans from local financial institutions several times to obtain family business start-up capital, but without success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nLela has now requested a loan from Credo in order to start up her clothes trading business, and she has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Lela will begin trading in clothing items. She plans to go to Turkey, where she will purchase clothing from wholesalers, and then she will resell these items among her local villagers at a higher price. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1364741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to begin a clothes trading business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kurdghelauri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T21:10:13Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.36,"local_amount":43.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613699,"comment":null},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":45.31,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":45.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857411,"comment":null},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":46.48,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":46.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134059,"comment":null},{"amount":48.4,"local_amount":48.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":48.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107648,"comment":null},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":48.93,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":48.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255189,"comment":null},{"amount":767.52,"local_amount":767.52,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":767.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019327,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-09T01:43:41Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":565387,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a small one, locally working as an artisan. It is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nDavit requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Davit has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit, Davit will purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver. This will increase the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1364775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a car and work as a taxi driver.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Chiatura","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Davit","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.96},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":65.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.78},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102.65},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.96},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.71},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.01},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.03},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.91},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.2},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.65},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567949,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas, age 52, operates two businesses to earn an income.

Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is a small income of her husband, working as an artisan. It is hardly enough money for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nKhatia requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Khatia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Khatia will begin to trade in clothing. She plans to purchase clothing at wholesale prices and then resell them at a higher price. This will increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":230.96,"image":{"id":1364783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to begin to trade in clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kutaisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-06-03T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-03T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khatia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.86},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.95},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.99,"local_amount":35.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613701,"comment":null},{"amount":36.92,"local_amount":36.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":36.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857413,"comment":null},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":37.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":37.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134061,"comment":null},{"amount":39.17,"local_amount":39.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":39.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107650,"comment":null},{"amount":39.86,"local_amount":39.86,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":39.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255191,"comment":null},{"amount":41.15,"local_amount":41.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":41.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019329,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-06T11:01:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567936,"name":"Tahir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tahir is 57 years old and married with three children.

Cochineal is an insect that is used to give color to various products, especially textiles.

She lives in Batumi District with her husband, two children and father-in-law. Madona requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMadona has been renting out a commercial space, which is the only source of income for her family. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMadona requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

His loan requests were rejected every time, because of his low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is agricultural activities. In particular, they have two pigs and eight beehives with bee colonies. They sell honey locally at a good price. Besides this, he works as an artisan and gets a small income. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the poor subsistence category. \r\n\r\nElguja requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Elguja has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, passed the Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and one will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\nMarpu has a table business from which she sells palm oil, rice, etc for the past 10 years. She works ten hours a day at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is the small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.

Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya, close to the Ugandan border. It contains the only tropical rain forest in Kenya, and the variety of the flora in the region makes it well-suited for beekeeping. It has one of the highest rural population densities in the world (in some areas, close to 600 people per square kilometer), which may contribute to the region's high poverty rates.<p>\r\n\r\nMalach, who is unmarried, has been farming for four years, currently growing vegetables of various types on his land.

is a businesswoman from Liberia.

She did not go to school, but she is good at managing her business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Bardnersville.  Bardnersville is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Meme has had a table business which sells fish.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

is a 40 year-old businesswoman from Liberia.  She is single and has five children, aged between 26 and 14. Three of her children are currently attending school and live at home.  She completed grade 6th before starting her business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Patricia has had a table business which sells sugar, palm oil, rice, etc.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

is a 47 year-old businesswoman from Liberia.  She is single and has nine children, aged between 24 and 13. Only two of her children are currently attending school and live at home.  She was a college student, and she is good at managing her business.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Bardnersville.  Bardnersville is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Mabel has had a table business which sells palm oil, rice, etc.  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

is a business woman from Liberia.  She is married and has four children, aged between 19 and 12. Only two of her children are currently attending school and live at home.  She did not go to school, and joined business to make her life easier.  She describes herself as working woman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nFor the past ten years, Rebecca has had a table business which sells slippers, body cream, etc..  She works ten hours a day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is a small income. She intends to use the loan to buy more slippers, body cream, etc. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because she makes more profit.  She hopes to one day own a house.  \r\n\r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

She describes herself as a hardworking businesswoman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in St. Paul. St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for fish due to its location by the sea. St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Freeport. It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in substandard housing.\r\n \r\nNaoh has a table business where she has sold dry and fresh fish in the local market for the past 14 years. She started her business by selling for her friends. She likes her business because she makes a profit. She works ten hours at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is small income. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use the loan to buy inventory. She hopes to one day own a house.\r\n  \r\nThank you for supporting the borrowers at BRAC

is a charming 31-year-old lady who is engaged in animal breeding. She is married and lives with her husband and two children in the town of Sevan. Her husband is a driver and works hard days and nights in order to sustain his family, so Susanna is in charge of the upbringing of their children. \r\n\r\nSusanna has a higher education and for five years she used to work as an accountant in Sevan. But for more than two years she has been jobless and so she raises cows, bulls and chickens at her farm. The products from farming Susanna sells in the Sevan food markets. She says that raising animals is a very hard occupation, especially for women, but at the same time it is very profitable. Susanna does her best to ensure a good future for her children.\r\n\r\nSusanna decided to increase the number of her animals and for this she asks a loan from Kiva lenders to buy two calves and fodder for animals. This is the sixth loan from Nor Horizon for Susanna and the first one from Kiva, and she hopes that her first deal with Kiva will have a good success for her agricultural business.

Battsetseg, 36 years old, lives with her husband and five children in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia.

Her husband currently runs a framing workshop; he makes and sells frames to local vendors. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in is very small and can't provide enough space for this seven-member family.

She has a house made from adobe where she lives together with her four children.  Two of her children work independently.\r\n\r\nJulia has worked in the fields since she was a young girl, growing regional produce such as organic cacao, coffee, etc. and supporting her parents.  When she was old enough, she got engaged and formed her own family, receiving a plot of farmland from her in-laws so that she could financially provide for her children.  Julia has managed to make progress.  Nine years ago, she opened a small food store where she works when she finishes her tasks in the fields.  In order to keep her plants in good condition, she hires local workers who support her in different tasks such as weeding and harvesting.  She then sells her crops to local salespeople, thereby recouping the money she originally invested and making additional profits.  \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Julia would like to borrow 1,000 soles to buy sacks of organic fertilizer for her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":247.56,"image":{"id":1361866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T15:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T15:10:01Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":103.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":112.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":116.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.36,"local_amount":75.62,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975755,"comment":null},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":91.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997022,"comment":null},{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":94.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":94.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864492,"comment":null},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":91.24,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352860,"comment":null},{"amount":37.66,"local_amount":100.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904630,"comment":null},{"amount":38.91,"local_amount":103.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090647,"comment":null},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":103.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":103.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777351,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T15:11:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":566431,"name":"Geisel Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Geisel, de 33 a\u00f1os habitante del Reparto Schick en Managua, una zona donde hay mucha delincuencia y pobreza, ella se dedica a vender productos variados de pl\u00e1sticos, junto a su esposo intenta como salir adelante para mantener la educaci\u00f3n de sus 2 hijos de 11 y 15 a\u00f1os de edad quienes van a la escuela y requieren de un cuidado especial por el reparto donde habitan.

This is 38-year-old Onias from Bulawayo. He is married with three children and two attending school. He also cares for one dependent. Onias runs a retail business which sells cellphones and accessories, including chargers, pouches, earphones and memory cards. He also sells clothing items, such as kids wear, shoes, and jackets.The business has been in operation for two years. He says the main challenge he faces is competition from bigger retailers who offer credit to customers.

She believes she\u2019s moving forward because she\u2019s kind to her customers and above all because she doesn\u2019t let adversities defeat her.\r\n\r\nYsabel is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided she will be able to buy a locale for her business because she doesn\u2019t have one at present and in this way she won\u2019t have to pay rental anymore and her income will improve so she will be able to continue striving to make her greatest dream reality: to finish building her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.88,"image":{"id":1362629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy a locale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-04T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-04T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":69.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":74.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78.41},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":84.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.27},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":103.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.4},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.26},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.65,"local_amount":63.06,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664576,"comment":null},{"amount":52.89,"local_amount":141.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-21T08:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":141.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776191,"comment":null},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":74.31,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":74.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054466,"comment":null},{"amount":29.4,"local_amount":78.41,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":78.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819375,"comment":null},{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":80.69,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":81.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472329,"comment":null},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":84.84,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T19:45:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568253,"name":"Fouzia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fouzia is a 35-year-old woman.

She belongs to \u201cRose Lom Group\u201d and she is pictured with her hand raised. She is also the featured borrower of the group. Nenglhing subjugates all the challenges one can endure. She has seven kids and lives with her aged in-laws. Her husband earns a living as a sweeper in a military camp with a small regular monthly income.  To manage the family finances with only her husband's income was a big challenge. Debts were piling up while she was trying to look after the kids and the in-laws. School fees, medicinal cost for the in-laws and household maintenance expenses were all borne by only her husband income.\r\n\r\nNenglhing started raising piglets and slowly developed her piglet-selling business.  She is making rapid progress in her business. She usually travels across the neighboring provinces in the state and purchases piglets. The piglets are then sold in her village and the neighboring villages at a profit. She said, since each house raises pigs, selling piglets is not complicated and instead entices her to do better.  The most challenging part of her business is transportation. The public transport is the most convenient option but the passengers sometimes complain. In order not to disturb others, a private vehicle is hired to transport the piglets. The cost is high but that is the only option left for the piglet transportation. She keeps them in the pigsty at the back of her house and does the selling.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband work side by side to manage the household expenses.  With her financial assistance, the family is now able to pay back the previous debts.  She wants all of her seven kids to get an education because she was deprived of a good education in her childhood days. The family financial conditions did not allow her to pursue further studies and she ended up with a mere primary education.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase more piglets to sell and meet the demands of her customers. She is also planning to provide her customers with a credit facility if she can successfully avail the loan.  She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the undeniable support and love. She wishes them great success and prosperity. The rest of the group members are engaged in piggery, weaving and vegetable-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1365217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nNazibrola owns an internet caf\u00e9 and David is working at the local water company. Nazibrola\u2019s daughter in law is a seller at the clothes shop. They all work on small monthly salaries.\r\n \r\nNazibrola requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Nazibrola has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Nazibrola will purchase more computers for her internet caf\u00e9.

Several times, Elvin requested a loan from local financial institutions for his business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nElvin is a car artisan. He has his own workshop where he fixes damaged cars and earns a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nElvin requested loan from Credo to start-up the business. Elvin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. \r\n\r\nThe start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits, with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.
