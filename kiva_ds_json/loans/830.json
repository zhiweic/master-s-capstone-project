It was Costa Rica\u2019s capital until 1823 and seat of the first permanent international court in history, the Corte de Cartago.  Its mountainous terrain is formed by two mountain ranges: the Central and the Talamanca ranges.\r\n\r\nAlfredo is a farmer, specifically coffee.  This product is planted from small seedlings called \u201calm\u00e1cigo\u201d which is purchased as individual plants according to the available area for planting.  They can be planted to harvest the beans or to produce more seedlings to supply to other farmers.  In Alfredo\u2019s case it\u2019s both.\r\n\r\nBecause of this he\u2019s asking for a 500,000 (five-hundred thousand) colon loan to buy a certain amount of plants and to buy manure, insecticide, fungicide and other supplies needed for crop care.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan he\u2019s had with the project and it\u2019s been of great help and blessing for him and his family since he\u2019s managed to give them a better quality of life and has reached many goals thanks to the financing.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":483.71,"image":{"id":1060518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has two daughters and five sons.  She is married, and she lives in the La Concepcion village in the Juticalpa municipality.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been making and selling doughnuts and quesadillas for more than 15 years. She learned this trade because she worked with a neighbor making the same products.  She also learned thanks to several bakery courses she took at the Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her home, and still has no name. Her work schedule starts at 4:00 am, and she works with her two daughters. They help her to prepare the dough, and then spend the time it takes for the products to be in the oven. Once she takes the product out of the oven, she places it in a plastic container, and takes it to sell door-to-door to homes and businesses. She thinks that her major advantage is that her products have a special flavor, and, in addition to that, she is a friendly person who gets on well with other people.  This helps her to make sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a place in the town center, even if it is small, so that she no longer has to sell by foot and can have an easier life.  She has diabetes and is still undergoing medical treatment. Every time she returns to her home after finishing her daily work, her health suffers.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandrina is requesting is needed to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter and other ingredients to make doughnuts and quesadillas. With the help of this loan, she will be able to generate earnings and cover her medical expenses. She will also help her husband with the financial upkeep of the household.  He works in agriculture and has little income. She also would like to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been receiving the support of loans through FAMA for several years.  She has punctually paid back the loans, and they have helped her to keep her business active and to improve her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":862398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T01:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T01:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3096.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277415791,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3096.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476835,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6192.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850558,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-12T04:00:21Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410311,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, conviviente y con 2 hijos a cargo.

is 55 years old. He lives in a small village in Khoni District, West Georgia. Rezo lives with his family: his 36-year-old daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren (16 and 12 years old).  The children go to school. \r\n\r\nThe family has a pig. They sell on average 9 piglets per year. Also, Rezo and his son-in-law work as workers in the village. They perform various work when they get orders. Although all family members work hard, they still live in poverty. Their total average monthly income is 330 Laris. \r\n\r\nRezo requested credit to start-up a dairy farm. His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Rezo will purchase a milk cow. He will place it in the old cattle-shed located in his yard. He will start the production of cheese and sell it on local open market. The income for the family will increase by 150 \u2013 200 Laris, which will mean 45 \u2013 60% increase. The living conditions for the family will significantly improve and the family will have enough income to access regular credit products available on the country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":667.76,"image":{"id":1060242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy

is 45 years old. She lives in Samtredia District with her family: husband \u2013 Zviad, 19-year-old daughter, 18-year-old son, and mother-in-law. Khatuna\u2019s son goes to school and her daughter plans to enter high school next year. Khatuna works as a saleslady in a village store. She spends the whole day in the store and her monthly salary equals to 200 Laris.  Zviad takes care of a milk cow owned by the family. The dairy products are mainly consumed by the family and the surplus is sold in the village. The total average monthly income of the family is 400 Laris, including the pension of Khatuna\u2019s mother-in-law. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistent poor category. \r\n\r\nKhatuna requested credit to start-up a trade business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Khatuna will purchase a mini-bus to trade greengrocery products. Zviad will lead the business. He will purchase various greengrocery products from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price mark-up. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income for the family by 300 Laris, which will mean a 75% increase. The living conditions for the family will improve and in the future they will have enough income to access regular credit products available on country\u2019s capital market, in case of need.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1502.51,"image":{"id":1060257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband Hisham appears in her Kiva profile photo. The photo is taken next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nHelala is a thirty-seven-year-old woman. She is married and has no children yet. Her husband has been a taxi driver for twelve years which is a profitable project.\r\n\r\nHelala is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi and making some necessary repairs to it such as changing the tires and the mats. By taking this loan, Helala will help her husband to repair his taxi which is the only source of income for the family. This will improve the taxi's condition for the better and will enable Helala's husband to work extra hours and increase the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She lives in Santa Ana Parish located in southeast Cuenca.  Its climate is cold and from its central park one can view a great part of the city of Cuenca.  Its residents raise animals, farm and many of them have jobs in the city.\r\n\r\nZoila is 33 years old, married and has two children who are 10 and 8 years old and attending the local little elementary school.  Her husband is a driver and works driving his truck making deliveries.  They do not have a house of their own but live in a house belonging to relatives.\r\n\r\nZoila is in very good health as well as the other members of her family.  She has been working in a bakery for 15 years and she also has had a grocery store for the last four years.

She has been a member of Finca for 15 years; and she has been a member since she was a student.  She sells clothes and knits sweaters.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she was able to get ahead.  She remembers that on one of the Virgin de Guadalupe\u2019s birthdays she went to sing with her husband who plays the harp.  That is how she met our founders, and from that date on she has been a member of Finca.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the Virgin of Guadalupe\u2019s teachings, which she was able to put into practice.  She says that women have to work and be self-sufficient.  They need to be able to work to get their families ahead.  She has always taken that to heart.  Everything that she learned in Finca Per\u00fa not only helps her, but it also helps raising her children.  All of the values it has like responsibility and punctuality help her and her children.

She previously obtained four group loans from Soro Yiriwaso, all of which were correctly repaid. She is now seeking her third individual loan. She buys her merchandise from merchants at the big market of Bamako (capital of Mali), in Lom\u00e9, and often in Koutiala. She plans to buy 20 wax pagnes, some perfume for the incense, and many other miscellaneous items. She sells her goods to a mixed clientele in the city of Koutiala and at the weekly fairs of surrounding villages, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn a monthly profit of 95,000CFAF, which she will use to repay the loan interest and to help with the family\u2019s daily expenditures. In future years, she plans to open a shop to sell clothing and various items at the Koutiala market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1068303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy pagnes and various merchandise for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiaratou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287411016,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502844,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498889,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83529.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243219,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83529,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179694,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83529.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636141,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-25T20:35:12Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410934,"name":"Luz Mar\u00eda  (Montecristi) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal Luz Mar\u00eda  se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en Los Bajos del Cant\u00f3n Montecristi, conocido por su rica cultura pre colonial y por su artesan\u00eda que es reconocida a nivel nacional e internacional.

Most of them work in business in general.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Flor Lucciola. She is 54 years old, married, and had three children from this marriage, though one of them passed away several years ago. The other two are now adults, and one of her daughters still lives with her.  Her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago she learned dressmaking, an occupation which currently supports her. She has a small sewing shop in her home, where she makes a wide array of clothing items.  She sews both men and women's clothing, and she is currently very busy sewing school uniforms, since it is almost time to sign up for classes and the children and teenagers need their uniforms. She has been doing this daily for over 15 years, and she has hardly ever lacked for work. She gets help from her daughter. On weekends she sells barbecued chicken also from home, which brings in some extra income.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing materials to make her clothes.  She has been with the communal bank for three loan cycles and she appreciates the help she gets through the loans.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a workshop with better machines and more operators.\t\r\n\r\nThe two small pictures are of two members who could not be present when the group photo was taken."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3525,"image":{"id":1060924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fabric, thread, buttons, and other sewing material.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-12T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-12T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":3525,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Lucciola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mercedes Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nelly Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3520,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2012-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":880,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":881.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646331,"comment":null},{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":880,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":881.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321410,"comment":null},{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":880,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":881.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209007,"comment":null},{"amount":881.25,"local_amount":880,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:34Z","rounded_local_amount":881.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335322,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-13T21:11:50Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":412203,"name":"Teap's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teap, 30, is a leader of a group with two members.

muy luchador. Don Pedro y su esposa hace alg\u00fan tiempo se dedicaban a vender abarroter\u00eda en general, a trav\u00e9s del tiempo su negocio iba decayendo ya que ten\u00edan mucha competencia por lo que decidi\u00f3 en poner una peque\u00f1a librer\u00eda que poco a poco ha incrementado su clientela y por lo tanto sus ventas. El pr\u00e9stamo que solicita don Pedro lo necesita para la  compra de libretas, cuadernos \u00fanicos, l\u00e1pices, borradores, reglas, colores, marcadores, etc. Una de las dificultades de don Pedro ha sido la falta de dinero para invertirlo en la compra de producto para poder surtir su librer\u00eda con los materiales necesarios y que pueda tener mayor variedad, para que sus clientes siempre encuentren lo que necesiten. El est\u00e1 seguro que con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo sus ventas aumentaran y por lo tanto sus ingresos tambi\u00e9n. Su sue\u00f1o es hacer crecer su negocio y tenerlo mejor surtido. Ha tenido cinco ciclos con FAMA y no ha tenido problemas de mora, ya que ahorra a diario para pagar la cuota puntualmente.","en":"Pedro is 55 years old, is married and has six children.  He\u2019s a person of limited means but is also a very hard worker.  Pedro and his wife have been selling general groceries for some time.  Over time their business began going under, due to all the competition, so he decided to open a small bookstore.  The number of customers, and therefore sales, have been growing little by little.  Pedro needs this loan to buy pads of paper, notebooks, pencils, erasers, rulers, crayons, markers, etc.  One of Pedro\u2019s challenges has been the lack of capital to invest and stock his store with the necessary materials to have a large variety so that his customers will always find what they need.  He\u2019s certain that with the support of this loan, his sales will increase.  His dream is to grow his business and have it better stocked.  He has had five cycles with FAMA and has not had any problems with default, since he saves up money to make his payments on

He once wanted to become a teacher, since he has always seen himself as having a talent for teaching but, unfortunately, he was not able to realize this dream because his parents did not have the money to pay for his studies. \r\n\r\nRufino has confronted many challenges and has gradually excelled. Consequently through a great deal of hard work he was able to accumulate enough money to open his store in a rented space. There he sells clothing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rufino needs a little help in order to purchase new clothing (polo shirts, shorts, pants, etc). His customers are always asking him if he has the latest models and designs. This is the main reason that he wants to grow as a small businessman: he knows that if he has more inventory, his income will improve. He also wants to be able to open a new clothing venue but this time he wants to own the shop. Thus he will not have to pay rent and can save money so that he can gradually turn his great dream into reality. His dream is to own a national chain of clothing stores. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1061474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase clothing (polo shirts, shorts, pants, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tingui\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-04-13T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-13T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufino Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":164.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":168.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":175.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":187.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":196.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":201.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":411166,"name":"Ivan Edwin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Iv\u00e1n  tiene 33 a\u00f1os y no es casado pero convive con su pareja con la cual tiene 3 hijos que son de las edades de  14, 10 y 8 a\u00f1os, se dedica a la  venta de ropa interior de manera ambulante en distintas zonas de la ciudad de Cochabamba este pr\u00e9stamo su segunda secuencia dentro de la instituci\u00f3n, El Sr. Iv\u00e1n utilizara este pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mercader\u00eda ropa interior por mayor para  su negocio, El Sr. Iv\u00e1n  enfrenta retos en su negocio que son competencia y  utilizara los beneficios para mejorar su calidad de vida, su deseo para su negocio  es poder comprar un  puesto fijo, se siente muy agradecido por la oportunidad que le brindan ya que esta es su \u00fanica actividad para sacar a su familia adelante.\t","en":"Iv\u00e1n is 33 years old, single, but lives with his partner with whom he has 3 children who are the ages of 14, 10, and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nHe works selling underwear as a traveling salesman in different areas of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan sequence with the institution.

This is why, despite having her bookstore, she also works caring for a little girl from Monday through Friday in the morning.  She has a lot of patience with children and so they trust her.  She believes that it is going well for her in her business because she is very friendly and patient, and especially because she is thankful to God for allowing her to have a job and for being able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nBlanca is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because, thanks to the help they have given her, she will be able to buy more supplies for her bookstore business, especially notebooks, folders, paper, and pens, among others.

Shuhrat's profession is in high demand in his village; he is a welder and makes metal goods to-order and for sale.  He used his savings to buy several heads of small livestock a few years ago and has been consistently taking this livestock to a pasture since then and using this income to add to the family's budget.

","en":"Mirzojon is a 51 year-old man, who has a higher medical education.  He is a father of four children, works at the district hospital as a therapist.  He has many patients because he is in high demand in the villages due to the fact that there are not many such professionals there.  The family's additional income comes from fattening up goats and sheep that Mirzojon keeps at home.

She began working by doing sales from her own house via catalogues for an undergarments and sleepwear company. After traveling from house to house and gathering a particular group of customers, she formed her own group of salespeople and started to make a profit from their sales. She then applied to Maya with the group she formed from her salespeople and took out a loan, which expanded her sales by bringing in more products. As a result, Bet\u00fcl,expanded her own business, and the group members were able to better support their families. Now Bet\u00fcl has realized another of her dreams, thanks to Maya. After noticing that there was no sewing-supply store in her neighborhood, she opened one of her own, not wanting to miss this opportunity.
