Her partner Riter is 42, and they have been together for 27 years. They have two children, ages 16 and 20.  She was able to buy her own house three years ago, buying it with the money she and her partner saved up over years, as previously they lived in a rented house.\r\n\r\nHer business is river transportation, carrying people or merchandise to the populated centers located on the banks of the rivers. She contracts with the merchants who will ship their products to those places, and in the case of transporting people, she only has to post a notice about her schedule and route. \r\n\r\nShe has been working for eight years in this business and it is going well. Over all this time, she has been able to obtain three large boats, and wishes to have a fleet of ten. \r\n\r\nShe carries on her work with the help of her partner and her children.

They live in their own home that they purchased after many years of saving.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer business involves selling wood.  She buys her inventory from a sawmill and transports it using a van that she owns.  This enables her to save the shipping costs that would have been charged if she were to have the wood delivered.  Emiliana operates her business out of her home, along with her husband and one other person who helps them.  Her main customers are carpenters from the area.  She started this business more than three years ago using her own capital.  Emiliana bought a small quantity of wood and purchased more when she saw the demand increase.  Prior to starting her business, she was facing financial difficulties.  Her expenses increased after she had her son.  She wants to provide him with a better quality of life and a good education.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her 14th loan with the MFP organization, which will give her the support she needs to continue meeting her goals.  Emiliana enjoys working with her Communal Bank because the members help one another with advancing their businesses.  The amount of 3,500 PEN that she requested will be invested in the purchase of a large quantity of wood so that she will have available inventory to sell since prices are increasing.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":1123012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy more wood to sell.

She is a nice and very responsible woman.  She has a 2-year-old boy who she is raising, offering him a lot of love and protection.  She lives in her own house alongside her two sisters who she has welcomed in her home.\r\n\r\nMary's business is making clothes.  She has a workshop in her home and has been in this line of work for 15 years.  She learned everything she knows from working since she was young for a lady who was in this business.  Gradually, and with a lot of patience, she learned sewing techniques and decided to start working for herself in order to make her own income.  Over the years that she has been in this business, she has always looked for the best way of doing her work because sometimes the pressure from her customers has made her believe that she will not be able to finish her work efficiently.  However, she has faced her problems and now she has plans to expand her business.

Mildren started out in business thirteen years ago, selling candy twists and clothing.  As she started gaining more customers, she decided to apply for a loan so that she could set up a small street stall selling candies.  Her business continued to grow and she set up a grocery store.  Her work hours are from 5.00am to 10.00pm.  She works together with one of her daughters who runs the business.\r\n\r\nMildren is requesting this loan to invest in buying soft drinks, rice, sugar, milk, candies, firewood, etc.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business with the products her customers are asking for.  Her goal is to set up a supermarket in her home and her dream is for her business to grow so that she can help her husband with the household expenses and their children's school expenses.  This is the first loan that Mildren has requested from FAMA and she expects to make her repayments on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1124277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy groceries and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-06T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-05T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mildren Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mevis Sarahi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":4666.68,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4763.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551475,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":9333.32,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9527.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377745,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-18T01:55:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":444907,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is a thirty-nine-year-old married man with four children living in Kasese, Uganda.

He lives with his family in his parents\u2019 house because he has not had enough income to buy his own.  His wife, Kety, is a housewife, and she takes care of the children.  Mateo is four years old, and he goes to pre-school, and 13 year old Melani is in high school.\r\n\r\nManuel started his business when he was left without work.  The company where he worked had a reduction in personnel.  He looked for another way to get income because his family depends upon him.  He has this business, and so far it is going very well for him.  He has had the business for three years and three months, and he takes care of it by himself.  He gets up at two in the morning to prepare, with his wife, the dish.  \r\n\r\nThe \u201cencebollado\u201d is a typical Ecuadorian dish.  To prepare it you use cooked, chopped fish, white onions, herbs, chilies, and liquefied tomato.  When the yucca is ready you need to take it and start cooking the dressed fish.  Brown the red onion with the limes.  Place the yucca cut in little squares on the serving dish.  Then add the cooked fish cut in strips, hot spices, olive oil, and the fish stock.  Stir it all together.  Serve hot with corn nuts, fried banana chips, and lime slices.  The dish costs between $1.25 and $1.50 with a soft drink.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to buy tables, chairs, and ingredients for the encebollados.

So she took matters into her own hands and started a business that filled a void in the Austin market: offering high-end, quality fabrics from around the world at affordable prices. \r\n\r\n\"I never really wanted to be an entrepreneur,\" April said. \"I just wanted a store like this to open in town and I knew no one else would do it.\" She then opened The Fabricker, where she offers inventory from a variety of vendors who purchase their fabric from both famous and lesser-known local designers. \r\n\r\nThis is not how she originally envisioned her new entrepreneurial career, however. \r\n\r\nWith the encouragement of a friend who had launched a successful business with an Accion Texas Inc. loan, she applied and was approved for her own Accion loan to create an at-home business where she would sell fabric \u2013 while still working full time. Then she got laid off. Combining the Accion loan with her severance package allowed her to follow her dream and open the store. \r\n\r\nApril was always entrepreneurial, however. Before losing her job, she sold fabric at craft shows and out of her home, gaining a loyal clientele. She always managed to find excellent fabric from around the world because when her husband's job sends him out of the U.S., she sends him with a fabric budget. \r\n\r\nShe chooses fabric first by its look, then feel. \"If it's nice to the touch, if it's something I can see myself wearing, I'll buy it. But if I look at it and the print is nice, but cheaply made, I don't get it,\" she said. \r\n\r\nApril recently took out a second Accion loan. It is being used to purchase new inventory and market her business with a new outdoor sign above the entrance to the store and ads in neighborhood newsletters. \r\n\r\nThough she currently works alone, April plans to eventually hire employees. \"Being my own boss is probably the hardest job ever, and I have kids,\" April said.\" There's no one to give you answers. You need a mentor. It can be very lonely and scary, but luckily, many people have reached out to help me,\" she said. \r\n\r\nFind out more about her store and view her fabrics on her Tumbler and Facebook pages at:

Tony was preparing to open his massage therapy business in Caruthersville, Missouri, a town of 7,500, he received lots of negative feedback. Several people said he'd fail. But he has proven the naysayers wrong, celebrating his fourth anniversary this year. \r\n\r\nBefore starting Caring Caress & Massage Wellness LLC, Tony, 47, worked many jobs and gained extensive experience in marketing and health care. Being an entrepreneur was always one of his dreams, so when he decided he wanted both a career change and to become his own boss, he chose the growing field of massage therapy, eventually earning his certification from High-Tech Institute, which is now Anthem College in Memphis, Tenn. \r\n\r\nCaring Caress & Massage Wellness LLC offers foot and deep tissue massages, colon hydrotherapy, and creates client information brochures on the benefits of massage therapy. Tony's business also works with the American Cancer Society by donating money and volunteering in the Relay for Life to raise cancer research funds. \r\n\r\nHe is currently the only massage therapist in his studio, but he plans to hire another to assist him and expand the business. He presently employs a licensed colon hydrotherapist and a person who does manicures and pedicures. And he wants to eventually hire a chiropractor. \r\n\r\nEarly in his new career as an entrepreneur, Tony attended a seminar where he found out about Accion Texas. He kept up with Accion via emails, and when he found about the grand opening of an office in his area, he decided to apply for a loan. He was approved and the loan proceeds will allow him to buy equipment and supplies, such as the Steamy Wonder TM. This product is essentially a portable sauna and helps clients detoxify and lose weight without body wraps. Tony also plans to purchase and sell a line of home-use wellness products in his studio. \r\n\r\nAlways eager to increase his knowledge and help people, Tony is an active member of the American Massage Therapy Association. Through this affiliation, he receives liability insurance that covers him anywhere he works, and receives discounted rates on educational classes and new products. \"They do a ton of research and share that with us,\" Tony said. \"And clients have found me through the organization's website. I wouldn't want to be without them.\" \r\n\r\nTony also works health fairs, gives chair massages in offices, sells gift certificates and passes out marketing fliers \u2013 all with an eye toward growing his clientele and expanding his business. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about Tony's company and services, visit the following sites: http:\/\/www.caringcaressmassageandwellness.com and

","en":"Adonastien is a young single man - 29 years old and without children. He has been a trader in the suburbs for one year, where he runs a bar selling soft drinks. Thanks to his strong management skills, he has been able to develop a considerable customer base in such a short space of time. \r\nHowever, as the beer brand \"33 Export\" is the most popular in his area, he often has a supply problem as his stock of \"33 Export\" is barely enough to meet the demand from his ever growing customer base - meaning he risks losing considerable numbers of customers in the short term.\r\nHe is seeking this loan therefore in order to be able to increase his stock of \"33 Export\", which will allow him to win this market in the face of his competition - thereby to grow his sales and, as a result, his profits.\r\nThese profits will allow him on the one hand to invest in his business, and diversify into selling wine, and on the other hand to cover his own expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1134248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cases of

They live together in their own house, which they managed to build together after putting out a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nShe makes and sells a variety of sweets which she prepares at home in a wood-fired brick oven. She then delivers them, according to her orders, to the corner stores and grocery stores in her area and in other riverside communities outside the city. She has been working this way for more than two years. Her children help her to make and distribute the sweets. This way they manage to sell all her products and turn over her capital quickly. She enjoys what she does, especially since it keeps her busy, which is one of the reasons she decided to start her business. She also wanted to have a source of income which would allow her to help her partner cover their living expenses and educate their children.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma]. She is committed to making her loan payments on time, as she did with her previous loans.

As a source of her primary income, she has been involved in animal husbandry for 23 years, having started this business with a sum of 6,000 som.  Thanks to Tynchtykgul's hard work, today her business contains three cows with offspring and one horse, and the sales of milk yield about 15,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Tynchtykgul requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase dairy cows in order to increase her income from sales of milk and milk products.

La mayor preocupaci\u00f3n de Amalia y su esposo son los ladrones y piratas ya que roban el producto pescado, roban motores y a veces da\u00f1an las embarcaciones es por eso que su esposo al finalizar la labor con ayuda guarda su motor en casa ya que es nuevo y lo adquiri\u00f3 con mucho esfuerzo.

She learned to fish from her husband who taught her how and she does it to help him with the household economy since she did not find a job.  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning she was afraid of the waves and the dangers inherent in this profession but as time went by she became accustomed to it.  She likes the fresh air and she does not get seasick.  \r\n\r\nThey work from Monday through Saturday from 5am until 11am and then take their catches to be sold.  They only work these days because that\u2019s when small vendors buy the most and they use Sundays to repair their nets.  \r\n\r\nAmalia\u2019s and her husband\u2019s greatest concern is robbers and pirates that steal the catches of fish, they steal motors and sometimes damage the boats which is why when her husband finishes the day\u2019s work he gets help to store his motor at home because it\u2019s new and he put in a lot of effort to acquire it.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been fishing for 13 years and feels that she\u2019s finally getting good results because she\u2019s been able to fix up her house and to buy a new motor for the boat making it more comfortable.

They have six children, two of whom are independent and living away from their parents.  The other four children live with their parents in the Daniel Hernandez neighborhood, in a house that they own.  \r\n\r\nJuana decided to open a grocery 4 years ago.  She operates the business in a space in her house.  She sells bread--hot from the oven--drinks, vegetables and--just recently--hanks of wool.  Many of Juana's neighbors like to knit and now they can buy wool from her.  She has managed to grow the business, bit by bit, and says that her goal is to expand because she \"hasn't yet been able to stock all the merchandise\" that she'd like to sell.  Even so, she is happy with the progress she's made and is planning future improvements to the store.  She knows what she needs, but she doesn't have enough money to carry out her plans.  Her husband is a day laborer, doing farm work on various local farms, and all of his income goes to paying the family's expenses.  \r\n\r\nThis is Juana's 3rd MFP loan.  She is grateful for your help because past loans have allowed her to improve her business and, in turn, her income.  She knows that she has to repay this loan in the agreed-upon time to get future loans.  Juana will use this loan to stock her store with snacks, drinks and other everyday

This young, hardworking woman lives in Milagros in her parents\u2019 house since she\u2019s single.  She\u2019s liked the activity she carries out since she started going to school since she\u2019s good at sales and decided to test the market.  Before finishing secondary school she\u2019d taken several courses where she learned to care for and maintain it.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this business for seven years now and does very well.

He is IDP and lives with his family in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He breeds cows and cattle and sells milk and milk products as well as cattle for meat purposes to local butchers. He also raises sheep for meat purposes. Asaf has 10 years of experience in this field thanks to his father who taught him how to look after cattle. He receives 120 AZN financial support from government monthly, but this is too little to cover his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAsaf usually buys small cattle, raises and fattens them in 5-6 months, and resells them for a higher price in the local livestock bazaar. He sells milk and yoghurt to the neighbors. Selling milk and meat brings 280 AZN per month. Milk and yoghurt, as well as beef and mutton, are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and always use yoghurt souse.

Ngome told us he started working in this field more than a year ago because there was a need for a general store in his neighborhood. Little by little he has been able to grow this business thanks to his job.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy more general products such as rice, noodles, flour, sugar, oil and other products. Thanks to this investment, he continues to sell high quality products, consequently increasing his sales and his income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1131712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more general products such as rice, noodles, flour, sugar and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Samburu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":164,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ngome","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1111},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1113}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2336.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294475006,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301528442,"comment":null},{"amount":13.99,"local_amount":1119.45,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308510166,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":3324,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3494.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315526208,"comment":null},{"amount":12.59,"local_amount":1007.39,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323125702,"comment":null},{"amount":42.96,"local_amount":3436.61,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3612.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331272849,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T19:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3503.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339649319,"comment":null},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":2224,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T17:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2338,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347206618,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T04:14:20Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T17:03:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":445555,"name":"Amos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amos is 24 years old.

Los desaf\u00edos que enfrenta Eloisa en el negocio son porque cada d\u00eda los precios de la canasta b\u00e1sica es m\u00e1s cara y las personas casi no compran como antes. El negocio cambiara con el pr\u00e9stamo ya que tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s variedad de productos y as\u00ed vender\u00e1 m\u00e1s. Las metas de Eloisa es poder sacar a sus hijos adelante, ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar,  que un d\u00eda su negocio sea mas grande y productivo y tener una mejor calidad de vida. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito que solicita en FAMA y espera cumplir puntualmente con el pago de sus cuotas.","en":"Eloisa is a member of the group of entrepreneurs known as Women of Courage. She is 31 years old and  married with 3 children. Her husband works as a bricklayer. Her business started in 2010 when she won the lottery and decided to invest all of her winnings in the launch of her own business, a small convenience store. She opens the store at 7:00 AM and closes it at 8:00 PM. The advantage she has in her business is that there are no nearby businesses; she has little competition. Eloisa is requesting this loan in order to invest it in the purchase of products such as lard, sausages, chicken, soft drinks, sugar, beans and rice, among other products. The challenges Eloisa faces result from the fact that people are buying less these days, due to the rising price of basic groceries. The business will change with this loan since she will be able to offer a wider variety of products and will be able to sell more as a result. Her goals are to be able to help her children move ahead, to help her husband with the household expenses, to grow her business so that it is larger and more productive, and to improve her quality of life. This is the first loan that Eloisa has requested from Kiva\u2019s partner FAMA. She expects to punctually make the payments on her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1127679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy basic grocery products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tocoa, Colon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.683333 -86","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2012-07-07T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-06T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suyapa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloisa Yamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5250},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5366.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551479,"comment":null},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":10500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10732.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301377750,"comment":null},{"amount":281.25,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5366.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-16T17:47:56Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":445557,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a 27-year-old married Lebanese woman.

He is the second child of five and at 20 years of age he began to work for himself. He began as a laborer and got a lot of experience in this line of work but it was not sufficient because he had greater economic needs. After that, he began as an assistant on a bus and after some months earned the job of driving the bus. Because of his good driving he won the owner's confidence and became after a year and a half the driver of this bus. In this way, his income improved considerably.\r\n\r\nShortly after, he met who is now his wife because she used to take this bus. They now have been married twelve years. According to his own statements, he is happy and they live a full life, saying that if God allows them to have a baby his happiness will be even greater. \r\n\r\nThey are both excellent and very responsible people. Currently he is requesting a loan to buy two milk cows in order to take advantage of the pasture that his land has. The investment will be utilized to make a productive source for his family and at the same time to generate more income. What he hopes is to improve his economic situation and to feel satisfied that the institution trusts him with the money because of his ability to pay back. Among his goals is to leave his job as a driver and make a living working with cattle and pigs because this is light and profitable work.

She began her business two years ago with the sale of clothing which helped her get enough money to begin raising chickens and pigs. Mayra likes animals a lot and it was for this reason that she moved from the clothing business to dedicate herself completely to raising of animals. She realized that it gave her better results although it requires more patience. \r\n\r\nBecause the house where she lives is her own and she has a lot of space for a suitable pen for her animals. She is also far from the city, so she does not bother her neighbors with the noise. The caring, cleaning and feeding of these animals is done by herself everyday. She goes out only two days a week to sell her products until finished. She does her work in this way because she is far from the city and the transfer demands her money and time. The sale price of her products are $1.40 per pound of chicken and $2.80 per pound of pork. She has many customers because her animals are local and fresh, which is most appreciated about her meats. \r\n\r\nMayra has not had  major difficulties and hopes to continue this way because she is a single mother and the only means of support for her family. She has three children of 6, 10 and 3 years of age. Two of her children study in public schools and the youngest is her assistant. With the loan that she is requesting, she will buy chickens and pigs to raise. Her dream is to have many animals to raise and sell. She would also like to equip the areas where the animals are located to improve the cleanliness and to raise higher quality products, hoping to continue helping her children in their studies.

Her house, like many in her neighborhood, receives water and electricity services but is still waiting for surfacing and drains.  Sixteen years ago, Vicenta decided to open a grocery store because there wasn't one in her neighborhood and she saw an opportunity to earn money.  She now has competition but things are going well because, over time, she has gained customers and she knows how to serve the public.  She opens from 7.00am to 7.00pm.  She does not stay any later because her neighborhood is dangerous and there is a lot of crime at night.  The products that she sells most of are rice, sugar, oil, cookies, etc.  She buys these every week in order to stock her store.  Vicenta runs her store and serves her customers alone although her 12-year-old son sometimes helps her.  She will use her loan to buy merchandise.  She hopes to improve her sales so that she can continue supporting her son with his education.  Her future dream is to buy a vehicle with which to transport her purchases so that she can save on
