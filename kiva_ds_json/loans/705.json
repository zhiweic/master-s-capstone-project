He is a very hardworking and enterprising man. He lives in his parents' house, along with his two younger siblings, who he loves and wants to help with their education. Wilmer sells plantains wholesale. Every morning he arises very early to get to Puerto Numero 1, also called Malec\u00f3n Grau, where he awaits the arrival of the producers. He buys the plantains at a good price, and then sells them at higher prices. He has been doing this for three years, and so far he has done it by himself, occasionally hiring workers to help him carry the produce. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes about his work is that it allows him to have a modest income, thanks to which he can help with the family expenses. This will be his first loan with MFP, and he is very happy for the opportunity to have a line of credit and working capital. Therefore he promises to be punctual in his payments so he will be eligible for more loans in the future. With the requested loan he will purchase plantains.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":908401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more plantains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-31T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.77},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":110.23},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":120.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":128.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.36,"local_amount":105.29,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":111.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621895,"comment":null},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":110.77,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":117.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835970,"comment":null},{"amount":43.31,"local_amount":110.23,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":117.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245728,"comment":null},{"amount":47.15,"local_amount":120.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385764,"comment":null},{"amount":49.14,"local_amount":125.08,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":132.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098856,"comment":null},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":128.59,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":136.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712985,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

This is a region on the border with Honduras and is known as El Salvador\u2019s poorest.  He is the father of three boys and has been married for 21 years.  His main income producing activity is corn and bean farming.\r\n\r\nTen years ago Jos\u00e9 started a small chicken farm to produce eggs which did very well during the winter but when the dry season came he was unable to keep the farm running because his community lacked running water service and the nearest water source was an hour away from his house.  Today, Jos\u00e9 wants to restart his small chicken farm to produce eggs because his community recently was benefited with the installation of potable water service.  He has therefore asked Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy 50 chickens, 800 pounds of concentrated feed and 3 liters of medicine to keep his farm in hygienic conditions.  All of the supplies including the chickens he\u2019ll buy in a city that\u2019s two hours away from home by bus.  The sale of any eggs produced in his farm is guaranteed: it will be in his own community because there are no external vendors because of the distance to the nearest city and its difficult access. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Jos\u00e9 projects that his daily income will increase by 3 dollars which will allow him to make his loan installment payments and generate a small profit margin to continue

She has a clothing workshop in her neighborhood where she mostly makes women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes of all prices. To do this, she has equipment and basic machines that aid in the smooth operation of her small business. Her clients are mainly neighbors in the area where she lives and in the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Her clients find her final products to be excellent, and this keeps them returning to Ledys.  She has a lot of experience in business.

Currently she is getting ready to increase her sales in the November and December, times in which sales are usually high.

She and her daughter live in their own home in the district of Tarma.  Because she has large tracts of land, Hermelinda works in agriculture.  She plants a variety of products including potatoes, olluco (another tuber), broad beans, oats, alfalfa, etc.  \"It's useful to plant everything.  Potatoes, for example, are harvested once a year and sell well, while alfalfa, olluco and broad beans feed me for the other months,\" she explains.  At the same time, with the alfalfa that she plants, she feeds her cows and guinea pigs.  \r\n\r\nIn her neighborhood, besides selling the milk that her cows produce, she also offers firewood by weight which she sells in bulk.  In this way, she earns income in various manners.  She comments that the production of her fields is due to the good investment she makes in the purchase of fertilizers.  Many times she has had to confront the \"worms\" (a plague that eats through potatoes and other tubers) because she has not purchased the necessary insecticides and fertilizers.  In her work she receives help from outside laborers, who she pays daily.  Hermelinda hopes to provide a good education for her young Anaid, and for that reason she continues working as much or more now.  With your help, Hermelinda will be able to access her first loan from Kiva partner MFP, and for that reason she communicates firmly that she will be punctual in the payment of her debts.  With the money from the loan, this selfless mother will be able to improve her quality of life, creating a cement floor for her rustic house, and investing 1500 Peruvian soles in that endeavor.

Su casa es grande, ah\u00ed viven su hija, esposo y nietos; y como un ambiente grande de la casa estaba libre, Zoila lo alquila a otra familia, obteniendo un ingreso considerable mensual.\nPor recomendaci\u00f3n de Judith, su hija, hace 3 meses, tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio que consiste en la venta de joyas y perfumes por cat\u00e1logo. \u201cSi es rentable pero cuando invierto m\u00e1s, m\u00e1s gano, hay d\u00edas en que tengo que pagar con mi dinero\u201d, explica aduciendo que la falta de capital ha sido su principal inconveniente, hasta ahora.\nCon el tiempo, Zoila y su hija piensan tener un negocio propio, han considerado abrir una tienda de art\u00edculos de limpieza, en la que ofrecer\u00e1n pa\u00f1ales, toallas, detergentes, jabones, etc.; lo que lograr\u00e1n gracias a su trabajo coordinado y constante, as\u00ed como a los ahorros producto de su negocio y alquiler.

She has four children, only one of whom lives with her. Zolia lives in her own home, which is large; her daughter (Judith, age 32), son-in-law, and two grandchildren live with her. They live in Tarma. She rents part of her home to another family; she has enough space to do so, and this provides her with a considerable monthly income. In spite of her age, Zolia takes care of an elderly 75-year-old woman.\r\nOn the advice of her daughter Judith, Zolia started her own business three months ago. She has a small business selling jewellery and perfume through a catalogue. \"Yes, it is profitable, but when I invest more I earn more. Some days I have to pay with my own money [first]\", she says, telling us that a lack of capital has been her main challenge up until now.\r\nWith time, Zoila and her daughter are thinking of having their own business. They have considered opening a cleaning supply store, where they would offer diapers, towels, detergents, soaps, etc. They are sure to achieve this goal thanks to their constant, coordinated hard work, and to the earnings from Zoila's current business and from the rent of their rooms. \r\nWith your help, Zoila will take out her first loan with MFP; so she promises to be punctual with her repayments. Zoila is very enthusiastic. With the money from the loan that she hopes to take out, she will buy beauty products such as jewellery, perfume, cream, facial products, etc. for the Christmas and New Year's season; this is when her products are in the greatest demand."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":908590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy jewellery, perfumes and creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":103.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":105.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":110.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":112.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":118.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":126.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":130.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":135.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":140.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":145.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":149}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.52,"local_amount":103.09,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":106.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621904,"comment":null},{"amount":15.74,"local_amount":41.06,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":42.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835979,"comment":null},{"amount":68.25,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":184.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245737,"comment":null},{"amount":41.9,"local_amount":109.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":113.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712995,"comment":null},{"amount":45.36,"local_amount":118.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":122.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189126,"comment":null},{"amount":12.94,"local_amount":33.75,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-18T12:00:14Z","rounded_local_amount":34.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573331,"comment":null},{"amount":351.29,"local_amount":916.42,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":949.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869193,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T08:02:26Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T11:40:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353266,"name":"Raida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Raida de 55 a\u00f1os de edad es una mujer casada, vive en un hogar propio en la misma ciudad de Tarma.

Say is the resident of Prey Chhor district, Kompong Cham province. She lives in a common law relationship with her husband and has given birth to 3 children, all of whom are young, and not enrolled in school yet. Say has been cultivating rice crops for her livelihood for ages. This business earns her around $2.00 each day but it seems barely enough to cover her daily expenses. Say\u2019s husband usually helps her to grow rice during the rainy season and also takes some time to operate his own business as well. He has a skill of making a type of ice creams, so every day he rides his bike to sell his products only to the people in the local community. Say wants her husband to deliver his products to the people in other areas, so as to have a good chance to create more profit. Anyway, using a bicycle is not a good transportation method to reach this goal. Therefore, Say is taking out a loan form Kiva through HKL to support her husband\u2019s business. This loan will be used to purchase a second-hand motorcycle. In the future, she hopes to expand the business of her husband and support all her children to enroll in the local

Tath, 61, is in the business of selling Khmer traditional cake in her province, Kompong Chhnang, and is a mother of four children. Some of her children are working and living separately because of their job or business. Her oldest daughter owns a store and sells mixed products, which can make a good profit, in a local market in Pursat province. And another one works as a garment factory worker in Phnom Penh city. They are cooperating well in earning income for the family. Though all of them are living far away from home, they always get in touch with their mother. \r\n\r\nPresently Tath\u2019s daughter has run out of stock of her products for sale.

is a 33-year-old lady married to Saul, a 35-year-old man. Maria and Saul adopted a little girl named Marsella from her relatives. Marsella, who is 10, is studying at the 3rd grade in Elementary School. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet their family needs, Maria\u2019s husband runs an electronics (e.g. television, radio, tape recorder etc) repair shop business. As the income generated from the business is unstable, Maria took the initiative to sell gasoline in front of her house to support her husband in meeting their family needs. She has been running the business for almost five years. \r\n\r\nMaria intends to add more gasoline for her business after she saw the opportunity to serve people who do not have time to stand in line at the gasoline station, particularly in the morning when they should go to work and school. It would allow her business product to be sold out quickly. \r\n\r\nThis situation led her to seek a loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She plans to purchase more gasoline to sell. She hopes that TLM will assist her in improving her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Thorn and her husband are rice cultivators. This couple is living with their 4 single children in Phnom Penh city. Agriculture is her sole income. Together, they generate an average of 2.50 USD each day to support the family. One of her daughters also helps in earning income by working as a garment factory worker and she gets her monthly salary the same as other workers. \n\nWith the 250 USD loan she has applied for from Kiva, Mrs.Thorn will be able to pay for laborers working in her rice field.

is a 35-year-old, married woman who has three sons and three daughters.  Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee who earns a decent salary. \r\n\r\nMansoura has a hatcheries project that she wants to expand by purchasing more hatcheries.  However, she does not have enough money for this purchase and is requesting a loan from Kiva partner FATEN.  When Mansoura receives the loan, she will be able to purchase more hatcheries, which will will increase her sales and improve her income.  Mansoura is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead of her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Patrick will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Apokori group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nHe is pictured with his group members in the picture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":908832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hudson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":113750,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":113750,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":114425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T14:52:43Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353414,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice is 37 years old.

She used to live in her parents' house in the municipality of San Jacinto. Before she used to sew with her sisters and also take care of children in a community house, endorsed by the national government. Through her own effort and supported by the state, she has managed to get ahead and now has her own house and a new business that supports her in generating revenue and seeking a better lifestyle for her family daily. In addition to sewing clothes, she sells soft drinks, sodas, beers which shopkeepers and other businesses buy icecold to sell. Also as she knows how to bake, she also sells desserts at special times commisioned by neighbours and people they know and recommend. So when you speak with her she is filled with enthusiasm because she says she lacks for nothing and this is thanks to her judicious and orderly work and above all to her family who she appreciates for never having abandoned her. \r\n\r\nHer dream of growth is often cut short because her capital is insufficient to meet clients' needs. This is why she has come for funding to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, the first loan with Kiva and with which she will buy soft drinks in large quantities to reduce costs and be provisoned for December when her sales rally. Likewise she will buy a cooler as the fridge where she cools the soft drinks is insufficient to meet the great demand and fabric to fill a few orders for children's clothing.\r\n\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":909013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fabrics, soft drinks and a cooler.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T09:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54805},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59817},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":61213},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62641},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64103},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65599},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":67129},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68695},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70298},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71939},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73617},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80144}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.83,"local_amount":54805,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":57586.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780307,"comment":null},{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":59817,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":62852.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188692,"comment":null},{"amount":34.44,"local_amount":61213,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":64319.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324905,"comment":null},{"amount":35.23,"local_amount":62641,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":65820.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038962,"comment":null},{"amount":36.06,"local_amount":64103,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67356.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651113,"comment":null},{"amount":36.9,"local_amount":65599,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68928.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386662,"comment":null},{"amount":97.16,"local_amount":172729,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":181495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130898,"comment":null},{"amount":145.74,"local_amount":259093,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":272241.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071768,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T21:01:38Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353476,"name":"Wilmer Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilmer Jos\u00e9 se dedica a la venta de mercader\u00eda en general.

family and two sons, who are seven and five years old, in the the Oi-Tal village (north-eastern part of Kyrgyzstan).  In search of a source of income, Akylbek started his own business of breeding livestock, growing and reselling agricultural crops in 1996.  Akylbek has apple and pear trees on his plot of land and also devotes special attention to cultivating and growing a particular variety of potatoes that is in higher demand among the local residents.

daughter.  Djumabay was born in 1969 into a simple farmer's family.  His father had a small farm, and since childhood, Djumabay helped his father with caring for the livestock and dreamed of having his own farm in the future.  In 1988, after finishing school, Djumabay went to serve in the army.  Upon his return to his native village in 1990, he studied to become a driver of agricultural machinery and was hired at the local collective farm as a tractor\/combine driver.  After some time, Djumabay got married and, using his salary, gradually purchased young livestock and grew clover and cereals; thus, expanding his farm.  His daughter was born in 2002, and Djumabay was able to buy his own house for his family in 2003.  Currently, thanks to Djumabay's persistence, his farm contains 3 dairy cows and 22 heads of sheep.  In order to further develop his business, Djumabay requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for the purchase of bulls for fattening up.  In the future, Djumabay plans to increase livestock headcount and dreams of buying an off-road vehicle.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. In 2012, the members of Nabangala A group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nNB: Rachael Nabangala is funded in Nabangala B group; thus, this reduces the number in this group to three people."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":895123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-08T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":24150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":24875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-09T05:05:57Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353572,"name":"Benedicta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedicta is 40 years old, a widow with five children; Raphael, Kelvin, Irene, Sharon and Japheth.\r\n\r\nShe owns a retail shop and has been in the business for the past two years.

She is in the photograph with her group members. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\r\n\r\nJanet takes care of six children at home. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Janet had an excellent maize yield harvesting 12 bags on 1\/2 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Janet was only able to harvest 1 bag of maize on 1\/2 acre of land.

Besides, the prices are accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to give her family a better quality of life, the reason she doesn't stop working, since her family is everything to her.\r\n\r\nThis has motivated her to request this loan from Integral to invest in her business by buying an appropriate table for making cheese, since at the moment she doesn't have a place that allows her to speed up production.  She also needs the loan to buy the necessary materials (containers, molds, rennet tablets, pieces of cloth, etc.) to make cheese, cream, cottage cheese, etc.\r\n\r\nThe goal of all this is to improve her customer service, since this way she will be able to keep her business productive for much longer and she will be able to continue fighting for her dream.

He has dependents and he is the only income earner in the family.\r\n\r\nFor two years he has been running a business of house renting and this has facilitated him in providing for his family.
