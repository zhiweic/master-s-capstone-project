Para llegar al lugar de reuni\u00f3n se tiene que recorrer un largo camino a pie ya que no entra el trasporte hasta ese lugar. El nombre del grupo se eligi\u00f3 hace tiempo, las integrantes lo adaptaron porque algunas de ellas ya estaban una asociaci\u00f3n anterior con el mismo nombre. A pesar de no conocer con exactitud porqu\u00e9 se eligi\u00f3 ese nombre en un inicio, todas piensan que es porque el lugar en donde viven hay muchos manantiales peque\u00f1os donde las personas van a traer el agua para beber o para lavar.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, un miembro del grupo, comenta que tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Fernando, quien todas las tardes se dedica a raspar el maguey para hacer el tradicional pulque. Hace mas de 30 a\u00f1os  que est\u00e1n juntos; ellos formaron una familia, pero solo 2 de sus hijos siguen viviendo con ellos y aunque ya no estudian, siguen dependiendo de dicha pareja.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda se dedica a la crianza de borregos, actividad en la cual ya tiene 30 a\u00f1os. Tambi\u00e9n tiene una tienda de abarrotes, la cual abri\u00f3 hace 20 a\u00f1os aproximadamente. Explica que la crianza de borregos la adopt\u00f3 ya que su mam\u00e1 le dio dos borreguitos que ella tuvo que cuidar, fue entonces que aprendi\u00f3 todo lo relacionado con el engocio y decidi\u00f3 iniciar la actividad. La tienda la puso posteriormente ya que sus hijos y esposo la motivaron para iniciarla y ellos mismos le ayudaron econ\u00f3micamente.\n\nEsta vez est\u00e1 solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar 5 borregos y surtir su tienda de abarrotes para la cual tiene planeado comprar productos enlatados, refrescos, golosinas, pan, huevo, leche, etc. Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 muy contenta y agradecida con el cr\u00e9dito ya que le servir\u00e1 volver a surtir su tienda (desde hace tiempo le faltaban varios productos). \n\nEn sus actividades, Mar\u00eda no tiene dificultades ya que sus borregos est\u00e1n en muy buenas condiciones y la tienda est\u00e1 mejorando poco a poco. La meta que tiene do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda es arreglar su tiendita ya que solo tiene maderas para colocar su producto y es techado, le gustar\u00eda tener su tienda colada y estantes grandes para sus productos. Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda tener m\u00e1s borregos, todo esto para que su calidad de vida mejore. Adem\u00e1s Mar\u00eda explica muy contenta que siempre invierte nuevamente sus ganancias en los negocios, pero tambi\u00e9n obtiene para los gastos del hogar y para los pagos de su cr\u00e9dito.\n\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda y el resto del grupo est\u00e1n muy contentos y agradecidos con Kiva y Vision Fund (FRAC) pues podr\u00e1n invertir en sus actividades (venta de ganado).

In order to get to their meeting place, the members must travel a long distance on foot since it is impossible for any form of transportation to reach this site.  The name of the group was chosen a long time ago.  The members adopted this name because some of them previously belonged to another group with the same name.  Even though they do not know the exact reason why they chose this name, they all believe that it is because the place where they live has many small springs where people can draw water for drinking and bathing.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, a member of the group, says that she is 51 years old and married to Sr. Fernando.  Every evening, she scrapes the leaves of the agave plant in order to make traditional \"pulque\" (a fermented beverage).  Mar\u00eda and her husband have been together for more than 30 years.  They formed a family, but only two of their children are dependents who continue to live with them even though they are no longer in school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda has been raising sheep for 30 years.  She also has a grocery store that she opened approximately 20 years ago.  Mar\u00eda explains she began raising sheep when her mother gave her two lambs to care for.  It was then that she learned everything about the business and decided to start one of her own.  The store was established later on after her children and husband convinced her to start it.  They also help out financially.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan in order to buy five heads of sheep and to restock her grocery store with canned goods, soft drinks, candies, bread, eggs, milk, and other items.  She is pleased and grateful that the loan will help to replenish the inventory of her store since she lacks various products.  In her activities, Mar\u00eda has no difficulties with her sheep since they are kept in very good conditions and her store is improving gradually.  Her goal is to remodel her store since it only has planks of wood for displaying her products and a roof.  She would like for her store to have larger shelves for storing her products.  Mar\u00eda would also like to have more sheep so that she can improve her quality of life.  Overall she is very pleased because she is always able to reinvest her earnings in her businesses.  She is also able to pay for the household expenses and cover her loan payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda and the rest of her group and very happy with and appreciative of Kiva and Vision Fund (FRAC) because they will be able to invest in their various livestock activities.

David used to live in the town of San Luis, Antioquia, but due to violence in the area he had to move to another city and begin a new life.  At first, there were very few opportunities and he did not receive support from anyone toward finding a job and earning an income for his household.  But one day he decided to set up his own business selling clothing, which is how he currently earns a living.  \r\n\r\nDavid works in the center of town and for many years kept requesting a permit to work as a street vendor.  Approximately five years ago they gave him the permit and since then he works at a fixed location which is easy for customers to find.

Se encuentra casado y tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os de quien manifiesta es su mayor motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar fuertemente todos los d\u00edas en la pesca, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su familia, pues su padre y sus hermanos mayores se han dedicado a esta actividad por un largo tiempo y desde muy temprana edad se la ense\u00f1aron, por lo que cuenta con una gran experiencia lo que le permite diferenciarse de su competencia. Gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos, Luis Fernando tiene un gran reconocimiento y esto le ha permitido que sus pedidos vengan aumentando considerablemente, y es por esto que ahora pide que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita comprar un mejor equipo de pesca, pues con el equipo que cuenta actualmente es insuficiente para poder satisfacer toda la demanda de sus productos. \nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 ser m\u00e1s eficiente en su trabajo diario y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 satisfacer los grandes pedidos que le hacen sus clientes. Adem\u00e1s, podr\u00e1 poco a poco ir cumpliendo su sue\u00f1o de brindarles a su esposa y su hijo de 2 a\u00f1os una buena calidad de vida y mejores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"\r\nLuis Fernando has always been noted for being very hardworking and this quality has allowed him to overcome great difficulties that have come up in his life and continue to make progress with his family.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s married and has a 2-year-old son who he says is his greatest motivator to work hard fishing every day, an activity he learned from his family since his father and his older brothers have been in this occupation for a long time and taught it to him at a very young age which is why he has quite a bit of experience that sets him apart from the competition.\r\n\r\nThanks to the good quality of his products, Luis Fernando is very well-known which has led to his orders increasing considerably and this is why he\u2019s now asking for a loan that will make it possible for him to buy better fishing equipment because what he has now is insufficient to be able to meet all the demand for his products.\r\n\r\nIn this way he will be able to be more efficient in his daily work and be able to fill the large orders his customers place.  In addition, he will be able to gradually reach his dream of providing his wife and two-year-old son with a good quality of life and better economic opportunities for progress.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1084145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy better fishing equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Rafael","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-06-01T15:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-01T15:00:10Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49895},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51291},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52725},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54200},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55716},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57274},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58876},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60523},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62216},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63956},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65745},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67583}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.57},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":47940,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":48104.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432462,"comment":null},{"amount":60.27,"local_amount":105467,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105828.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378491,"comment":null},{"amount":0.29,"local_amount":504,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":505.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301433139,"comment":null},{"amount":29.19,"local_amount":51080,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":51255.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617571,"comment":null},{"amount":31.8,"local_amount":55649,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":55839.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640496,"comment":null},{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":60461,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":60668.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029590,"comment":null},{"amount":31.8,"local_amount":55652,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":55842.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165692,"comment":null},{"amount":36.42,"local_amount":63747,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63965.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548228,"comment":null},{"amount":148.29,"local_amount":259500,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":260389.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347098160,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-02T09:50:47Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:47:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":421029,"name":"Luis Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Enrique se encuentra casado y tiene 2 hijos, y para generar los ingresos que se requieren en su hogar para sostener los gastos, trabaja en una finca haciendo las labores de mantenimiento de esta.

He and his family live in the community of Diamante, Campamento.  \r\n\r\nTimoteo is a coffee grower which is his only asset.  Ten years ago he bought a farm and learned from a friend who would guide him how to do the work.  His work schedule during harvest time is from 5am until 6pm.  He works with help from his wife, his children and some employees.  One of his disadvantages is that he does now own a coffee dryer which makes his work more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe loan Timoteo requests is needed to buy manure, coffee plants and to pay the employees to clear the farm.  With help from this loan he\u2019ll have income that will help him support his family and his farm will be cleared and he\u2019ll obtain a better harvest with the treatment and manure he\u2019ll apply to the coffee farm.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to have an abundant coffee harvest to become the best producer in the area.

The father of her children abandoned them a long time ago, which left her in charge of all of the household obligations.\r\n\r\nWith the motive of generating income to support the household, she took advantage of the experience she had working in a restaurant.  Approximately six years ago she decided to establish her own cafeteria, where she provides very good service to her customers.  Thanks to the great clientele that she has, a sister of hers helps her work in order to be able to provide good service in the cafeteria.\r\n\r\nThanks to this business she has managed to generate sufficient income to be able to give her three children a better quality of life and a good quality education.  She is so perseverant so that the business continues growing.  This way she continues to provide her children with good opportunities.\r\n\r\nBecause the business does not have a lot of capital, Yuri is looking for a loan to buy a refrigerator for the cafeteria.  She will also buy stock to provide her customers with a greater variety of products.\r\n\r\nThis way her business will continue to always provide good service, and, little by little, she will get more customers.  This will allow her income to increase, and she will fulfill her dream of having a great business and of getting her three children ahead.  She will be providing them with a good education and a good quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1084119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a

Desde hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os aprendi\u00f3 de una t\u00eda la actividad de la confecci\u00f3n, y desde entonces viene trabajando fuertemente en esta actividad lo que le ha permitido tener muy buena experiencia. En un principio Erika trabajaba en un taller de confecci\u00f3n donde perfeccion\u00f3 su trabajo y as\u00ed mont\u00f3 su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n donde ofrec\u00eda el servicio de confecci\u00f3n a terceros; luego, gracias a la buena calidad de sus productos logr\u00f3 tener muy buenas ventas y as\u00ed poder tener el capital suficiente con el cual mont\u00f3 su l\u00ednea propia de prendas de vestir. Actualmente, Erika trabaja \u00fanicamente su l\u00ednea propia gracias a que tiene muy buenas ventas y su capacidad de producci\u00f3n se encuentra totalmente dirigida a la confecci\u00f3n de los pedidos de su l\u00ednea propia; sin embargo, cuenta con la dificultad de que no ha tenido el capital suficiente con el cual pueda comprar una m\u00e1quina resortadora, por lo que le toca dirigirse hasta otro barrio de la ciudad donde le prestan este servicio y as\u00ed debe incurrir en gastos extras en su producci\u00f3n. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta situaci\u00f3n, Erika busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina resortadora y as\u00ed poder tener todo lo necesario para la producci\u00f3n de sus prendas de vestir y no tener que incurrir en gastos extras en su producci\u00f3n.\nDe esta manera Erika podr\u00e1 ahorrar una gran cantidad de dinero en desplazamiento y en pagar por el servicio que le prestan con la m\u00e1quina resortadora, por lo que sus ingresos mensuales se ver\u00e1n en aumento y as\u00ed su negocio seguir\u00e1 saliendo adelante. Erika sue\u00f1a con tener un gran taller donde pueda generar empleo para m\u00e1s personas y as\u00ed cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser una gran empresaria, para lo cual ha trabajado fuertemente. \n","en":"\r\nErika, 20, is a young entrepreneur who decided to open her own business aimed at generating her own income to be able to contribute economically to her household\u2019s expenses.  \r\n\r\nAbout five years ago she learned dressmaking from an aunt and since then has been working hard at this activity leading to her having very good experience.  At the beginning, Erika worked at a dressmaking shop where she honed her skills and then set up her own shop where she\u2019d sew for third parties.  \r\n\r\nLater, thanks to the good quality of her products she managed to have very good sales and gather enough capital to start her own line of clothes.  Currently, Erika works exclusively in her own line because she has good sales and her production capacity is totally directed to filling orders of her own line.  However, she has the difficulty that she\u2019s not had sufficient capital to buy a double stitch machine which means she has to go to a different neighborhood in the city where she can avail herself of this service thus incurring extra production costs.\r\n\r\nAiming to improve this situation, Erika is looking for financing to be able to buy a double stitch machine to be able to have everything needed for the production of her articles of clothing and not incur additional production costs.\r\n\r\nIn this way Erika will be able to save a large amount of money in transportation costs and in paying to be leant a double stitch machine so her monthly income will increase and her business will continue getting ahead.\r\n\r\nErika dreams with having a large shop where she can generate employment for other people thus reaching her dream of becoming a great businesswoman for which she\u2019s been working so hard.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1085783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

Since her husband's salary is not sufficient to support all of the household expenses, she decided to learn how to sew and set up her own dressmaking workshop.  This way she could generate income to make a financial contribution to the household so that her family could have a better quality of life.  Four years ago, she learned this trade when she took a course from a state entity called SENA.  Thanks to this training, she was able to get the knowledge she needed to start up her own dressmaking business.  In her workshop she has some sewing machines with which she does her work, but as she lacks a machine to do the finishing work on the garments, she must pay high prices to a third party to do this work.  For this reason she is now seeking a loan that will allow her to buy a serging machine  that can do the finishing work on her garments; this way she can save on production costs.  This will increase her profit margin, and in this way increase the earnings that she can bring home.  Gloria dreams of making progress with her dressmaking workshop, of providing work for those who need it the most, and of providing her family with a good quality of life and better opportunities for economic progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1088922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

His main business activity is farming and he sows 2 'manzanas' (just under 3.5 acres) of land with corn, beans and sesame.  He has been in this business for more than 15 years.  He lives with his wife.  Santos is requesting this loan so that he can sow corn and beans, buy fertilizers and pesticides, and hire laborers to improve his productivity because, owing to a lack of money, he hasn't been able to improve his production.  The support of this loan will help Santos to enjoy better production and thereby make more income so that he can cover his household expenses, provide his family with a better quality of life, and help them to make progress.\r\n\r\nOne of Santos' dreams is to own his own land as he currently grows his crops on rented land.  He would also like to have an irrigation system so that he can use modern technology in his work and sow a variety of products year round.

She had spent many years in this line of work, and when she began to work from home she taught this trade to her husband.  Afterwards, Aristides began to work alongside her, and ever since he separated from his wife 8 years ago, he has been left in charge of the sewing workshop.  With this business, he has generated the income needed to support the expenses of his household, where he lives with his 2 children.\r\n\r\nIn his workshop, he mainly produces school uniforms for the schools in his area.  Thanks to this work, he is able to have a large quantity of orders, requiring him to transport a large quantity of garments.  Because of this, his transportation expenses have been mounting.  So Aristides is seeking a loan that will allow him to purchase a used vehicle to economically transport his garments and avoid the high shipping costs that he is currently paying.\r\n\r\nIn this way, his business will become more efficient and he will be able to increase his sales.

Her husband does not generate enough income to support the household expenses, so Dalia decided to establish 'miscel\u00e1nea' (a small store that carries a wide variety of goods).  She did this to be able to generate income to contribute financially to the household.  This way her family will be able to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThanks to this business, her family has managed to get ahead and overcome the adversities that life presents.  That is why she works hard with the intention of getting ahead and increasing her sales every day.\r\n\r\nBecause her customers demand a great quantity of products that she does not now have, Dalia is looking for a loan.  She will use the loan to buy toys, stationery, and other goods for her miscellanea.  This way she will be able to respond to the orders that her customers make in her business.\r\n\r\nIn this manner her sales will increase considerably.  This will generate greater income, and her family will enjoy a better quality of live and greater financial opportunities for advancement.\r\n\r\nDalia dreams of having a large business where she will be able to generate employment.

Her first few customers consisted of relatives and friends, but thanks to the good quality of her work, her sales have increased considerably.  Yolanda is encouraged by the large number of orders from her customers, so she is seeking a loan in order to buy supplies and materials needed for making her bamboo crafts.

At her workshop she makes a wide variety of products, including underwear, sports jerseys and apparel. Her high quality work has led to a steady stream of customer orders, and has allowed her to generate income. Even though she runs a successful workshop, her production capacity is low, because she does not have a coating machine. Flor is requesting this loan in order to purchase a coating machine and other input materials for making clothing items. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this new machine will make her process more efficient, and will allow her to speed up her production times, offering improved services to her clients.

His wife abandoned them some time ago, and does not contribute to helping raise their son. Heriberto was working at a job that did not pay him sufficient income to cover his family\u2019s living expenses, so he decided to open a general store. Since he did not have very much startup capital, his shelves are made out of wooden planks and his inventory is scarce.

She is a 45-year-old married mother of four, and she and her family reside in La Soledad neighborhood in Juticalpa, Honduras. Digna makes a living selling groceries and learned this business when she was single since her mother had a convenience store and Digna helped her tend to it. When she got married her husband gave her money to set up her own store and since that time she has managed her own business. Her work day begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 9 p.m., and he eldest son helps her tend to customers. Her biggest disadvantage is that there are numerous convenience stores in her neighborhood, but she always treats her customers very well so they come back. Digna is requesting this loan to purchase general groceries like rice, beans, oil, lard, condiments, refreshments, meats, dairy products, sausages, bread, coffee, churros, vegetables, and other products. With the support of this loan Digna will be able to stock her store with more and varied products and her customers will find what they need, helping her earn more profits. Her goals are to convert her convenience store into a supermarket and to be able to give her children a better quality of life and help them become professionals. She also dreams of building her own home.

She hopes to increase her crop yield to make a better living and build more savings for the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1108704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Prey Chhor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-06-02T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-02T02:20:04Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimsin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50562.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288468,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":809000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347196838,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T09:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":404500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364841116,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":353937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046221,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-03T07:51:04Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":427305,"name":"Adela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Adela tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad es casada y tiene cinco hijos.
