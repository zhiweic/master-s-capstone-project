Throughout the day, she manages all the household work and her husband keeps himself busy selling grocery items from his grocery shop. Shampa wishes to extend this business because their grocery shop is in great demand in her area. There is only one shop in the village of Baroghoria at Dhupguri where the villagers usually buy their daily grocery items. She wants to renovate their shop with more grocery items but they have no capital to meet the demands of the shop. She learned about BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) and requested a loan to buy more grocery items for their shop. In the future, she wants to become a good entrepreneur and improve her business gradually with the profit she can earn from the shop. She can make her concrete house more beautiful with the profit from the business.

With support from a Kiva loan Jacent will cook with gas, and she feels it is high time she also looks for employment.  \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to pay for a cooking gas package that will allow her to cook meals quickly","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Namasuba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.689444 32.421389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":343,"posted_date":"2014-01-02T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T20:30:05Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":240000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T21:08:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653370,"name":"Norah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norah lives in New Kru town, which is one of the oldest communities in Liberia.

He tells why he needs this KIVA loan in its own words: \n\n\"[My] business started as one kiosk in the city of Manokwari and one kiosk in a nearby village.  I am now in the beginning stages of opening two more kiosks in two other villages in the next several months, so that those villages can also have access to clean and affordable drinking water.\n\nIn the province of West Papua, Indonesia, very few people have access to drinking water that is both safe AND affordable.  Many people are forced either to purchase bottled water that is very expensive or boil their own water which also is expensive, labor-intensive, and pollutes the environment.  In the areas far from the city, because boiling water requires so much work, many people risk drinking untreated water and, as a result, continually suffer from water-borne illnesses. Nazava\u2019s water filtration technology provides a superior alternative in its simple design, affordability, and ability to produce safe drinking water. My business\u2019s primary goal is to actively portray Jesus Christ\u2019s love for all people by caring for the physical needs of the people of West Papua via:\n\n1.\tProviding a safe, affordable, and practical clean drinking water solution to the communities throughout Papua Barat.\n2.\tTeaching and equipping other aspiring Papuan entrepreneurs how to open their own kiosks in their villages and how to run a successful kiosk business selling the Nazava filters.\n\nBecause the demand for the Nazava filters is so high, I have trouble keeping sufficient stock to meet the demand.

Last year in August,  Ardakbubu's husband died from a serious illness. Struggling to survive the death of her beloved husband, Ardakbubu braced herself, as it was necessary to start a new life without a spouse but with children who need to land on their feet. The children helped Ardakbubu to recover. <br \/><br \/>Ardakbubu has a specialized high school education. She graduated from a technical school, with a specialty as a cook. She worked as a cook for just five years.<br \/><br \/>As a main source of income for her family, Ardakbubu raises livestock, having started 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 som KGS.

He still lives in his parents\u2019 home in a remote part of the city of Cochabamba.  He is single and doesn\u2019t have any dependent children.  He completed school through high school and is studying to get his degree as a construction specialist because he really wants to improve himself and become more independent.  He has wide experience in the field of construction.  From a very young age he began to work in that field.

She's the mother of two children who live in her house and depend on her because they're in different grades in elementary school.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband make a living growing coffee.

The land she and her husband farm is her own, thanks to an inheritance from her parents because they weren't able to support her in her studies so she could be trained.  The land's located two kilometers from her house; they walk there as a family so she can generate income for her household.  The challenges she has encountered in her farm work are pests and natural weather changes.  Competition isn't a problem for selling her crop and generating income.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel's dream is to acquire more land and more coffee farms to offer her customers a better variety of the crop.  This way she'll be able to improve her income and have greater economic stability to reinvest in her coffee crops and support her children in their studies.\r\n\r\nThis is why she's currently requesting a loan to improve and take care of her crops by applying agricultural inputs such as soil amendments, fertilizer, coffee formula, and fungicide to prevent contamination by pests and diseases.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural inputs for her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T22:00:06Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T04:38:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653411,"name":"Maria Camila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ella es maria camila, actualmente estudia servicios farmac\u00e9uticos en campo alto, el servicio farmac\u00e9utico es muy interesante gracias a sus m\u00faltiples \u00e1reas de estudio y variedad de campos en lo que se puede desarrollar.\nDecid\u00ed estudiar este t\u00e9cnico porque capo alto tiene muy buenas referencias gracias a su buena educaci\u00f3n en todos los programas y por porque el servicio farmac\u00e9utico siempre a sido el \u00e1rea en el que le gustar\u00eda desempe\u00f1arse.\nLe gustar\u00eda acceder al convenio con kiva para poder tener mas facilidad de pago para los estudios y poder culminar con este t\u00e9cnico que es una de las metas para llegar a ser la profesional dentro del \u00e1rea de farmacia.\nCon la ayuda de kiva puede terminar este proceso que ha sido muy gratificante y educativo y sera de gran ayuda en el futuro laboral cuando ya este graduada.\nPodr\u00e1 mejorar las opciones de trabajo y a si poder ayudar a la familia, quiere dar gracias akiva por darle la oportunidad a ella y a muchos estudiantes de campo alto de acceder a la ayuda econ\u00f3mica que facilitara el buen desarrollo de el futuro acad\u00e9mico.\n\n","en":"Maria Camila currently studies Pharmaceutical Services in Campo Alto.

She started with farm labor and household chores when she was ten years old, learning from her parents. She grows her crops on a plot of land close to her house. There are some seasons in which the farm does not do very well and her income to maintain her family is much lower. Therefore, a few months ago, she started raising chickens and taking care of her milk cow so that it produces more milk and she can sell more cheese.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan to buy fertilizer and insecticide to cultivate 7,000 square meters of corn. She will also buy a cage for her chickens. What she most wants, however, is to buy another cow. She hopes to have good harvests and better earnings for her family, so that they do not suffer what she suffered.

Her husband is a farmer, and children attend a school.  Aigul has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 18 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aigul's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows, 2 horses and 5 calves. Aigul and her family already prepared 450 haystacks, 1 ton of barley and 8 tons of corn.  Aigul sells 20 liters of milk daily to distributors.  The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Aigul requested a loan from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy cows to increase livestock headcount. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities and saving money to build a house for her son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kegety village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aigul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-01T00:32:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641403,"name":"Sarafeen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarafeen is a 39-year-old woman, living with her five children and spouse in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been driving an auto rickshaw which does not belong to him.

She finished Primary School and has been active in her business ever since. Her partner works as a driver and also in agriculture, and helps her economically and emotionally to support the family. Clara\u00b4s biggest dream is to travel outside of Guatemala to explore other countries, especially Israel.\n\nShe has a creative, eco-friendly business in San Juan del Obispo, close to Antigua,Guatemala. She produces and sells crafted lamps that she distributes nationally with the help of her domestic partner and two of her sons. She uses many recycled items in the construction of her lamps. She has been very successful in past years, but has recently been affected by cheap Asian competition flooding the market.\n\nIn order to stay competitive Clara wants to secure a loan of GTQ20,000 over 24 months, in order to reinvest in her business and increase her sales in the future. Her projected monthly profit for 2014 is GTQ8,000, assuming that she sells 1200 lamps of different sizes each month. This implies an increase in profit of 158% compared to her current profit of GTQ3,100 per month.\n\nShe wants to invest her loan money in new materials, such as specialty paper and stuffed animals, and in special tools for working with wood and ceramics. She is full of good ideas for new strategies to improve her sales such as finding new clients, hiring one of her sons full time, and starting to produce different styles of lamps, made out of pottery and wood. It is the size and scope of what she is trying to do \nthat make her an exceptional candidate for the advanced training and larger loan of the Namaste STARZ program.\n\nThe STARZ program is unique in the world of microfinance as the loan repayments are tied to the profits of the borrower instead of being fixed payments. Since loan payments are linked to profits she can ride out business cycles or other unforeseen events.\n\nThrough the STARZ program high potential women receive intensive business coaching bi-weekly over two to three years. They also receive a formal six-month education in financial literacy and business operations that leads to a diploma in Small and Medium Enterprise Management by the Guatemalan Technical Institute for Training and Productivity (INTECAP). \n\nCredit is not generally available to women with businesses of this size, so an important program element is a right-sized business loan. The women also receive coaching in leadership, economic and gender empowerment, and renegotiating household power relationships. By working with Fundaci\u00f3n Namaste Guatemaya, the STARZ participant and her business advisor have a continuous-loop, real-time monitoring, evaluation and learning system."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy new materials, such as specialty paper and stuffed animals, and special tools for working with wood and ceramics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Juan del Obispo, Antigua, Sacatep\u00e9quez","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2013-12-03T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-01T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":24,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-13T07:01:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653026,"name":"San Martin  - Izcuchaca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"CLARA ES UNA MUJER EMPRENDEDORA QUE TIENE 39 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD,SOLTERA Y A SU CARGO TIENE 02 HIJOS EN ETAPA ESCOLAR.\nELLA TRABAJA VENDIENDO PANES ESPECIALES EN LA PLAZA DE SU LOCALIDAD, LOS INGRESOS QUE OBTIENE DE ESAS VENTAS, LO UTILIZA PARA SUS GASTOS DEL HOGAR;

married, and, along with her husband, a retired schoolteacher.  Both of them worked as teachers for a long time before retiring, and are currently farming livestock even though they're getting up there in years.  All her children are married and live on their own except for the youngest, who lives with them and helps them tend to their farm.  \r\n\r\nGulaiym is an old hand at raising livestock; she's been at it 43 years, and started off with only 1,000 som worth of animals.  Thanks to her persistence and hard work, she currently has 2 dairy cows and 6 sheep on her farm, and her monthly income is nearly 10,000 som.  To expand her farm, she's seeking a loan from Bai Tushum and Partners to buy a heifer.  She plans on using any extra money that the loan will allow her to make to add even more livestock to her farm, as well as to save money to buy a car.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy a heifer for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Murdash village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulaiym","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1986},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2043},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2103},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2164},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2227},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2292},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2359},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-06T17:41:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641428,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is married, and has children.

He only studied until the 8th grade because financial resources were scarce and he could not continue his school work and so he dedicated himself full time to working. His partner is a housewife and they have 2 children. One is 4 and about to begin kindergarten and one is 2 months old.\r\n\r\nEver is a small farmer. He works 7,000 square meters of corn. He learned as a youth since his father was a farmer and taught him this work. He has also been working for 15 years in a carpentry workshop as there are times when the harvest only provides enough for consumption and he needs to pay some expenses. He does not have a work schedule but when he is in the workshop he gets there at 7:00AM and as he is paid by piece work he does not have a set departure time. \r\n\r\nHe plans to use the loan to work 7,000 square meters of irrigated corn, God willing, to harvest in April. The loan gives him an opportunity to get ahead as the money that he earns in the carpentry workshop will be used to pay for school fees for his son and for feeding the family.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a better quality of life and to be able to support his children so they can have the education he was not able to have. The loan will provide a motivation to work and make more sacrifices in order to be certain not only that he can meet his dreams and those of his family but also he is thinking of not being an employee of a workshop but to have his own carpentry workshop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1503998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies and to work 7,000 square meters of irrigated corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ever Ulises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T05:02:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653415,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After losing her husband to the violence of South Sudan, Joyce fled the country with her children in search of a new life. When she arrived in Kenya, she made contact with a British organization that assists refugees in Nairobi, and after a few months of waiting, Joyce and her family were permitted to immigrate to the United States as refugees.\r\n\r\nDespite experiencing the tremendous culture shock of moving to a new country, Joyce made the best of her situation. She found a job at a San Diego health center and worked there until she was recently laid off.  She began looking for employment through a temporary employment agency, but had difficulty finding a job in the crowded job market. Instead of letting her circumstances hold her back, she instead saw it as an opportunity to take her employment into her own hands. \r\n\r\nShe began selling a variety of cultural goods, such as traditional Sudanese clothing and art pieces, taking out her first microloan to fund her venture.  She eventually moved into selling lotions, perfumes and cr\u00e8mes at local swap meets, focusing on selling consumer goods that would appeal to the local African immigrant community.  \r\n\r\nNow on her eighth microloan, Joyce has demonstrated tremendous character through the years with regular, on-time repayments and a commitment to growing her business. She plans to use her $4,000 Kiva loan to increase her inventory, enabling her to sell at additional outdoor markets and ultimately grow her income.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what her business dream would be, she shared, \u201cI want to become financially independent and perhaps start my own import and export business one day.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1504963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more inventory to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Diego","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2014-01-03T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":129.15},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":140.98},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":149.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":153.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.56},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":160.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":165.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":166.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":169.33},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":179.98},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":185.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":188.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":191.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":197.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.76},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.65},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.59},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T19:56:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641476,"name":"Sreyheang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sreyheang (pictured here), age 23, is single.

This will be the first stage, since his salary as a machine operator in a free zone is very little, and it does not allow him to make the investment all at once, since he also has to cover the principal household expenses and school for his children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy construction materials: cement, sand, blocks, iron, and gravel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T04:32:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":641487,"name":"Sreymom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sreymom is 27-years-old.

Her attention to detail in particular ensures that her clients are operating in complete compliance with government grants at all times. \r\n\r\nRasheedah is also a graduate of the Accion Academy for Entrepreneurial Success, an 8-week entrepreneurship course that walks students from business plan to launch. Upon successful completion of the course, students receive a business loan of up to $5,000 funded by Kiva. They also receive the education, tools and encouragement needed to turn their business dreams into a reality.\r\n\r\nGraduating from the academy was exactly the kind of boost Rasheedah needed to finally launch her business. She will use her $5,000 Kiva loan to purchase a new computer and much needed software for her business. She will also build a new website to help her acquire new clients.\r\n\r\nAs Rasheedah\u2019s business grows, she is determined to create her own agency and eventually hire employees to offer more services. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to build a solid foundation for my son and niece to have a bright future,\u201d said Rasheedah."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1505029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to

Her daughter is 12 years old and is in school. Nazgul has a higher education. She works as a teacher in a local school. She has a lot of experience working with children, therefore all the children in the village and their parents respect her very much as a highly-qualified teacher and simple person. <br \/><br \/>As a source of additional income for her family, Nazgul is engaged in raising livestock, having started 19 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 6,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Nazgul currently has on her homestead: two dairy cows, two horses, and 13 sheep. Her husband - a farmer - helps Nazgul around the farm. Together they prepare the feed in unison, change the water, and clean the stable. Nazgul manages to teach at the school and to take care of her household.

","en":"Lola is a kind and responsible woman from the city of Qurgan-Tube.  She is 31 years old, married, and she has three children (two daughters who are 12 and 7 years old, and a son who is 5).  For the past two years, she has been sewing traditional Tajik comforters from quilted cotton called, \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\".  Her sewing services are always in high demand because in every Tajik family, a young woman receives a \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\" when she gets married.  For this reason, Lola's business is quite profitable.\r\n\r\nLola's husband works on a construction site in Russia, and sends money home every month so that his wife can take care of the family's expenses.  Lola currently wants to help her brother-in-law (her sister's husband), who, until now, had been providing taxi services, for a few years, using his own car.  However, Lola's sister and and brother-in-law have had to perform major repairs in their house lately.  Having miscalculated their financial capacity, they ended up having to sell the car to complete their home repairs, which left the family without any source of income.  Lola is well aware of her sister's difficult circumstances, and she would like to help her.\r\n\r\nLola already has some savings, but she is also requesting a loan to cover the missing amount.

He has the help of one employee and he works every day from 7 a.m. until 8:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nCurrently Mauricio's requesting the support of a loan to make modifications to his place (to fix the kitchen) to optimize the space and be able to comply with all the health rules the law obliges.  This will generate more trust in the customers about the product they're consuming, consequently allowing him to increase his sales.\r\n\r\nHis main wish is to be able to make his business grow and, in the future, start a company to produce this food to distribute in other cities.

Currently, she is dedicated to working as an operator in a plastic bag factory but, for approximately one year, she rotates her job with her own small business making fruit pulp. The idea came from her daughter who has knowledge of this work and she has the support of her spouse since she must meet the working hours of her current job and spends her free time dedicated to her business. Her drive, perseverance and positive attitude has allowed her to overcome different obstacles, especially the difficulty buying ingredients, the fact that her house is very far from the market square. Nevertheless she has managed to face the situation and get ahead.

Orfelina's partner works in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nOrfelina is a housewife but to earn her own money and support her husband with household costs, she also sells Avon products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes, and women's accessories).  Orfelina sells door-to-door.  She works every day as she also has a small chicken farm - with up to 100 chickens per season - in her home.  With this work, she is able to earn a little extra money, without even having to leave the house.  Orfelina has been selling Avon products for eight years and has been working with the chickens much longer.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy perfumes, creams and cosmetics, and feed and medicine for the chickens.  Orfelina has been part of this loan group for over ten years and she likes it because she receives loans.  Orfelina's dream is continue prospering in life and in her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":171.87,"image":{"id":1358883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfumes, creams, and cosmetics, and chicken feed and medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Tosagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orfelina Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1370.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":171.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171.87,"local_amount":171.31,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":171.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730402,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-05T08:24:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640742,"name":"Nancy Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Tosagua cada quince d\u00edas se re\u00fane el Grupo De  Cr\u00e9dito Amistad, este lugar se lo conoce por ser muy din\u00e1mico donde la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes se dedican a la agricultura y a la cr\u00eda de animales, por ser una zona con gran vegetaci\u00f3n.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Nancy, tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene tres hijos mayores de edad, dos de ellos aun viven en su casa y estudian en universidad.

with her husband, is raising four children. All of her children are little, with the oldest being 11 years old and the youngest, 2 years old. Damira has a higher education. She works as a teacher at a local school. She has a small salary. Her husband works odd jobs as he cannot find full-time employment. \r\n\r\nAs an additional source of income for her family, Damira practices livestock breeding. She started this business 14 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Damira's hard work, she currently has 7 milk cows, 1 horse and 6 sheep on her farm. Damira is very hardworking. Everyday she gets up at the crack of dawn and gets her children ready for school. Then she cuts hay and waters her livestock, goes to work, returns home for lunch, feeds her livestock again, meets her children at school, brings them home, feeds them dinner and finishes her work in the barn. \r\n\r\nShe is very motivated and believes that by working hard and consistently on her animal breeding business, she will be able to improve her family's wellbeing and provide a better future for her children. Her monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Damira turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Damira plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bashky-Terek village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T13:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T13:00:18Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-20T15:16:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":653484,"name":"Gianpool Yirko","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gian est\u00e1 agradecido con los prestamistas kiva ya que gracias a su apoyo el podr\u00e1 comprar mercader\u00eda como ropa, adornos, entre otros para poder ofrecer en esta temporada navide\u00f1a y de esta manera poder tener un ingreso extra y seguir luchando para poder hacer realidad su gran sue\u00f1o:\u201d Tener su casa propia\u201d.","en":"Gian is grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their support he'll be able to buy clothing, decorations, and other merchandise to sell this Christmas season.

Her older daughter is 17 years old and is a student in the eleventh grade. Her son is 13 years old and a student in the seventh grade. Batma and her children were left without the main member of their family, without a father and husband. She dreams that her children will study at a prestigious university so that the will have good jobs. Unfortunately, Batma only finished secondary school and for the last 16 years has been in the business of animal breeding. She started this business 16 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Batma's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 15 sheep on her farm. Her monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). For the purpose of further developing her business, Batma turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan to buy cows to increase the size of her herd. Batma plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock. She also intends to save money for the future education of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1484411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kerben town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-04T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-02T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-29T13:37:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":649307,"name":"Corazon De Jesus Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo\u201d CORAZON DE JESUS\u201d est\u00e1 conformada por 09 socios trabajadores y emprendedores.
