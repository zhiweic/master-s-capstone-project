lives and works in St. Paul.  St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish due to its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the Free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \r\n\r\nWeedor is 39 years old, married with two children aged 11 and 8, who live at home and are in school. She completed 12 grades.\r\n\r\nShe runs a cook shop business selling rice and soup.  She describes herself as a serious businesswoman. She started her business ten years ago, using money given to her by her husband.  Typically, she works 7 am to 8 pm from Monday to Saturday at her business and transports her goods to her business by shared taxi.  She cites her greatest challenge as not enough capital.  She is proud of her business because she makes a lot of profit.\r\n\r\nUsing the proceeds of this loan, she intends to purchase more rice, peppers, oil, Vita, onions, fish, and dried bush-meat for her business.  In the future, she plans to build her house and educate her children.  She sincerely thanks you in advance for your

She lives in a house with her mother and her siblings, and they all work in agriculture.  She has a lot of experience growing potatoes and it is an activity that she has done for more than 15 years.  Her workplace is only 5 minutes from her house.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, her biggest challenge is that there is no electricity in the region in which her home is located.  Furthermore, there are no plans to install electricity in the area.  Nowadays, it is necessary to have lighting in the home and so she has to use wood, gas lamps, and candles.\r\n\r\nBut with the help she is asking for today, she will be able to buy a solar panel which will help her keep the house lit and she can avoid the smoke from the wood and candles that harms her family\u2019s health and the environment.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to someday sell her products in large quantities because this will help her to generate a higher income for her family and then they can expand their crops.

Claire hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a commercial house for herself. \r\n\r\nClaire is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.18,"image":{"id":1366773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Feruza is a very hardworking and energetic young woman.  Her husband is working in the Russian Federation.  The husband's salary alone is not enough, and this is why Feruza decided not to stay at home and to help her husband.  She decided to earn money independently.  She opened her store, where she provides copy services, two years ago in the district center.  Feruza attracted enough customers over these two years.  Currently, she wants to expand and start providing computer services.  In order to realize her plans, she has to purchase a computer, but does not have enough money for this.  This is why Feruza requested a loan from the Arvand organization.

Her name is Karoson. She is 47, married, and has one 15 year-old daughter and one son who is grown up. Her husband is retired and has a small pension. Karoson has been involved in animal husbandry for more than 26 years. She is very experienced, for starting when she was very young, she helped her mother feed the cattle. She continued to raise livestock after she got married, for her husband did not earn much income. She runs the business by herself.

45-year-old Mabinty from Tombo Western rural area in Freetown. She is married with 3 children who are between the ages of 10 and 23 years. Two of her children are currently attending school. In 2006, Mabinty established her fish business. She began her business because she needed to generate income to support the home. She works at the business 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. She says that the main challenge to her business is lack of enough capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMabinty requires a loan in order to buy more fish and palm oil to resell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and improve her level of living. In the future, Mabinty plans to expand her business even more.

","en":"This is Buvsara's second loan from us.  She has a good credit history, since she is an honest and responsible woman.  Buvsara is 46 years old and she is married with four children at home.  Her husband is a migrant worker because he couldn't find suitable work in his own country.  While she was still living in her childhood home, Buvsara began to sew women's national costumes.  She sews dresses with a great deal of interest - it is her favorite thing to do.  Buvsara's craft has come in handy because after she got married, her husband's income was not enough to support the family.  She works hard to provide for her children.  She has a plot of land where she has started building a new home for her family.  At the moment, she doesn't have enough money to finish the construction of the home.  She is asking for a loan of 3,000 US dollars to buy building materials like cement, sand, wood, etc.  She is awaiting your kindness and promises to repay her loan on

","en":"Gulniso is an enthusiastic and motivated woman.  She is 33 years old and she is married with two children at home.  Her eldest child is six and her youngest child is one year old.  Gulniso's husband is a migrant worker in the Russian Federation.  He works there and sends money to his wife and children so they can buy the things they need.  For more than 15 years, Gulniso has been working as a school teacher.  When she is not working, she grows crops because she is poor and needs the money.

She made her shelves, display cases, and her work desk and cash box and she opened her store in her community. After working for 2 years, she has become established and she offers clothing merchandise and sandals that are very popular in the area of Puntarenas. Going over the business' documents, the additional income with the meals and her daughters' help, one can see that the work, which is contributed to by the whole family, allows her to serve her customers and offer high quality merchandise.

","en":"Shodigul has been a client of IMON for seven years.  She is an organized woman and she has a good reputation not only at IMON, but among her family and friends.  Shodigul is 61 years old and she is married with four children.  For more than six years, she has been involved in raising crops like wheat, watermelons and corn.  She works in the field from the early morning hours and she finds satisfaction in her work.  Her business savvy increases with each passing year.

Paynesville North has the largest market in Montserrado County.  The area is home to 'round time marketers', traders who travel to the interior to purchase various goods to sell throughout the county.  As a result, there is a high concentration of wholesalers in the area who distribute to various markets around Montserrado County, including Monrovia.\n\nNaomi started her business with money from her mother; she has owned her own table business for the past ten years, selling rubber dishes such as bowls, plates, spoons, etc.  She transports her merchandise by taxi, and on average, she works at her business six day of a week, spending ten hours each day.  She cites the high price of goods as her biggest challenge.  Her favorite part of the business is it keeps her busy.\n\nShe will use the loan to purchase more rubber dishes(bowls, plates, spoons, etc)for her business.  \n    \nIn the future, she would like to own a house.  \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.3,"image":{"id":1366136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more rubber dishes(bowls, plates, spoons, etc)for her business.

meet Martha, a 32-year-old woman from Liberia.  She is married, and her husband works as a security guard.  They live in Nimba County, in Liberia.  Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore.  The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.  As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade.  It is also the second most populous area in Liberia.\n\nMartha has had her own shop for two years now.  She sells groceries, for example, rice, flour, candy, biscuits and milk.  She works at her business nine hours per day.  She transports her goods to her business by bus. The biggest challenge she faces in her business is having too few goods in her shop.  She will use the loan to buy more inventory.\n\nShe went to school and finished grade 12. She has a 7-year-old child.  She describes herself as a hardworking woman.  She started her business with money from her mother. In the future, she wants to own a house.  Martha is proud of her business, because she earns money every day, for her expenses.  She wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

However, it is also one of the poorer areas, and housing quality is often very bad. \n\nKadiatu is single and has a three years old child. The child lives at home and goes to school.\n \nKadiatu has a sales table, where she sells foods like bread, sugar, oil and rice.  She has been in business for five years and works nine hours per day. With this loan, she will buy inventory.  One of the greatest challenges that she faces is low income.  She transports her goods by taxi.  She started her business with money from her father.  Kadiatu is proud of her business, because she makes more profit. Her plan is to build a house.  She would like to thank the lenders who support BRAC Liberia.

is 27 years old, single and lives in Nimba County in Liberia. Nimba is one of the most resource-rich areas in Liberia, producing minerals such as iron ore. The county shares a border with both Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Guinea. As a result, many people on business pass through the area, bringing lots of trade. It is also the second most populous area in Liberia. \n\nMayamu has had a shop business for the past two years and sells rice, oil, Vita (juice drink), salt, and bitter ball (an eggplant-like vegetable). She works at her business spending 10 hours every day. She transports her goods to her business by taxi.The biggest challenge she faces in her business is fewer goods in her shop.  \n\nWith the proceeds from the loan, she wants to buy inventory. She describes herself as a hardworking woman. She started her business with money from her mother. \n\nIn the future, she wants to own a house. She is proud of her business because she gets money everyday for her expenses.  \n\nShe wants to say thanks to the lenders who support BRAC

The business has been in operation for four years. He says the main challenges he faces are lack of working capital to restock. \r\n\r\nFortune has requested a loan of $750  to restock in bulk, thus avoiding constant trips to wholesalers, since he operates far from the town where they are located. He says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow him to cover his expenses, both at home and in the business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fortune plans to save enough from the loan
