Her crops are located 1.5 kilometers from her house.\r\n\r\nMaria is asking for help to be able to buy fertilizer, manure, insecticide, and a fumigation pump for her coffee crop, since nowadays these kinds of products are expensive, and the rust, which is a damaging fungus, contaminates and damages a whole harvest if it is not treated in time.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to have a large coffee plantation that can continue to bless and sustain the family and be worked generation after generation by her children, her grandchildren, and the next generations as it is today, forming a family inheritance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1342518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to be able to buy fertilizer, manure, insecticide, and a fumigation pump for her coffee crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"santiago de puringla, la paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-04-29T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-29T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De La Paz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-29T23:43:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554731,"name":"Silvia Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia, se dedica a la venta de pan.

His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Albert trades in nails. The income is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Albert applied for a loan from Credo for a start-up family business. Albert has now been approved for the loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Albert and his wife will begin trading in fruits and vegetables. He plans to purchase fruits and vegetables from wholesalers and then resell them at higher prices. He will be able to increase the family income. Part of the profit will be reinvested in the same business, and he will use another part to provide a better future for his children. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

He is applying for a 6,590,000 TZS to be shared by his loan group \"Faith,\" which totals fifteen members who will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan. \r\n<p>\r\nWith his previous loan portions Eliasi added a super-sport dish for football fans and other related games and programs to attract more customers. He also restocked food items like sodas, water, juices, meat, fish and bananas . \r\n<p>\r\nWith his profits he bought a plot of land upon which he expects to start building, covered school fees and bought a cupboard for his home. He plans to use this loan to repair his business premises and restock inventory. His ambition is to be able to build a house and expand his businesses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":1340887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to repair his business premises and restock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2013-04-29T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-29T23:20:03Z","loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Husseni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Florency","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramadhani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nuru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":6590000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":411875},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":411875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.68},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":887.61,"local_amount":1435425,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1441020.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373039423,"comment":null},{"amount":1104.83,"local_amount":1786700,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1793664.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381829991,"comment":null},{"amount":1313.29,"local_amount":2123825,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2132104.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390688221,"comment":null},{"amount":769.27,"local_amount":1244050,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1248899.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399934860,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T04:00:46Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:23:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":553864,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita is 42 years old, and married with six children.

is 22 years old. He lives in the small village of Vani District with his parents. George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. Specifically, they have a milking cow whose milk is used in cheese production. In addition, they have a vineyard with 200 grape vines and agricultural land where nut trees are grown. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets. \r\n\r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-ups and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

They are located in the main municipality which is known for its traditional celebrations.  The members of the group say that they used to work with another micro-finance group named \"La Conchita\", but they had many internal problems so decided to change.  They met Vision Fund and, for them, it is a new way of working.  Since they were beginning again, they took the name \"La Nueva Esperanza\" (New Hope).  Mary, 48, is the representative of the group.  She is married to Manuel and they have four dependent children. \r\n\r\nMary has been in the business of selling tacos since she was 16.  She says she began the business because a relative of her husband's had a restaurant-bar but after a while decided to close it.  Mary's husband opened the business again to sell tacos.  On this occasion, Mary is requesting a loan to buy soft drinks, gas, benches and chairs for her business.  She enjoys her work and through much effort and hard work has been able to open four street vending locations.  However, these are not her own places, but on loan, and Mary lives with the anguish that one day she will be ousted.

She lives with her family in a small village. Since she was a little girl, she dreamed of becoming a school teacher. But right after graduating from school, her parents married her off, and she had to forget about her dreams and devote her time to being a housewife. Soon there were children, and with them, lots of worry. In order to have some type of income, she began to raise livestock. She bought a pair of cows and she began to tend to them and fatten them. She sold the milk in her village. Her children helped her to deliver the milk and various dairy products. Now Djamilia has been operating this business of raising and fattening animals for 15 years. Her husband drives a taxi and sends her money each month, but it's only enough for them to buy food. Djamilia wants to expand her business by buying another cow to get more income, improve her family's economic standing, and to save money to send her children to college. So Djamilia has turned to Arvand for a loan to buy a cow to expand her business. She is counting heavily their assistance, and thanks Arvand in adavnce."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1338221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Bobojon Gafurov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1573.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1626.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.87},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":331.87,"local_amount":1573.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616104,"comment":null},{"amount":343.13,"local_amount":1626.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1633.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859973,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T13:50:56Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554045,"name":"Francess S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francess S. is a 24-year-old woman who lives with her three children in West Point, one of the most populated and well known markets in Montserrado county.

is a Balinese artisan who specializes in silver jewelry. She has been selling through NOVICA since 2006. She would like to invest in more sterling silver to create new jewelry designs.\r\n\r\n This is her story:\r\n\r\n\"I come from Celuk, famous for its gold and silversmiths, so I learned to design and craft jewelry from a very young age. In 2003, I married an artist from Gianyar and went to live with his family, like Balinese tradition dictates. However, I obsessed with crafting jewelry and fortunately, my husband understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so grateful for the chance to get a micro-credit loan. This will help me to create more stock and also to prepare new designs. I am so thankful for all your support, and hopefully, you would like to collect the jewelry I make. It would also be wonderful if you'd recommend my jewelry to your friends and families. It will mean so much when my designs are known and worn by lovely people everywhere in the world.

a native of San Antonio, Michael has always been in tune with the local music scene, nightlife and culture of the South Texas city. While working as a webmaster for four years, Michael learned about the powerful impact that online technology and social media have in bringing people together.  His technical experience in graphic and web design, coupled with his love for entertainment, led him to create entForm.com, an online entertainment news portal and e-commerce marketplace.\r\n\r\nRather than compete against or replicate existing local entertainment websites, entForm collaborates with other websites to feature their articles and events on one central website for the convenience of San Antonio residents and visitors alike. After extensively researching the strengths and weaknesses of similar websites, Michael determined that the best way to differentiate entForm was to actively engage its users. In addition to searching articles and events, users will be able to submit their own articles, music and photographs, as well as comment and share information with their social network friends.\r\n\r\nThe one-stop-shop website will also have an e-commerce component. Users will be able to sell and purchase a variety of items through the site\u2019s online marketplace in a secure and appealing manner. Advertising opportunities will be available to local businesses looking to reach new audiences and grow their own sales.\r\n\r\nMichael is excited to launch his new business venture. To augment what he has learned in his four years as a webmaster, Michael has sought opportunities to learn more about managing and operating an online business.

since he was 15 years old and offered his father a helping hand with his air conditioning repair business, Juan has known what he has wanted to do. So by the time the 32-year-old started his own business, Superior Refrigeration A\/C Service & Supply, Juan had more than a decade of experience. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt all started with an idea in high school,\u201d Juan said. \r\n\r\nFrom helping his father with his AC business, Juan knew that people in South Texas desperately need their air conditioning to function during the summer. Understanding the simple economics of supply and demand, he knew his experience would go a very long way. Juan said his father taught him to do a good job, shake someone\u2019s hand, and complete a job. Since opening his own business 2 \u00bd years ago, Juan said he has seen a dramatic demand for his services. \r\n\r\nJuan turned to a banker at Capital One, who then referred him to Accion Texas. Juan used his Accion Texas loan to purchase a special service van to carry equipment and also for working capital. With the extra working capital, he is able to purchase the parts he needs to repair air conditioning units in advance.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Juan employees subcontractors for large projects and is also subcontracted by his father\u2019s business when his father needs help.

Anarkan plans to invest the proceeds obtained from the loan into further enlarging her livestock herd, and in the future, her family would like to get a car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":837.5,"image":{"id":1340060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ogonbaev village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40516.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777070,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T17:04:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554166,"name":"Idalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For 30 years, Idalia operated a meat market in her home region of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico.

up almost 2,000 miles away from the Pacific Ocean, Justin never imagined he would be running his own business renting scuba and surf gear in the sunny coastal city of San Diego. Most likely destined to be doing hard labor for an oil company back in Louisiana, Justin drove out to California to visit a family friend and drastically changed the course of his future.\r\n \r\nIn what he calls a \u201cfall off the turnip truck\u201d moment, he arrived at the beach and immediately felt a connection. Embraced by the warm climate and laid-back culture, Justin knew he had arrived at his new home. Even though he had been a country boy all his life, Justin\u2019s ambition led him to get his scuba certification. Seeing the potential to quickly generate a return on his investment, he went through the process of becoming a certified scuba instructor and started working for different shops around town. \r\n\r\nHe eventually started his own company, Pacific Beach Sports, renting water sports equipment such as scuba gear and paddleboards. He moved into a storefront in the heart of San Diego\u2019s famous Pacific Beach, filled the racks with equipment to rent or buy, and made connections with other instructors to lead certification classes in the space. \r\n \r\nNow almost two years in, he has seen significant growth but is ready to take his business to the next level. Justin\u2019s $7,000 Kiva loan will enable him to purchase additional inventory and better market his business to grow its visibility in the community.  \r\n\r\nJustin hopes to eventually grow Pacific Beach Sports into San Diego\u2019s premiere water sports rental and sales company, helping others experience the natural beauty and excitement of the city that he fell in love with so many years ago.\r\n\r\nFor more information or to rent gear on your next trip to San Diego, check out his website: http:\/\/www.pacbeachsports.com\/

Her husband supports her with his salary to contribute to the home expenses, and he also takes care of the grocery store when she goes out to sell tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan to buy firewood, corn, soft drinks, basic grains, cheese, cream, eggs, bread, milk, cleaning products, etc. In the future, she hopes to buy shelves to exhibit her products and to improve the infrastructure of her home in order to have a decent place to live."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1341426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy firewood, corn, soft drinks, basic grains, cheese, cream, eggs, bread, milk, cleaning products, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T15:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T15:30:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edda Ramona \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":518.8,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381971988,"comment":null},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":87.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390837352,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860637,"comment":null},{"amount":89.3,"local_amount":88.25,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:53Z","rounded_local_amount":89.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410349344,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":86.47,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901460,"comment":null},{"amount":85.69,"local_amount":84.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":85.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550596,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T19:15:16Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:15:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554248,"name":"Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emmanuel lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which has a high regional output of maize.

Fsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kabati FSA (Financial and Savings Association) is a village bank dedicated to improving the lives of its community members.\n\nMost of the FSA\u2019s members live on less than $1 a day, have little collateral, and are therefore unable to access loans through traditional banking services. Its members are mainly farmers and those working in the informal sector, such as shopkeepers, market vendors, and tailors. Most of the FSA members live in a rural setting and cook using open fires and inefficient mud stoves. These produce health-damaging smoke and contribute to the deforestation that is destroying Kenya\u2019s environment. Paradigm\u2019s cookstoves will reduce the toxic smoke by 70% and will reduce the fuel needed to cook by up to 50%. \n\nKabati FSA was started in 2004 and has around 4,000 members, 70% of whom are women. The FSA mainly disburses business loans at a very low interest rate. It has a repayment rate of close to 100%. The FSA is fully owned and governed by its members, all of whom have shares in the bank.\n\nKabati FSA introduced Paradigm\u2019s improved cookstoves to its members in August 2012. The stoves were received extremely well by its members. Most are extremely eager to purchase a cookstove. However, paying for the product upfront presents a challenge. It is difficult for the FSA to raise enough low-interest capital to finance the cookstoves for its members, as business loans make up the majority of the FSA\u2019s loan portfolio. With a loan from Kiva, Kabati FSA will be able to offer cookstoves to its members in four monthly installments. \n\nWith a Kiva loan, Kabati FSA will receive 290 fuel-efficient cookstoves from Paradigm and will offer its members manageable financing terms to purchase a stove. This will make the cookstoves accessible to even the lowest income members of the FSA.  \n\nHelp improve the health and financial stability of a rural family in Kenya today!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4500,"image":{"id":1336900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase cookstove products for sale to end users","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitui","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":286,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T16:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T16:40:01Z","loan_amount":4500,"lender_count":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kabati Fsa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4495,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1123.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":4500,"local_amount":4495,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381807989,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T05:16:17Z","paid_date":"2013-08-06T09:18:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554290,"name":"Fayia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 40-year-old Fayia.

She has 5 siblings and her parents are very loving. Her father is a farmer and her mother is a teacher. Carol enjoyed school and met a lot of special people there. She graduated from secondary school recently. Her parents have always wanted their daughter to get ahead, and it's for this reason that they sent her to the city to live with relatives, because in the place where she was born there aren't very many universities or options for work. \r\n\r\nIn the first semester she was trying to get into public universities but it wasn't possible. She couldn't study that semester because private universities are very expensive and her parents aren't able to pay for them. \r\n\r\nSomebody told Carol about the corporation for higher education, where she found a great opportunity for easily financing her studies. She signed up in the technical professional program for financial accounting and started in the second semester that same year. She did this with the help of her parents, who, with some difficulty, paid for her studies until she reached the age of majority. \r\n\r\nFrom there, Carol began to work and her parents supported her, since they recognized how difficult it would be for them to continue to pay for her studies. Through a friend, Carol began to work at a call center where she has been working for 8 months. She recognizes that it is very difficult but at times is is necessary to make sacrifices to get what you want. Thanks to her job, Carol can pay for her studies and personal expenses. She has very little free time, because she studies in the morning and works in the evening, but she enjoys it because she knows that some day her hard work will pay off. She considers herself an entrepreneurial person, so she has her future well thought out. She plans to become a professional in accounting and finance when she finishes her degree. \r\n\r\nCarol is currently in her 4th semester and feels very proud of herself. For this reason, she is very happy that there are organizations like Kiva that want to provide support and promote the development of higher education across the world, in particular in her country that has few opportunities but is full of many people like her who want to get ahead in life. She feels very grateful for Kiva's help and for the success that Kiva has in advancing projects that support young students."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1343100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her studies in financial accounting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroll Vannesa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":260000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":137279.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891056,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137279.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912461,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T18:11:37Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554321,"name":"Khaled","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaled is 23 years old and from Gaza.

She chose to study nursing because she thinks it is one of the most valuable professions. It consists of helping people and learning how to care for oneself and for others. It also develops strength, integrity, respect and responsibility. It contributes to form a decisive personality and to put one's integrity and people's health before other considerations. A nursing career also allows one to gain knowledge which the lender will use in the future to develop her profession with pride and responsibility.\r\nNursing is a way for her to grow as a person and to get ahead in life with a profession that helps her as well as the rest of people. It also brings added value to the society by providing immediate and opportune help for the community.\r\nAngie has made a lot of efforts to study but they are still not enough. The jobs she has held are temporary, for hours, months or days. She has worked as a babysitter, among other things. Her mum helps her whenever she can but she has to take care of the household chores. She also helps Angie with a little money when she can. Angie and her mother live alone since Angie's father left two years ago and he provides very little help. He is living elsewhere with Angie's grandparents and has to help them.\r\nAngie hopes to finish her studies without obstacles. While she continues to study she will do the internship and finally, with a little more experience, she hopes to find a job where she can continue to learn and that allows her to finish her nursing studies and keep learning.\r\nAngie also wants to help her mother with the household expenses, with the tranquility that her own expenses will not be high. She hopes to save enough money for the semester, because sometimes she struggles to save for the full fee due to additional expenses and, like she mentioned, she has only found short-term jobs, often with low pays. This is why Kiva's loan would be very helpful for her and for many other students that want to finish their studies, work and forward their careers. She hopes to get the loan for the above mentioned reasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1343204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her academic program","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":420000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":140000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":152532.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891058,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":280000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":305064.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381912463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T20:18:27Z","paid_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554347,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is 58 years old, married, and has three children.

He also will pay for labor for the planting and later for help on the plantation, and this way assure himself of doing a good job. What he hopes to do is take advantage of the good topography and fertility of the land that he has for this crop, and also to put in practice several years of experience in the management of these plants. He also wants to buy the best, highest-quality products so that his plantation will be well-developed and healthy and have adequate production in the short term. He hopes to obtain income from the harvest and use it for the wellbeing of his family, to meet some family goals, and to continue investing more in the crops. This is the first loan that he has received from FUDECOSUR. He has not had other loans before at state banks, but FUDECOSUR has given him the loan with easier terms and a much lower interest rate."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0.38,"image":{"id":1343133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to grow \u00f1amp\u00ed (a root vegetable similar to a sweet potato)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"La Virgen de Guagaral","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":150,"posted_date":"2013-04-30T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-30T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mart\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2015-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":0.38,"local_amount":184.57,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":190.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390800831,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-01T11:12:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554356,"name":"Ganga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganga is 24 years old.

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

In the city, he buys agricultural supplies such as seed, fertilizer, and pesticide that they use to control infestations, as well as other things such as basic household groceries. To get there he has to walk 4 kilometers from his house to the city, and the difficulty is that there are times when transportation is not very frequent for him to transport the purchases.

since she was a little girl, Shanikqu loved styling hair and dreamed of owning a salon.  \r\n \r\nAs soon as she graduated from high school in her hometown of Mesquite, Texas, she wasted no time at all and enrolled in cosmetology school. She knew this was a career she would love \u2013 and that it would also sustain her growing family for the long term.\r\n \r\nAt first, Shanikqu rented a chair in a local salon, earning money via a wage split with the salon owner.  However, she also earned commissions from her most loyal customers, and after several years of careful saving, she began to purchase her own equipment and supplies.  \r\n \r\nThen, at last, it was time to take that next step to achieve her dream of establishing her very own salon, and Accion Texas was there to help. Shanikqu was able to use her Accion Texas Inc. loan for working capital. In addition to purchasing her last bit of needed inventory, the loan funds were used to help pay for the initial costs of moving into a salon space.  \r\n \r\nShanikqu is now the proud owner of The

She is a mother of four children and is a responsible and hard-working housewife. \r\n\r\nFozia's husband sells cement sacks in the main market which is the only source of income for the family. However, his monthly net income is not enough to meet the household's needs.\r\n\r\nFozia has requested a loan for her husband in the amount of PKR 20,000 from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan. With the loan, her husband will purchase cement sacks to sell. By doing so, he will easily increase his net income and savings for the future. \r\n\r\nFozia is hopeful that the loan will be a productive one for her husband's business. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":218.25,"image":{"id":1341994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","use":"to purchase cement sacks for her husband to sell.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have 4 milk cows, 2 calves, a vineyard and plot of agricultural land.  The cows are milked every day to make dairy products. From the harvested grapes family makes wine and vodka. All the products are sold locally at the markets so the family gets a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nIuri requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Iuri has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Iuri will purchase chicks. He already has cages ready for them.

Ledi\u2019s husband is an artisan and he works on private orders for a small monthly salary. \r\n\r\nLedi was approved for a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. With her credit, Ledi will purchase all the needed materials to build a greenhouse where she will grow vegetables that will be sold at the local markets. Ledi will then be able to earn additional income for the family to improve their living conditions.

Her father and brother work as artisans, locally. Together, they make hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nRecently, Maia requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Maia has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up Loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith this credit, Maia will rent a commercial space and open a clothing shop.

is 21 years old. She lives in the small village of Sachkhere District with her parents and brother. Mariam requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milking cows and 0.75 hectare of agricultural land. They produce dairy products to sell locally. It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMariam requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Mariam has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

In December 1999, the city was named a World Heritage Site, based on its beautiful historic center. The friendly, gracious people still observe their cultural traditions. \r\n\r\nMarcela, one of the members, lives in the Totoracocha neighborhood in Cuenca. She likes the unity and fellowship that exists in her communal bank. Marcela is 42, married, and has three children, ages 20, 15, and 7, from her marriage. Her oldest son is in college; her second child, a girl, is also in college; and her youngest daughter studies in a local school. Her husband drives his own taxi. They live in their own house. \r\n\r\nMarcela does the housework and is always taking care of the children and her house.
