Dimas travels about 15 minutes on foot with his son every day between 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM to get to where his corn fields are.  \r\n\r\nDimas will use the loan to buy inputs (fertilizer, insecticide, and fungicide) for 7,000 square meters of corn as well as a calf to form a team with one he already has so he can work with them.  He hopes to have good harvests and a higher income to provide his family an adequate home and to pay off the loan. \r\n\r\nDimas's dreams and goals are, first, to have a good harvest, which is essential for his family, and to be able to educate his grandchildren.  The loan will be very helpful for Dimas because it will benefit his crops and increase his income, which will allow him to pay off the loan and, if he makes a profit, improve his very modest home.

The cooked jab\u00e9r\u00e9 is gotten 25 pieces at a time for 100 francs or more.\r\n\r\nThe profits earned enable her to augment her savings with the goal of further attending to her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase bananas and jab\u00e9r\u00e9 (wild yams) to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":4700,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saibatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ouleye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malado","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nafy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionfolo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mouskeba Nene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fansene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Diallo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":2260000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2260000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-27T14:59:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637192,"name":"Floresmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Floresmila tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el caser\u00edo de Ternique,ubicado en Morropon su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda a dos horas de la ciudad de Piura, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<P>\nElla se dedica a la venta de productos de belleza, brindando asesoramiento a sus clientes que en la mayor\u00eda son mujeres, ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 1 000 nuevos soles para la compra de ropa para damas y de esta manera hacer crecer su negocio, generando mayores ingresos para su familia.\n\n","en":"Floresmila is 36 years old.

She starts her day at five o'clock in the morning and walks to the local breweries to get her orders. She then makes her way to her shop and makes sure her drinks are displayed very well so that customers can choose to buy from her as there are a lot of people doing the same business. Mercy says in the six years she has been running her business, her profit margins have remained more or less the same.

She is married to Jose, a construction worker. She and Jose have children. They work hard to provide income for their family's living expenses and to manage their household. <p>\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, Yonisa operates a sales business. Specifically, she sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. Her customers' orders are purchased with cash by the dealer and then given to customers along with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in catalogs. Her regular customers are her neighbors and others in the local community. She typically earns a minimum of 2,000 PHP in sales every week. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 30,000 PHP. The loan proceeds would be used to buy additional supplies and merchandise, such as clothing, footwear, shampoo, cologne, deodorants, perfumes, soaps, fabric softeners, undergarments, and other products needed in her business. With help from the loan, Yonisa hopes that her business will expand because she dreams of providing her family with a better life. <p>\r\n\r\nEvery week she meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, Fatima, is located here. Seven enthusiastic women, whose average age is 42, formed the Fatima Trust Bank and live in this community. As is common in many indigenous rural areas in Guatemala, the ladies have been weavers since childhood. They sell their textiles in their own community as well as in surrounding areas. One of the women sells cosmetics and another sells snacks.\n\nAgripina, a married 55-year-old woman, works in textile production, mostly crafting beautiful typical skirts called \u201ccortes.\u201d She delivers to her clients each week and has two full-time employees. At this time, Agripina is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge that she will use to purchase a variety of good quality threads and yarn. Since the year-end holidays are quickly approaching, Agripina wants to fill existing orders as well as additional incoming orders.\n\nOne of her three children is starting college next year and this is motivating her to work diligently before the year ends so that she can have enough extra funds to help him with educational fees. A common goal among the women in Friendship Bridge Trust Banks is to have enough money so that their children can attend school, an opportunity that many of them missed. Agripina shares, \u201cI could only study for three years, but I will encourage my children to reach college. I will do my best to help them because I know that it is so important. Because of my business and the income it provides, I think this is a real possibility.\u201d\n\nThe seven women of the Fatima Trust Bank greatly appreciate the opportunity to receive this new financial capital for their businesses. Empowered with their funds and a little education on subjects like business management, family health and self-esteem, they are poised to realize a better life benefiting themselves, their families, and their community!\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.8,"image":{"id":1467222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy a variety of threads and yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":4050,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena Maria Lucrecia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena Imelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Agripina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2669},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2641}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.79},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.79},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.79},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.79},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.79},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.8,"local_amount":2669,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2673.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728425,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-29T22:08:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630553,"name":"Frank S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 55-year-old Frank.

lives in Kilifi, Kenya. He is 35 years old and he is married with one child. He is a motorcycle operator in Kilifi and he has been doing this business for one year now. He started the business from the savings he made over the years. The challenge he faces in this business is the high cost of fuel, which sometimes cuts into his income. He seeks a loan to buy another motorcycle.

In 1960 the camp was expanded onto a further 90 dunams.\r\n\r\nSameer thought of doing something to contribute to the family income, as his parents' income alone is not sufficient to fulfill the demands of all the family members. His life condition forced him to complete his secondary education. In 2005 he started sewing at a shop as an employee. After that he opened his own workshop after one year.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adoyia is a 44 year old woman from Iraq. She is married and the mother of four children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Adoyia is one of the many Iraqi women who work from home using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\n\nShe has 10 years experience with her small, home-based sewing business, and as an experienced seamstress she is constantly looking for opportunities to improve the services she can provide to her customers and generate more income. Her work is interrupted frequently by power cuts in her area. To overcome this challenge and be able to manage her work and time better, she would like to buy a small generator and also a new sewing machine. To be able to afford these purchases she is participating in a group loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq (RI-Iraq). \n\nRI-Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor, thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

good-natured and cheerful man, 48 years old. He is married and has four children. Kenja's sons are working in Russia doing construction and earning a good income. Every month they send some money to their parents. Kenja lives with his wife in a small house in a rural village. In order to feed his family, he also runs his own business. Kenja works on a collective farm and keeps livestock. He has some land. Some of his land is irrigated, but not all. Here, Kenja grows carrots, potatoes and grains. His wife helps him take care of and raise cattle. Since their plot of land is large, they also graze their cattle on it. The livestock business brings in a good income, so Kenja wants to expand the business by increasing his cattle herd. For this he turned to the Arvand to get a loan to buy cattle.

She also lives with her stepson, who works in the fields alongside her husband. She was never able to finish primary school because her family, which was of limited means, lacked the economic resources. Because her parents worked hard during her childhood and taught her how to work the land, 17 years ago they were able to give her a piece of land which has brought many blessings and a lot of happiness to her family.  By growing coffee they earn money they need to cover expenses they are faced with such as medicine (to some degree), clothing, and food.  Maria Concepci\u00f3n's coffee fields are three kilometers away, and are reached by walking or occasionally on an animal. A challenge she faces is the rising cost of inputs, which make the cost of transporting the product too high for her and her husband since they need to attend to their coffee crop.  They don\u2019t consider the competition a problem since the market is fixed.  For these reasons, today Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n has asked for a loan to buy agricultural supplies like fertilizers of various kinds and insecticides which will allow her to maintain her coffee crop.

In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":1479399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-11-28T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-27T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanchi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613971,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840439,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T16:20:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":638604,"name":"Fred","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fred is 37 years old and lives in Kasese, Uganda.

She is a head of household and has gotten her two children ahead with great effort. After separating from her husband, she started working independently selling products via catalog to her family members, friends and neighbors in the area. She does this activity in addition to the raising and selling of pigs, which she learned from her parents and which she does from her home. With both jobs she is able to generate enough income to pay for her household expenses and be able to provide her children with an education. Her perseverance, drive and tenacity have allowed her to overcome the difficulties that life has put in her way. With the love and motivation of her children she always comes out victorious with each and every one of her adversities. Right now, she is asking for the help of the loan in order to invest it in buying merchandise wholesale (cosmetics, body and facial creams, accessories, perfumes and more). This way, she will be able to stock up to satisfy the demand that increases with the Christmas season, when people consume her products more, enabling her to generate a better level of profit. Marlen says that she is interested in continuing to do her work with discipline and dedication. She is aware that her childrens' well being depends on it. She also dreams of having her own store where she can sell her products and generate more profitability to offer a better quality of life to her family.
