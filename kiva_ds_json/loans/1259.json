Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\u201cConsidering myself as a quite serious and ambitious person, knowing how education is important in the modern society, I made a certain research of all universities in Kyrgyzstan. On balance with all pros and cons, I decided for myself that I want to study at the American University of Central Asia. There are a couple of reasons which hit me upon the idea to study there, such as: quality of education, strong teaching staff, uncommon system to study compared with other local universities, an opportunity to get two diplomas, a possibility to create your own studying schedule and choose subjects in accordance with your interest and preferences. \r\n\r\nTo achieve my dream, I created an action plan. As a first step, I entered AUCA preparatory courses. Just in a half-year, I improved my TOEFL results from 430 to 519. My maths score\/knowledge also became much better. This experience gave me an opportunity to see how the process of studies flows in AUCA. \r\n\r\nAnother reason which attracts more students is financial aid. I would like to apply for Kiva loan, too, as it will help me to cover my tuition fees at

In the Philippines.The whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan.

He works as an employee at a farm in the region where he lives. There he milks the cows and cares for the pasturage. He learned this work when he was a boy, thanks to the teachings of his father, who did farm work all his life. In addition, and to supplement his income, he alternates his job with caring for his own dairy cattle, since he has three cows located on the little pasture of his family home. They produce approximately 50 liters of liquid a day, which he sells to neighbors and friends in the area. His effort, his entrepreneurial spirit, and his enthusiasm motivate him to continue seeking alternatives that will help him to advance. It is for this reason that he is applying for the loan, with which he wants to buy two dairy cows. With them, he will be able to increase his production and thus improve his revenue from sales. This will allow him to continue working to accomplish his dreams of progressing, acquiring his own farm with ample pastures to continue his business in a totally independent manner without having to pay more rent. In addition, he wants to have many cows so that his business is productive and profitable, and this will allow him to help with the family economy, improving the conditions and standards of

She is 47 years old and married. She has two children with her husband, who are both grown-up but still live with her. Her husband is a driver and she has worked making handicrafts for many years. She learned her trade in a dressmaking academy.\r\n\r\nAna has a small sewing workshop in her home, where she makes all kinds of clothing. She works on the bais of orders from individuals who require her services, and also sells different kinds of clothes from door to door, although she sells the majority of her wares in her own workshop.\r\n\r\nShe works every day from 6am to 10pm, and sometimes even later when she has orders to finish. She has been in this business for over 13 years, which helps her to move forwards. She is going to use this new loan to buy all kinds of clothing,  fabric, threads and other materials for dressmaking. She has been a member of the community bank since the beginning, and she likes it because of the help it always offers her.

She said that her job has made her become a dynamic woman, and ensures her family\u2019s life. She earns about 3,000,000 VND per month. Her family\u2019s total earnings amount to about 5,000,000 VND per month.\r\n\r\nHer challenge in life and work is a lack of capital for her scrap business, and a lack of money to pay for her children\u2019s education. Her dreams are to expand her business, to buy more equipment for her house, and that her children can be successful in life. This loan is one step to help her reach for her dreams. She has participated in SEDA's credit program since 2007. In this loan cycle, she would like to borrow 10,528,000 VND, to use in her retail scrap trading. She always wants to expand her business, improve her family\u2019s life, and save profits for her children's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90,"image":{"id":1466148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to

Tatiana's mother is a nurse; therefore she has work shifts that are fairly sacrificing. \r\n\r\nTo be able to help her family and have better opportunities to get ahead, she entered to study business administration in a private university, but for lack of money she had to abandon her degree. She works as the manager of an internet caf\u00e9, her salary barely covers the costs of her home.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she is studying the Superior Technical degree of Banking. She is applying for a loan to be able to finish her studies. She has already received work offers from banks, but the main obstacle for hiring her is the lack of an academic degree. When she obtains it she will be able to improve her economic income and help with the economic instability of her younger siblings and her mother."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":25.9,"image":{"id":1465096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to finish her studies in the Superior Technical program in Banking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":327,"posted_date":"2013-11-10T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-09T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selva Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":712,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.35},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28.93},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":29.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30.98},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.28},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32.53},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.87},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.5},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.59},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":25.9,"local_amount":25.44,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T23:47:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629806,"name":"Leong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leong is 48 years old and married.

She already took used microfinancing through Hope Ukraine and with their help she was able to increase her income one and a half times (to 3,000 hryvnia). \r\n\r\nThis winter the shopping center manager, where Svetlana's store is located, decided to turn off the heating to save money. On one hand, Svetlana's rent did not increase (as she will not have to pay for heating), on the other hand it will be very cold and not comfortable for the sales people, nor for the customers. Though, if Svetlana was selling at an open market space, it would be worse. Therefore, Svetlana hopes that the future change will not have much impact on her business. \r\n\r\nSvetlana would like to expand her business. She wants to increase the assortment of goods in order to attract more customers. Svetlana requests a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to purchase goods: Jeans, sweaters, jackets and skirts.

green house farming. Since her previous loan, her children bought a house nearby and build two greenhouses there. This contributed to increasing the income. Alexandra would like optimize her business processes. Currently she grows seedlings in one of the largest greenhouses. Doing this, she loses time for sowing. Alexandra would like to build a separate greenhouse for seedlings. This will help reduce the sowing time, and will mean receiving the harvest earlier and sell them for a better price. \r\n\r\nAlexandra requests a loan in the amount of 30,000 hryvnia to build greenhouses for seedlings, and also to purchase seeds, plastic film and fertilizer.

life, and in order to get success she has had to work a lot. When she got married, it was difficult for her and her husband to find work in the village and the family had financial difficulties. They lived together with their parents and decided to work with a traditional business, which their parents worked with all their lives: Growing vegetables. They began to make every effort to develop this business. \r\n\r\nThis entrepreneur is very hardworking and accurate, the house and the garden is always in order. However, in order to get the best results, she needs more investment. Therefore, on the advice of her friends, she asked for help from Hope Ukraine. Thanks to the previous loan, Natalya was able to install heating in two out of four of the greenhouses, which increased the income. Therefore, Natalya would like to install heating in the remaining two greenhouses this year, and install a new, powerful heater, which will heat all the greenhouses. This is Natalya's dream and she works diligently to realize her dream! \r\n\r\nNatalya requests a loan in the amount of 40,000 hryvnia for the heater and already this winter, the cold will not be intimidating. Natalya and her husband will be able to sow early seedlings and then the income will increase considerably.

Gabriela's father works as a teacher, and his salary is the family's primary source of income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1466512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":264,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":583,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.19},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-17T21:49:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630041,"name":"Juvy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvy is 45 years old, married, and has 3 adult children, She lives in Oyan,Sibutad Zamboanga del Norte.

hometown of Sukhumi (Georgia). In 1989, together with her family they had to leave this city and move to Ukraine in the Kamenka, Dneiper region. In Sukhumi a war had begun and because of this Oksana had to leave her home and homeland to save her children and forget the horrors of war. \r\n\r\nSome relatives had already settled in Kamenka, Ukraine and because of this it was not so difficult. \r\n\r\nThe first year was hard because they started with nothing. They started in agriculture and their life began to adjust. The family worked, built a greenhouse, and made new friends. Their relatives helped greatly. In this regard they are very friendly.

I believe that it is very important that you can choose the subjects which you need in your future profession and life. The second reason is that AUCA stands against corruption. AUCA values your diligence, desire to study and acquire knowledge; thereby this university provides professionals and experts that our country really needs. AUCA gives its students lots of opportunities. There are many different clubs, conferences, and events that help students to broaden their mind, to become more independent and help to build their personalities. Furthermore, AUCA has international cooperation with other colleges and universities, for example with Bard College, which means that AUCA can provide the possibility to earn a Masters Degree abroad. One of the opportunities that AUCA gives to its students is financial aid, which is very helpful.

of Georgia. It has already been 16 years since they came to Ukraine. Volodya has a wonderful partner in his wife, and they have five children. Volodya worked very hard to feed his family and save money for a good house, since he is after all, the head of the family. It took a while for them to be able to buy a house, and it was a joyful occasion. With the house came land, where Volodya now grows vegetables independently. First he planted tomatoes uncovered, but it didn't bring much profit. He then began to build large, permanent, arched greenhouses. The greenhouses are comfortable to work in, and harvest has significantly increased. Now it is time to think about heating, so Volodya is requesting a loan from Hope Ukraine to buy a complete boiler.
