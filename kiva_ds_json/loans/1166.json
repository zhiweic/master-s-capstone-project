started her daycare business, Heavenly Care Child Development Center, less than six months ago in Alexandria, Louisiana.  Latonya has more than three years of experience caring for children and has a short-term goal to earn profits from her business after six months.  To begin her business, Latonya used her savings to start but needed extra money to continue.  \r\n\r\nA current Accion Texas Inc. borrower informed Latonya about the nonprofit microlender and encouraged her to apply for a microloan.

Es un hombre soltero que vive en  Pastaza, un cant\u00f3n ubicado en la Provincia con el mismo nombre, perteneciente a la Regi\u00f3n Amaz\u00f3nica de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. La cabecera cantonal es la ciudad del Puyo una ciudad ubicada en medio de la selva amaz\u00f3nica al occidente de la provincia de Pastaza y a 924 m. sobre el nivel del mar. Es demogr\u00e1ficamente peque\u00f1a pero tiene una gran variedad de sitios que son los preferidos para turistas nacionales e internacionales sobre todo los de actividades ecol\u00f3gicas y de deportes extremos. Una ciudad que crece econ\u00f3micamente cada d\u00eda por las actividades de comercio, ganader\u00eda, agricultura y turismo, por lo que en ella se han establecido sucursales de empresas financieras y comerciales que pretenden aprovechar la actividad econ\u00f3mica que mantiene esta peque\u00f1a ciudad. En cada negocio se encuentra personas que no se han dado por vencidas frente a la falta de empleo sino que han emprendido con sus ideas de negocio para llevar una vida digna y hacer realidad sus sue\u00f1os.\nSergio luego de adquirir algo de experiencia en el comercio decidi\u00f3 establecer su propio negocio en su ciudad, se trata de la venta de llantas y repuestos de veh\u00edculos que lo ejerce desde hace 15 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 gracias a un primo quien le ayud\u00f3 con los contactos de proveedores y adem\u00e1s lo motiv\u00f3 a emprender con esta actividad. Ahora invierte al menos 5 horas en la atenci\u00f3n del local, pero se complica y se extiende la jornada laboral cuando tiene que hacer cobranzas con sus clientes, pues no todos pagan de contado y puntualmente. Sin embargo, Sergio ha aprendido herramientas que le ayudan a administrar mejor su negocio, gracias a la asesor\u00eda del ejecutivo de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en donde ahora solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 variedad de repuestos al por mayor, formando parte de las promociones y mayores descuentos que los proveedores ofrecen a las compras mayores. En anteriores ocasiones, Sergio no pudo obtener el capital por no poseer las altas garant\u00edas que le exig\u00edan en algunas instituciones, pero gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa que a trav\u00e9s de su producto de Kiva pueden dar una mano a emprendedores microempresarios y de zonas rurales; \u00e9l podr\u00e1 hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de tener una microempresa y con las ganancias poder retomar sus estudios y prepararse en el \u00e1rea comercial y financiera. ","en":"Sergio is 29 years old and has learned to always get ahead thanks to the example of his parents.  He has always worked in commercial jobs since his charisma helps him a lot with sales.  He started to work when he finished secondary school since his family had started to have financial problems that did not allow him to go to university and he wanted to help with the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHe is a single man who lives in Pastaza, a canton located in the Pastaza province, which is located in the Amazon region of Ecuador.  The capital of the canton is the city of Puyo, which is a city located in the middle of the Amazon jungle on the western side of the province of Pastaza, and 924 meters above sea level. The city has a small population, but it has a large variety of sites that draw Ecuadorian and international tourists, including ecological activities and extreme sports.  The city grows economically every day from commerce, livestock, agriculture, and tourism activities.  Branches of financial and commercial companies have been established there to take advantage of the economic activity that supports this small city.  In each business, there are people who have not given up on the lack of jobs but have come up with ideas for businesses so that they can live a decent life and realize their dreams.\r\n\r\nAfter Sergio acquired some sales experience, he decided to start his own business in the city.  He sells tires and spare parts for vehicles.  He has done this for 15 years, and learned thanks to a cousin to helped him with the contracts for vendors and motivated him to start this business.  Now, he spends at least five hours at the shop each day, but his day is made longer when he has to make collections from his customers since not everyone pays in cash and on time.  \r\n\r\nSergio has learned tools that help him administer his business better thanks to the advice from Fundacion Alternativa.  Now he is requesting a loan to purchase a variety of spare parts at wholesale.  This will allow him to take advantage of promotions and better discounts that vendors offer for wholesale purchases.  Previously, Sergio was not able to get a loan because he did not have the high guarantees that those institutions request.  Thanks to Fundacion Alternativa through their product with Kiva, they can give a hand to small business owners in rural areas so that Sergio can make his dream of having a small business a reality.  With his earnings, he can go back to school and study business and finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1388023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase tires and spare parts at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pastaza","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1023.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":505.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":518.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.98},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":519.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":505.98,"local_amount":505.24,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":505.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565430,"comment":null},{"amount":519.02,"local_amount":518.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":519.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814467,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-14T19:04:35Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582961,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":181.63,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy furniture (tables and chairs) for their business.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":698.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:11:35Z","rounded_local_amount":717.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390798838,"comment":null},{"amount":89.95,"local_amount":685.35,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":703.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410086493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-19T16:29:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582967,"name":"Maria Magdalena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda,  requiere de un nuevo  pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en el negocio que desempe\u00f1a; este le permitir\u00e1 comprar la materia prima necesaria tales como: tierra de barro, nacazcol, le\u00f1a, transporte y pago de mano de obra.\nEl cr\u00e9dito anterior fue de mucha ayuda,  las condiciones econ\u00f3micas han mejorado, ya que lo invirti\u00f3 en el negocio y apoyo para su familia; el n\u00facleo familiar se mantiene.\n","en":"Maria needs a new loan to invest in the work she does.

She belongs to a poor family, as her whole family is fully dependent upon a single earning person and a single source of income as well. Her husband has owned a small general store in a nearby hometown for 12 years.\r\n\r\nHer husband is facing a problem with his daily sales and is unable to fulfill the demands of his daily customers due to a shortage of stock. The causes of the shortage of those inventories are that Sobia herself uses all of her household necessities from her husband's general store, and because most of the customers like to buy commodities on a credit basis.\r\n \r\nSobia wants to fill the requirements of stock in her husband's general store, and that is why she requested a loan, so that her husband would be able to buy those inventories. Sobia hopes that this loan will bring positive changes to the general store so that she can manage her household expenses through earned income. She is very happy and glad after taking this loan, and she is very thankful to BRAC Pakistan.\r\n\r\nNote: Sobia is raising her hand in the picture.

Her partner is Boni, a construction worker. She and her partner manage their household while operating the business. She works hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. Jovy operates a food stall. \r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only in the evenings, when all the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two people while when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. \r\n\r\nJovy\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day. To help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more ingredients, such as meat, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.\r\n\r\nJovy hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life. Every week, she goes to meetings with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":670.83,"image":{"id":1387452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for ingredients, including rice, pork, chicken, vegetables and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T15:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T15:20:08Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jovy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":6326.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534943,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6326.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784339,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771325,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":11249.99,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":11387.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429478243,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T09:36:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582428,"name":"Corazon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Corazon is 41 years old, married, and has five children, one of whom is in school.

She is a single mom with two children. She manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to provide income for her everyday expenses. Ester operates an LPG business. What she basically does is buy tanks of liquefied petroleum gas from wholesalers and then sell them by the tank at a small profit. \r\n\r\nLPG tanks can range from small to regular sized tanks. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. To help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a PHP 40,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more stocks of LPG tanks to expand her product inventory.

actividad que aprendi\u00f3 de su difunto padre por lo cual \u00e9l se siente orgulloso de desarrollar esta actividad, adem\u00e1s de tener en cuenta que la clientela que mantiene es muy grande porque no solamente abarca el cant\u00f3n sino que \u00e9l se desplaza a los cantones aleda\u00f1os o cercanos al que le reside.  \n\nLos productos los adquiere en la ciudad; por lo que tiene que desplazarse m\u00e1s de 54 kil\u00f3metros, distancia que recorre en el transporte colectivo, los productos los compra en los diferentes almacenes de esta ciudad en algunos le dan precios bajos porque compra al mayoreo. Para comprar, los mariscos se tiene que desplazar hasta la playa el cuco que se encuentra a 25 minutos de donde \u00e9l vive dicha actividad comercial la realiza 2 veces por semana.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, es para comprar m\u00e1s art\u00edculos de cocina y mariscos; ya que por la cantidad de clientela que \u00e9l tiene muchas veces se queda sin producto para poder satisfacer las necesidades de sus clientes adem\u00e1s quiere reparar parte de la vivienda donde reside; por que se encuentra la parte trasera de esta en un estado de deterior\u00f3 muy alto al punto que la pared est\u00e1 a punto de caerse y quiere mitigar ese riesgo en su vivienda.\n\nUna de las primeras necesidades en satisfacer es la obtenci\u00f3n de ingresos a la familia adem\u00e1s de asegurar un mejor bienestar para su familia ya que con la reparaci\u00f3n de la pared \u00e9l podr\u00e1 omitir en totalidad el riesgo que actualmente corren con la pared en mal estado, adem\u00e1s otra de las necesidades a satisfacer son los nuevos productos que podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus clientes ya que muchos de ellos le piden art\u00edculos que por falta de dinero no puede conseguir. \n\nEntre sus planes esta, construir una vivienda m\u00e1s segura; ya que actualmente en la que residen est\u00e1 un poco deteriorada por el paso del tiempo, adem\u00e1s el sue\u00f1a con una familia con ingresos estables, con mejores oportunidades de educaci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar una peque\u00f1a canoa ya que donde el reside se encuentra a unos pocos metros la laguna de OLOMEGA, para poder pescar y poder incrementar sus ingresos.\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Julio is single and 34 years old. He is well known in the community as a responsible young man with good values. He sells seafood, kitchen items, household appliances, and more as a traveling salesperson. He has been doing this work for more than 20 years, an activity he learned from his late father which is why he is proud to be cultivating this work. In addition, he has a large clientele because he not only covers the canton but travels to surrounding or nearby cantons to where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies in the city so he has to travel more than 54 kilometers, a distance he makes by public transport, buying products in various stores in the city where some of them give him lower prices for buying in bulk.\r\n\r\nTo buy the seafood he goes to the beach which by the clock is about 25 minutes away from where he lives, a trip he makes twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting through Fundaci\u00f3n Camp is to buy more kitchen items and seafood because he has so many customers that sometimes he does not have the products they need and he also wants to make repairs to his home where he lives. The back part is in such a high state of deterioration that the wall is on the point of collapsing and he wants to mitigate that risk to his home.\r\n\r\nOne of the first needs to satisfy is to obtain family earnings while ensuring a better quality of life for his family because by repairing the wall he will be able to entirely remove the risk they run with the wall in a bad state. Also, another need to satisfy is buying new products so he can offer his customers what many of them ask for which he can\u2019t get without money. \r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to build a more secure home, as currently where they live has somewhat deteriorated over time, he dreams of having stable family income, and better opportunities for education. He also hopes to buy a little canoe as he lives close to the Olomega lagoon, in order to fish and be able to increase his earnings."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1388139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more kitchen items and seafood to sell in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-07-14T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-13T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2015-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2015-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.83},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.96},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.48},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.78},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.51},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582393,"name":"Shabana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabana is a 36-year-old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

lives in the Nkubu area of Eastern Kenya, a very fertile area for agriculture situated along the slopes of Mt.Kenya. She is married and has three children. She has practiced farming for 20 years. Her income is from growing maize, cabbages, potatoes and bananas.\r\n\r\nShe wants to venture into raising rabbits, so she has requested a loan of KES 40,000 to undertake that project.

He is in a relationship and has three children. For the last 7 years he has been a businessman, particularly in car sales. It was his older brother who taught him the business. Before, he was a labourer. He travels all over the eastern area of the country looking for business or cars that will make a profit.\r\n \r\nThe loan he is asking for through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, will give him working capital for a business opportunity, as day-to-day there is a market of opportunities. But on this occasion Ricardo will invest in buying kitchen pans to sell and he has already found a provider who is offering them at a good price and a profit is assured.\r\n\r\nJust like that, he will have a new business which Ricardo hopes will generate a large profit and so when car sales are down, he will compensate with the income from selling kitchen pans. As such, he will have an extra source of income which will help to look after his family and the household expenses. \r\n\r\nRicardo's future plans include his children studying so that they can become professionals.

Yanina works every day, starting early in the morning, and for appoximately 10 hours.  She likes her work and believes that she is doing well at it because of her good job performance and because of the friendly way in which she treats others.  Yanina is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help she will be able to  buy a stove.  She currently prepares food on a wood-burning stove, which is dangerous for her to use.

She is a very friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic person.  She and her husband devote all of their efforts to raising their family.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources and because she had to start working at a young age to help her parents, Tezzy was not able to study business administration as she would have liked.  In her free time she likes to cook delicious Peruvian rice dishes called \"juanes\" to share with her family.  On her own initiative, and with great effort and dedication, Tezzy works in her own small business selling cakes and a variety of snacks.  She gets up very early every day to make cookies, appetizers, cakes and other snacks that her customers request.  Tezzy works approximately 12 hours per day, serving about 20 customers. She believes that her business is doing well because of her tasty products and because of the friendly way that she treats others.  Tezzy is very grateful to Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help she will be able to buy a larger quantity and variety of ingredients, such as bags of flour, sugar, sweets, raisins, cake-making materials and other things.  With this, Tezzy can continue working in order to achieve her great dream, which is to see her children become successful professionals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":241.39,"image":{"id":1388771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients and materials for a cake shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-07-15T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-14T04:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tezzy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98.36},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":115.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":122.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":138.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":148.76},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.54},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.07,"local_amount":98.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":99.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776427,"comment":null},{"amount":37.56,"local_amount":102.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-18T08:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":104.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779382,"comment":null},{"amount":39.13,"local_amount":106.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":108.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054578,"comment":null},{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":112.82,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":114.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819475,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":115.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":117.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472419,"comment":null},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":122.07,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":123.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694897,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-25T16:20:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582588,"name":"Alex","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alex is a hardworking man who does his best to meet the target needs of his family.

","en":"Hamida is an educated woman who lives in Rudaki. She is 39 years old, married and has three children. Hamida has a college degree and works as a teacher at the local school. Since her salary is too small toprovide for her family, Hamida has decided to start her own business. The hot summer is the season for selling watermelons and cantaloupes. Hamida analyzed the market and decided to sell these fruits. She has already purchased a market stall and she has a starting capital of 4000 somoni, which were sent by her husband, a migrant worker in Russia.

is a 55-year-old married man. There are five people at his home and Mammadaga is the only person who takes care of his family's financial needs. His wife stays at home always being a housewife. \r\n\r\nYears ago, Mammadaga decided to open his own business, selling the basic grocery items needed in his neighborhood. Today, he is a person who enjoys his neighbors' and family's respect.\r\n\r\nHe has been in this business for 10 years. He sells food products in his shop, such as macaroni, rice, candies, cookies, sugar and beverages. His wife helps him in this business. His monthly profit is 150 AZN. As this is the main source of income, his profit is used for family needs.
