And because of the start of the new school year, Manal wants to help her husband in paying the cost of purchasing printer ink that schools and associations request and purchase.  Manal is requesting a USD loan from Faten for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes this project is that it is located next to many schools in the area where they live. Taking this loan will increase sales and improve the family's income, which will enable them to live in better conditions.\r\n\r\nManal and her husband are looking to expand the bookstore in the future and have a special space for selling printer ink.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":748.05,"image":{"id":1217025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"to

He is not married and lives with his parents. Nuriddin is attending the university so that he can receive a bachelor's degree in finance. In his spare time he drives a taxi and also sells watermelons and cantaloupes when they are in season. Nuriddin's father works at a currency exchange shop and his mother is a home maker. Nuriddin does not want to rely on his parent's savings to provide for his education but feels that it is his responsibility to finance his education independently. This year Nuriddin was admitted to the university and, after consulting with his parents, deiced to turn to Arvand for a loan. His parents have agreed to the loan because they do not have enough savings to pay for the education of their son.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1218542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal

middle-aged woman who is an English teacher by profession. She works in a local school and has many years of experience. Her husband is a licensed doctor who practices in a local hospital. Because workers who are paid from the public purse receive small salaries that barely cover living expenses, those residents living in rural areas also raise cattle. Qambaroi and her husband have kept cattle at home for more than 20 years. This is a very opportune situation for the family at this time, since Qambaroi's son and daughter-in-law have gone to Russia to earn money to help their parents, just as many of their peers do. However, Qambaroi tries not to use their money, saving it to build a house instead. Now she has found out about MDO Arvand and has come for financial assistance to buy several more head of cattle to increase her herd. Qambaroi is hoping to earn a good income and to co-operate with us for a long time.

She chose this activity because she wanted to help her children since she has two little ones she cares for and which is why she is unable to work in a firm.  The work\u2019s independent and the research she did made her feel it was profitable so she started selling under another person\u2019s code but this wasn\u2019t very helpful for her because the person who won the rewards for volume sales was her girlfriend.  When she was able to gather together money to capitalize herself she approached the firm and registered with her own code number.\r\n\r\nShe works alone on her routes visiting customers either to collect payment or to take orders.  Her normal schedule is 9 to 11 in the morning and then again from 3pm-5pm.  She takes this break in order to be return home to care for her children.  Martha sells such things as perfume, make-up, lipstick, etc. that she buys; her profit margin is 30%.  \r\n\r\nShe lives in Duran and is divorced.  She will use the loan to buy products like perfume, make-up, clothes and shoes to sell hoping to obtain better results.

Her children are not living in the area at the moment, as they are attending higher education courses thanks to the support provided by herself and her husband. Dina lives with Cayo, her husband, in a wooden house. She engages in growing cocoa in the plots of land she inherited form her parents 30 years ago. Cayo, who has the situation always under control, supports her with everything that is needed, as he knows that team works will repay them both better in the end.\r\nNow that the harvest season is over, Dina needs to provide full maintenance to her plots of land to protect them form a disease called \u201cSeca-Seca\u201d, and it can be a very devastating blight if not sopped with the proper means. For this reason she sees herself obliged to substitute some cocoa plantations on a vast scale, and she plans on hiring daily laborers who will carry out this job as well as give the respective manure to the cocoa trees, thus optimizing the production.\r\nWhile she works she always thinks about her children, to whom she offers all the economic support they need in hope to see them completing their professional studies and becoming economic independent in the future. This is her third loan with MFP, and she is grateful to the institution for trusting her. She commits to always complying with the repayment of her dues, as she has always greatly benefited from the other loans she has received. She also says that she likes being a member of her Communal Bank because she feels more confident and she gets more information on receiving benefits when staying in a group.\r\nThe 2,500 PER she is requesting will be used to hire daily laborer to extract the infected trees and to buy nursery trees to replace the infected one, as well as to buy manure to grant herself an adequate production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1218265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy nursery plants, manure and to pay for daily labors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-20T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-19T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":267.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":291.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":301.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":297.52},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":321.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":331.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":336.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":351.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.79},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.03},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.22},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.5,"local_amount":267.96,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":270.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053677,"comment":null},{"amount":113.79,"local_amount":291.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":294.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188614,"comment":null},{"amount":117.53,"local_amount":301.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572526,"comment":null},{"amount":116.03,"local_amount":297.52,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":300.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122186,"comment":null},{"amount":125.22,"local_amount":321.07,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":323.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868012,"comment":null},{"amount":129.34,"local_amount":331.63,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":334.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364576871,"comment":null},{"amount":131.33,"local_amount":336.76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":339.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529209,"comment":null},{"amount":137.26,"local_amount":351.94,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":355.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974353,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-21T12:30:19Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484785,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella is from Tabuan, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

Shortly after they moved out on their own, they started leasing a wooden house.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of his father, he was able to purchase his own parcel of land.  Since he is a hardworking young man, for the past two years he has been making a living through agriculture - specifically the production of coffee and cocoa - due to its high demand.  Luz, who is a great support to him, is constantly helping him with basic tasks, and they have been a united team in the face of the hard work of the countryside.  He clearly appreciates her very much.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing his land, he was surprised to find that there are a number of cocoa trees at the end of their lifecycle, and it is now necessary to replant the land so that the space is not wasted and the land capacity is maximized.  For this reason, he needs to buy seedlings in bulk quantities, as well as grafts.  Among his skills, he learned to make his own organic fertilizer made of plants and fertile soil, which he is also thinking of selling in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan that will allow him to work with more confidence.

is Elizabeth, 59, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm-sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw materials like fabric, thread and other items needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes her business grows and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business .

He is married to a farmer and they have five children between 5 and 20. All of his children attend schools. \r\n\r\nHe has been a maize farmer for 10 years. He wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and seed and to support labor costs. He plans to use the profits to pay school fees and make savings.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is 47. She is married to a businessman. She has five children, aged between 6 and 19.  All of her children attend schools. She has been a maize farmer for 15 years. She wants a Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and support labor costs. The profits from the business will be used to beautify, clean, and create a friendly environment at her home.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

is a 43 year-old man, an internally displaced person who lives in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and two children.

He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every table in an Azerbaijan family and also are used in fresh punch. He usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 100 AZN.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Qafar wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose, he applied for 1900 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

The couple cover the child related expenses between them. K\u00e8mi hardly went to school herself. For nearly six years, she has been a trader of condiments and to a lesser extent of charcoal, based at her home. K\u00e8mi is passionate about this business, which allows her to cover her own expenses and those of her children. She buys her products at a market in B\u00e9nin. \r\nIn order to satisfy customer demand, she is seeking a first loan together with the other members of the AYITCHEME 1 group. This loan will allow them to meet the demand from their customers and also to generate more profit for themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1220033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy condiments and sacks of charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2012-10-20T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-19T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"K\u00e8mi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gis\u00e8le","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Albertine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antoinette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roseline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eve","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hounyov\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afiwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ang\u00e8le","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeconou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" P\u00e9lagie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noelie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A.

She sells electronic products. For 10 years, Svetlana and her husband ran a business together. Initially, they rented their premises but later got the opportunity to buy quite a big store, and their business took off. However, a year ago, Svetlana divorced her husband because of his infidelity, and he took the store from her. \r\n\r\nSvetlana has now started over. She is renting new premises and sells electronics independently. She wants to stock her shop with goods in order to meet the demands of her customers. She is hard-working and has set herself big goals. Svetlana is asking for a loan of 22,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia to buy notebook computers and telephones. She will use the income generated to increase the range of goods she sells and to improve her sales outlet.
