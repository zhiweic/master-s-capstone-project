She is seeking the loan in order to pay for licensing and registration requirements so that she may practice her profession; otherwise she would not have any other choice but to wait until next year to see whether there may be financial resources to cover it. Practicing her profession is very important to her because it is an income source for her and her family, and also is of far-reaching significance in the nation's legal field.

This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, as this allows her to have peace of mind and to move forward with her plans for her business.  She also promises to make her payments on time.  She gets along well with the members of her communal bank, all of whom are very supportive.  With the requested 1,500 soles, she will buy construction materials to begin to expand her rooms and improve conditions in them in order to offer her tenants a better service.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1189794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy materials to build more rooms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":230.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":227.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":247.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":257.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":261.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.45},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.45,"local_amount":230.75,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":230.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452372,"comment":null},{"amount":87.13,"local_amount":227.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":227.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447553,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":247.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":247.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053451,"comment":null},{"amount":98.54,"local_amount":257.06,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":257.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188376,"comment":null},{"amount":100.26,"local_amount":261.55,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":261.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572307,"comment":null},{"amount":105.62,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":275.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121966,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T10:44:34Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471310,"name":"Mayflor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mayflor, 23, is single and lives with her parents.

She is a hard working and enterprising woman, happy and charismatic. She is married to Lucio who is a teacher, and they have 3 children, Leyder, Patricia and Elar of 26, 23, and 21 years of age respectively, living in their own house which they managed to buy through their many efforts.\r\n\r\nGilda sells food, from a menu with extra dishes, in a small facility that she adapted in her own home, where she put the tables and chairs needed to accommodate her customers, with delicious dishes, with good homemade flavors that she learned from her mother, earning the appreciation of her clients. She also sews undergarments in the evenings, winning many clients through her good service. She started her business more than six years ago, and has an assistant helping whom she pays monthly. \r\n\r\nShe likes her work because she has an income that helps her husband with the household expenses, because many times the earnings of her husband as an employee of a private entity was not enough, so she decided to start her business. On the other hand she does not like it because she is exhausted at the end of each working day. But that does not discourage her and she continues working wanting to get ahead. This is why she has plans to grow her business, improving the atmosphere and varying the dishes, and also she wants to sell vegetables in front of her house.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan through MFP. She feels happy and grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit so that she can get ahead in her business, and thus she agrees to complete payment of the loans as she has with previous ones. Furthermore, she feels comfortable with the communal group that she is a member of as she considers them to be responsible and committed people with their obligations. With the requested amount of 2600 soles she will invest in the purchase of ingredients for the preparation of food, such as rice, oil, beans and other items searching for low prices in order to have higher profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1189757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, oil, and beans for the delicious homemade food she prepares in her home-based business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-15T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-15T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":392.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":414.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":413.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":445.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":462.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":471.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.13},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":151.13,"local_amount":392.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":394.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452370,"comment":null},{"amount":159.48,"local_amount":414.63,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":416.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447551,"comment":null},{"amount":158.87,"local_amount":413.07,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":414.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053449,"comment":null},{"amount":171.35,"local_amount":445.5,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":447.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188374,"comment":null},{"amount":177.74,"local_amount":462.12,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":463.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572305,"comment":null},{"amount":181.43,"local_amount":471.73,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":473.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121964,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T00:49:32Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471312,"name":"Sat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sat, 47, lives in Dambae, a rural area in Kampong Cham District, Cambodia.

There she begins the day cleaning her work instruments to then wait for customers to give good, attractive haircuts to men and modern cuts to women. She is the owner of two stands; in one of them there is a worker whom she hired, and she works in the other one.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for 21 years. She considers her business profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.\r\n\r\nIn the market where she works, she is very well known, since she is a charismatic woman and is always working for the rights of her fellow market vendors, who love her very much and know her as a hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nShe likes her work for having the freedom of time.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilyn hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

She began with a loan from MFP more than a year ago and tends her business alone, serving her customers in a cordial manner. From time to time, she also makes decorations for children's parties. She feels that her business is profitable because of the good earnings that it gives her.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be at home and care for her little children, whom she loves very much, in addition to having the economic income to pay the household expenses. On the other hand, she doesn't like it when it rains a lot, since it is difficult for her to sell her products, since she depends a lot on the weather to improve her sales. But this does not discourage her, and she has plans to continue and to increase the variety of her products. This is her 12th loan from MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have a loan so that she can complete her goals. On her part, she promises to be on time with her payments and thus stay on good terms with the group (communal bank) she belongs to, since they are all very responsible and very good.\r\n\r\nOf the 1400 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest it all in the purchase of soft drinks and candies of various brands and flavors to have a ready stock for sale, seeking lower prices by making her purchases for cash and in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1189826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy soft drinks and various brands of candies for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":215.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":212.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":231.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":240.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":244.26},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":256.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":84.66,"local_amount":215.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":220.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452375,"comment":null},{"amount":83.38,"local_amount":212.25,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":217.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447556,"comment":null},{"amount":90.92,"local_amount":231.43,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":237.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053454,"comment":null},{"amount":94.31,"local_amount":240.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":246.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188379,"comment":null},{"amount":95.96,"local_amount":244.26,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":250.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572310,"comment":null},{"amount":100.77,"local_amount":256.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":262.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T22:57:00Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471341,"name":"Iluminada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iluminada, 56 years old, is a patient mother with three children who are presently working and have own families.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She mainly offers food for breakfast. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nFlorence dreams to have a good life through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant.

Her business has grown and now has many customers and an assortment of products.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting her second loan from ODEF in the amount of 15,000 HNL.  The money will be used to buy products that she needs for her salon so that she can perform her work such as dyes, nail polishes, shampoo, cr\u00e8mes, make-up, and other supplies.  Her dream is to grow her business and become recognized.

Because of this big household, she has struggled to provide for her children's basic needs, with rice cultivation being the main source of income. To supplement the family's income, she also raises pigs at home while her husband works for others for a fee and produces palm-sugar to sell. \r\n\r\nHaving been in this business for several years, she is able to make about 23,500 KHR per day. Rom took her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner) one cycle ago and completely paid back the loan. The previous loan has helped her to grow her cash-crop and to better support her household especially paying for her children's education. \r\n\r\nNow, she is applying for a second-cycle loan with an amount of 1,000,000 KHR.

Thanks to her experience in this area and her warm welcome and rapport with the locals, she has been able to build up a very large customer base. \r\n\r\nThe constant increase in Minette\u2019s customer base means that supply is lower than demand, and loans are therefore important for her business. Thanks to these loans she has been able to buy basic goods (a box of soap, bag of rice, box of sugar and cubes), which will allow her to easily satisfy her customers, increase her sales and have a higher profit margin. Minette plans to reinvest part of her profits in her business, while the rest will allow her to provide for her family, for which she is responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1194895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To buy basic goods (a box of soap, bag of rice, box of sugar and cubes).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Yaound\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20683},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21468},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22253},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23038},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23823},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":24608},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25392},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26177},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26962},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27747},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28532},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29317}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.22},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.37,"local_amount":20683,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":21098.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914928,"comment":null},{"amount":42.93,"local_amount":21468,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":21898.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047162,"comment":null},{"amount":44.51,"local_amount":22253,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":22699.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436956,"comment":null},{"amount":1.35,"local_amount":674,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":687.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989374,"comment":null},{"amount":92.37,"local_amount":46187,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":47113.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622986,"comment":null},{"amount":377.47,"local_amount":188735,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":192522.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842197,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T12:22:55Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T08:58:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471369,"name":"Geofrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geofrey is a 46-year-old married man.

She hopes this loan will enable her to increase her pig-raising business and also hopes to feed her pigs to be fat and healthy so as to sell them for a good price to gain more income to improve her family's living condition. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1192967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy piglets for raising.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Ek Phnom district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T11:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T11:20:01Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1600000},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118851,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":202750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265926,"comment":null},{"amount":320,"local_amount":1280000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1297600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197290,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":405500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373046595,"comment":null},{"amount":300,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1216500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942028,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T13:43:30Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:54:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471392,"name":"Viviana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Viviana is 56 years old with four children.

She lives with her husband and five children in a village of the Ratanak Mondul district of Battambang province, Cambodia. All of her children are dependent and still in school. To make a living, she has grown corn for ten years. Chanthou is able to earn about 20,000 KHR per day and manages to save about 6,000 KHR each day after deducting daily expenses. Drought is the main challenge for her paddy-field business.\r\n\r\nShe has been with VisionFund for four cycles while the other members have been with VisonFund for five cycles.

She is a widow and mother to two children, one of whom is a student at a local public school in the community.

She can make about KHR 33,000 per day from the current business that she has been with for 25 years. Her main challenge is lack of water supply for her rice field.

Low crop yield has been the main challenge for her rice farming business. \r\n\r\nSokun\u2019s group consists of three members who are all females. This is the third micro-loan for Sokun with VisionFund. The past loans have helped her relieve the family's financial burden and better support her family. Now, she and her group members are requesting a loan with VisionFund of KHR 800,000 each. As the leader, she is will use her portion to buy fertilizers and rice seeds for her farmland.

She has three dependent children. She has farmed rice on one hectare of farmland for ten years and has been involved in growing beans to supplement her family\u2019s income for several years. The current business earns her approximately 25,000KHR per day and manages her to save about 10,000KHR each day after offsetting daily expenses for future needs.\r\n\r\nSoma has been with VisionFund for one cycle while the other member is just the first cycled client with VisionFund.

He acquires from 10 to 15 sheep in order to carry out this business. While his wife deals with caring for the animals, Juan handles the farm work. Thus, this self-sacrificing man works in coordination with his wife to save money and cover their basic needs.\r\n\r\nThis time, Juan wants to purchase more sheep and to do so he needs help. This is his seventh loan from MFP and he promises to make all of his payments on time. He also notes that he enjoys working with his communal bank, \u201cMirando un Futuro Mejor\u201d where he shares the same interests with others. He will use the S\/. 1,000 to purchase ten skinny rams to fatten and later sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1190033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy ten rams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1043.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-16T17:49:54Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469979,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda cuenta tiene 32 a\u00f1os  se dedica a  la venta de comida ella realiza esta actividad desde horas. 17:00 a 21:00 todos los d\u00edas, ella vive con sus hermanos mayores trabaja para costear sus costos propios ella no cuenta con familia ( esposo e hijos) es soltera vive en casa familiar en la zona de Santiago en la ciudad de El Alto, el dinero del cr\u00e9dito lo utilizara en la compra de insumos para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus comidas como arroz, fideo, papa y aceite en cantidad, ya que esta \u00e9poca empiezan a subir los insumos y desea tener almacenado para que no le falte.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 32 years old.

Besides helping in the rice field, Mean\u2019s husband also helps with a pig-raising business. For this couple, their main challenge is the insufficient water supply for her paddy field. \r\n\r\nIncluding this cycle, Mean has joined VisionFund (Kiva's partner) for two cycles. With success, she has paid back the entire first loan which has helped her to afford working capital to buy fertilizer for her rice farm and additional pigs to raise. Also, she has received a decent income from her business. Now she forms a group of four female members; three members, including her, are in the second-cycle seeking 1,200,000 KHR each while a remaining fellow group member is in the fourth-cycle applying for 500,000 KHR. As the group leader, Mean will use her loan portion to buy more fertilizer and to pump water for her farm. She also will use a portion of it to buy pig feed.

He will then be able to improve his income and his family's quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1190124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy merchandise to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":61.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":68.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":72.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":74.36},{"due_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":88.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":91.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":95.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":99.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.39},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.74},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.72,"local_amount":61.8,"processed_date":"2012-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":64.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315345560,"comment":null},{"amount":27.39,"local_amount":68.47,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":71.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954763,"comment":null},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":72.52,"processed_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":75.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331089169,"comment":null},{"amount":29.74,"local_amount":74.36,"processed_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":77.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339478717,"comment":null},{"amount":30.98,"local_amount":77.46,"processed_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031398,"comment":null},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355775900,"comment":null},{"amount":33.67,"local_amount":84.19,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364482715,"comment":null},{"amount":71.9,"local_amount":179.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":187.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381663746,"comment":null},{"amount":119.24,"local_amount":298.09,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":311.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410053892,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T18:30:50Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T11:13:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":469965,"name":"Lesvi Lizeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lesvi tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera, tiene 3 hijos y vive en Puerto Cortes.

In the city, she was able to find employment at different businesses and she also married and had 3 children, but when the father of her children left her,  she was left alone to care for them. And so, she worked for free for 3 months for a woman just for food for herself and her children, but she also learned to sew, which allowed her to get a job as a seamstress for more than 20 years. Now, she has the advantage of having her oldest child who has a job and helps her to maintain her home and her other 2 children, and this has helped her to improve the quality of life at home. But because of health problems, Olivia has been obligated to quit her job, but because she needs to still earn an income, she has decided to open her own sewing business from home with her basic machine and in this way be able to work a little bit at a time. Because she doesn't have a lot of money to invest in her new business, she is looking for a loan to purchase fabric and thread to start her own clothing line. Her dream is to be able to enjoy good health and to continue to work and for her 3 children to be successful, to give them a better quality of life and access to quality education for her 2 youngest children.

Cuando naci\u00f3 su primer hijo se dedic\u00f3 al hogar y dej\u00f3 atr\u00e1s la actividad, pues no ten\u00eda quien cuidara de su hijo y a pesar de que las condiciones econ\u00f3micas de su hogar se deterioraban no ten\u00eda otra opci\u00f3n. Hace 1 mes retorn\u00f3 al negocio y decidi\u00f3 hacerlo de manera independiente montando su propio negocio, y aunque comenz\u00f3 con muy poco capital y muy pocas unidades de yogurt a la semana, ahora su negocio ha crecido y tiene buenos pedidos por parte de sus clientes. Yajaiza manifiesta que su mayor ventaja es poder trabajar en su casa y estar al cuidado de sus 2 hijos de 3 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, y al mismo aportar econ\u00f3micamente junto con su esposo al sostenimiento econ\u00f3mico. Ahora que su negocio ha captado muy buenos clientes y tiene la oportunidad de vender grandes cantidades, Yajaiza busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un fog\u00f3n, ollas, canecas lecheras, y materia prima para poder hacer crecer el negocio.\n\nDe esta manera espera superar la dificultad de capital que tiene y sacar adelante su propio negocio, con el que su esposo y sus 2 hijos tengan una mejor calidad de vida gracias a sus ingresos y en un futuro puedan tener mejores condiciones econ\u00f3micas para progresar. \n","en":"Yajaiza took classes nine years ago in dairy processing and then she learned much more about it working in a business over the course of four years. When her first son was born, she devoted herself to home life and left her other activities behind, since she did not have anyone to care for her son and in spite of the fact that the economic conditions in her home deteriorated, she did not have a choice.\r\n\r\nOne month ago she returned to her business and she decided to do it independently by setting up her own business. Even though she started with very little capital and very few units of yogurt per week, now her business has grown and she has good orders from her customers. Yajaiza states that her biggest advantage is to be able to work in her house and be caring for her two children who are 3 and 5 years old at the same time as she is contributing economically, together with her husband, to the support of the household.\r\n\r\nNow that her business has captured very good clients and she has the opportunity to sell large quantities, Yajaiza is seeking a loan to be able to buy a stove, pots, milk cans, and raw materials to be able to grow her business. In this way she hopes to overcome the trouble she has had with capital and propel her business forward. With this loan, her husband and two children will have a better quality of life thanks to their income, and in the future they can be in better economic conditions and they will progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1190666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

To be able to generate the income necessary to provide for her two children and help them to get ahead, Flor purchased a basic sewing machine and began to sew again. Now, thanks to the quality of her work, she has very good customers. The difficulty she has is that since she does not have the right machine, she cannot make whole clothing, and her payment is very low. For this reason, Flor is requesting a loan to purchase an overlock sewing machine which will allow her to take orders for whole clothing and her income will increase considerably.\r\n\r\nFlor hopes that the economic conditions in her home improve considerably, and that her two children will be able to have a better quality of life and access to a better quality education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1190683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

For the past 2 years, Dennis has been working hard to manage his hardware store, which sells cement, iron bars and paint. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Dennis has requested a loan of 2,000,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more paint, iron sheets, varnish and cement, and will help Dennis to generate greater profits and increase his family's prospects. Dennis hopes that in the future he will be able to set up another business.\r\n\r\nDennis is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

At present, she is single and has no children, since she would like to prepare herself for that phase both emotionally and economically. She lives in her parents' house with her parents and her sister, and together they strive every day to improve their quality of life. Carla's work is selling clothing of various brands and different sizes, colors and styles, for men, women and children. She personally takes charge of buying the garments wholesale and selecting them one by one, always thinking about what her customers will like most and the comfort they will feel while wearing the clothing she sells. She has help from her mother with her work. She has already done this work for 3 years, working at her house or visiting some other homes. She has been able to build up a list of steady customers among friends and family members. Sometimes she sells on credit, and other times for cash, and she receives good earnings which help her to stay ahead of her expenses. She really likes what she does, because she has the freedom to manage her time and organize herself according to her customers' availability. At first, like any person who has just started a business, she had some areas of insecurity, but over time she was able to overcome them, and now the business is a great generator of income in her household economy. She hopes to set up a clothing store so that she can keep contributing to her family's progress. This is loan number 3 for her with the MFP institution. She feels happy to know that she has access to a line of credit to move forward with her business. For this reason, she is committed to being responsible with her loan payments, so she can continue in the future. She notes that she likes the work of her communal bank because she considers them a responsible and united group. With the amount she is requesting, 1000 soles, she will buy a great quantity of clothing, including shirts, blouses and pants, which are popular among her customers. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1190742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy shirts, blouses and pants to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-16T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-16T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":171.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":183.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.58,"local_amount":153.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452376,"comment":null},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":151.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":158.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447560,"comment":null},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053458,"comment":null},{"amount":68.6,"local_amount":171.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":179.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188395,"comment":null},{"amount":69.8,"local_amount":174.51,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":182.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572314,"comment":null},{"amount":73.22,"local_amount":183.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":191.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121973,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T18:29:37Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471526,"name":"Adwowa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwowa sells saucepans  at Mpredwow.

de 30 a\u00f1os, es un hombre honesto y muy amable, siempre trabaj\u00f3 mucho para poder brindar una mejor calidad de vida a su familia, convive con Idaura con quien tiene un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os, actualmente vive en el terreno de su suegra en donde le brindaron un espacio en el que pudo construir su casa con mucho esfuerzo y que ahora puede disfrutar habit\u00e1ndola con su familia. La actividad de Emerson, como todos los d\u00edas, es de conducir mototaxi, realiza su trabajo por las principales calles de la ciudad en busca de sus eventuales pasajeros a quienes transporta hasta su destino con bastante serenidad ya que considera que la seguridad de sus clientes es lo m\u00e1s importante, de la misma manera siempre brinda su numero de celular para que pueda ser contactado por alg\u00fan cliente que necesita de su servicio de transporte. Los 5 a\u00f1os de experiencia y la calidad de su trabajo lo coloca como una pieza clave en el oficio que desarrolla. Tiene tambi\u00e9n un puesto de venta de abarrotes en un mercado de la ciudad pero que lamentablemente est\u00e1 decayendo, es por eso que ahora quiere dedicarse a la venta de ropa porque lo considera m\u00e1s rentable y de esta forma complementar su trabajo como mototaxista. Aunque al principio no le fue muy bien, afirma que ahora esa situaci\u00f3n ha cambiado y sus ingresos se han visto multiplicados gracias a las recomendaciones de algunos de sus clientes a quienes prest\u00f3 sus servicios.

He is an honest and very kind man who has always worked hard so that he can offer a better quality of life to his family. He lives with his partner Idaura, and they have a two-year-old son. \r\n\r\nCurrently he lives on a plece of land belonging to his mother-in-law, where they have provided him a space where, with much effort, he was able to build his house. Now he can enjoy living in it with his family. Emerson's day to day work is driving a mototaxi. \r\n\r\nHe carries on his work around the main streets of the city, seeking his casual passengers, whom he transports to their destination quite calmly, as he considers that the safety of his customers is the most important thing. In the same way, he always offers his cell number so that he can be contacted by some client who needs his transportation service. \r\n\r\nHis five years of experience and the quality of his work make him a key figure in his trade. \r\n\r\nHe also has a stand selling groceries in a market in the city, but business is unfortunately declining. That is why he now wants to sell clothing, because he considers it more profitable and wants to complement his work as a mototaxi operator in this way. \r\n\r\nAlthough at the beginning things were not going very well, he says that that situation has changed and his income has multiplied, thanks to the recommendations of some of his customers to whom he provided his services. \r\n\r\nNow he hopes to continue working as a mototaxi operator, and within a relatively short time, wishes to build up his clothes-selling stand.  \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with the MFP institution. That is why he is grateful to those who make possible this loan that will help him fulfill his objectives. Moreover, he says that he feels at ease with his communal bank, as he knows the members and considers them responsible and supportive people. \r\n\r\nHe will use the amount of 2,000 soles to repair his mototaxi so that it functions optimally. He will use the other part of the money to equip his clothes-selling shop. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1190761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for mechanical work on his vehicle, and to equip the place he sells clothing.

Her daily food staple is chicken soup, whereas on weekends the public prefers her delicious ceviche and grilled foods.  She has been in this business for more than 5 years, and carries out this work with the support of her son and daughter-in-law. Since she started this enterprise, her finances have been improving.  She continues with this work because it\u2019s allowed her to use her earnings to carry out other activities such as room and rickshaw rentals.\r\n\r\nShe is currently not in good health, which is why she will dedicate herself only to the rentals business.

Nevertheless, she learned little by little, and now she has become an excellent businesswoman. She likes her work because she can generate her own source of income, in addition because she shares this work with her partner, and because she also has the necessary time to fulfill her responsibilities as a homemaker. She has many plans for the future. Among them, she wants to establish a shop where she can appropriately display everything that she offers for sale and serve her customers in a more comfortable way. This is her 18th loan from MFP, and so she is grateful to all those who make her loan possible so that she can continue with her goals. On her part, she promises to make her loan payments in a punctual manner. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since all its members are very friendly and united.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 PEN that she has applied for, she will buy articles of clothing, sandals, and women's lingerie of various styles and of good quality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1190876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy articles of clothing, shoes, and women's lingerie to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-17T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-17T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":153.95},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":171.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":183.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.58,"local_amount":153.95,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452381,"comment":null},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":151.65,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":158.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447567,"comment":null},{"amount":66.14,"local_amount":165.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":172.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053465,"comment":null},{"amount":68.6,"local_amount":171.51,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":179.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188403,"comment":null},{"amount":69.8,"local_amount":174.51,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":182.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572322,"comment":null},{"amount":73.22,"local_amount":183.04,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":191.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T14:57:36Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471680,"name":"Alejandra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alejandra is 50 years old and married with ten children.\r\n\r\nAlejandra works hard to provide for her family.

To complement this work, she owns 2 mototaxis that she rents out, and she also sells clothing semimonthly in far-away parts of the city. What she likes most about her work is that it's very relaxed since she doesn't have to do anything particularly difficult - in the case of selling clothing, the only difficulty is the long hours of travel that she needs to get to her destination. In spite of everything she is very calm because all of her work gives her the money she needs to cover her personal and familial expenses. \r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she thanks all the people that continue trusting in her so that she can get this new loan that will help her to increase her wok capital.

As the main source of income for her family, for 16 years Zulaika has been growing crops and raising livestock. She started her business with 5,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS). Thanks to her hard work, today Zulaika has two milk cows with calves, 17 head of sheep and goats, and a monthly profit of around 6,000 KGS. She also works 7 hectares of land, where she grows alfalfa and esparcet to feed the animals. WIth the goal of further developing her business, Zulaika applied to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy cattle for fattening and resale.

kids. In order to secure her family\u2019s finances, she has been growing rice as a primary source of income while her husband catches fish to sell. Savoeurt has been in the business for 30 years, earning approximately KHR 37,000 per day and leaving around KHR 13,000 for her savings, after deducting daily expenses. Savoeurt now needs money to buy fertilizers and rice seeds to use in her farmland. Thus, she is leading a group of three to request a loan with VisionFund. Savoeurt is a fourth-cycle client with VisionFund while her two fellow group members are the first-time clients.
