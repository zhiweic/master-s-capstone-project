After leaving the military, this veteran waited for the right opportunity to launch out and start his own business. When the housing market crashed in 2007, the number of bank-owned properties sky-rocketed, creating a large need for property preservation and maintenance. Seeing the opportunity in the market, Russell started R\/M Asset Maintenance, a company which conducts foreclosure property maintenance, lawn care, clean-up and removal, as well as assisting with evictions and lock changes.  \r\n\r\nWith over a decade of experience in the construction, maintenance and janitorial industries, Russell already has the skills necessary to offer high quality, efficient service to his clients. Furthermore, his military training has instilled in him the discipline and work ethic to do whatever it takes to turn his business into a successful venture. \r\n\r\nRussell will use his $4,000 Kiva loan to purchase a truck, power generator and several power tools.

In the community they are know for their energy and entrepreneurial spirit. One of her members is Silvia who operates a beauty salon.\n\nMrs. Silvia is a 31 years old married woman with two children who has always shown an interest in hair styling; styling her friends' and family member's hair as a teenager. Because of this fascination, when she was 19 years old she decided to attend beauty school and try her hand out in this field. \n\nWhen she finally began to work as a stylist she started in a front room in her house with a chair, a small mirror, and a handful of tools, while advertising her service at a low cost to help her gain clients. As she began building her clientele with the full support of her family, she was able to expand the number of chairs, mirrors, and tools, as well as specializing and perfecting her craft.

These nine women are one of the first groups in this area to obtain a loan for their growing businesses. On top of micro-credit, these women benefit from Podemos Progresar\u2019s unique platform, which includes medical assistance, access to education, business development workshops, and legal advice. To ensure that the group takes advantage of all of the credit-plus services that Podemos Progresar provides, they have been assigned a Personal Wellbeing Mentor.\n\nFor example, people working in the Mexican formal sector have access to a medical service known as IMSS, but many entrepreneurs, people working in the informal sector, or unemployed citizens do not have access to it. Podemos Progresar introduces borrowers to and helps them register for a state-run health program known as \u201cSeguro Popular\u201d and now everyone in the \u201cLas Valentinas\u201d group has access to insurance. \n \nAnother Podemos Progresar feature is their sales catalog, which contains many household appliances, computers, and entertainment systems. The idea of the catalog is to provide essential home products to borrowers at the lowest price on the market. In addition, borrowers can sells these goods to their community and have the product delivered to their home free of charge.  This results in an additional income stream for borrowers and improved prices for the goods in the catalog for the community. \n\nGroup member Cinthia, a 26 year-old mother of one, sells perfumes from her house, and occasionally house-to-house throughout her neighborhood. She began mixing fragrances four years ago and is currently collaborating with her niece to create her own fragrance. By December, Cinthia plans to move her business out of her home and into Cahuacan, where no perfume shops currently exist.\n\nOf the nine women, only three of them have finished middle school - some, like Cinthia\u2019s mother, Silvia, have only completed primary school. Podemos Progresar\u2019s platform works to ensure that the entire group can earn their secondary school diplomas. In addition to this, they have access to discounted English and computer classes.\n\nPodemos Progresar\u2019s combination of micro-credit and aditional platform services is just the multi-dimensional solution that this group of women needs to generate sustainable businesses and wellbeing."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1368305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy ingredients to make perfumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nicolas Romero","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":297,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cinthia Anayanci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2437.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":570617,"name":"Las Renovadas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the neighborhood known as \u201cIndependencia\u201d in Nicolas Romero, Mexico, the group \u201cLas Renovadas\u201d definitely consists of independent women who strive to grow their businesses.

Karina's grandparents and father are from the Mexican state of Michoacan, which is known for its delicious artisanal ice cream and popsicles. Karina\u2019s grandparents began making and selling ice cream when they lived in Michoacan and passed on that tradition to all their children, Karina's father included. Her father then moved closer to Mexico City and happened to land in Nicolas Romero, where he stayed to have a family. Karina grew up with homemade ice cream at home and her family finally decided to open up an ice cream shop called  \u201cPaleteria Michoacan.\u201d  Having grown up surrounded by ice cream, she went into the family business and Karina now runs two ice cream shops and she also sells these scrumptious treats at some of the local schools during their lunch periods.\n\nKarina has been successful with her businesses because she dedicates long hours to making the best products and her husband now helps her with the administrative side of the business. The keys to her success lie in that she is able to provide her products at a more accessible price to her clients than the other ice cream shops in the area and that she only uses high quality prime materials which create a better tasting ice cream that her clients love.

The spotless, colorful, yet in many ways modest salon meets clients' hair, beauty and make up needs with the help of her staff.\n\nShahla understands that building a clientele differs from keeping them and it is her priority to make sure her returning clients receive something new from time to time with constantly improving care. To facilitate her investments she took a loan in the past from Relief International Microfinance Iraq, which she used for purchasing a machine for facial treatments. Shahla successfully repaid the past loan. She decided to take a new loan, this time in the amount of USD 7000 to purchase high quality raw materials for her work. Also Shahala would like to move her salon away from her home to a new location. She has already made plans for the move which is expected to take place around August, and will use part of the loan for the miscellaneous costs of the move and make improvements to the salon.\n\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq provides qualified clients with a loan product specifically tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises (or SMEs). Select SME entrepreneurs, featured on Kiva, are participants of the program \"WLIFT: Leveraging the Internet for Financial Transformation\", developed for women in Iraq in a partnership between Kiva, Relief International, and the Cherie Blair Foundation.

He is separated and the father of three children.  All his life, he was raised in the country, where he spent most of his life farming.  Now, he has chamomile plants and complements this activity with milk production from various cows that he owns.  He sells both the chamomile harvest and the liters of milk that he milks daily in a regional market where he lives.  In this way, he is able to obtain enough resources to take home the daily sustenance.  Miguel is a serious, responsible man, committed to his family and his job.  For this reason, he always wants to continue moving forward and looking for a better future.  He is in his first loan cycle and is requesting a loan to purchase agricultural inputs (manure, fertilizer, pesticides) with the goal of continuing with the care of his crops and being able to obtain a harvest in optimum conditions so that he can sell it at a better price at the market and earn higher profits.  All of this will help him continue moving ahead, gradually improving his standard of living and that of his children.  In addition, he will be able to offer his children a better education so that they will have a prosperous future filled with success.

His spouse is a housewife and helps around the farm. In search of the source of income for his family, Ulukman started farming and raising livestock in 2007. Starting from 50,000 somons (KGS), today his farm brings a monthly profit of 5,000 somons (KGS). On his farm, he keeps one dairy cow and 20 sheep.

After the death of her husband, she had to find a source of income for her family and got involved in crop farming and animal husbandry, thus becoming her family's only breadwinner.  She started in this business in 1981 with an initial capital of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her back-breaking work, constant labor and even personality, Darikha has achieved some success in her business and began earning 7,000 som (KGS) per month.  She currently has 10 hectares of farmland on which she grows wheat on five hectares, barley on four hectares and sainfoin on the remaining one hectare.  She gets a good harvest every year.\r\n\r\nDarikha's sons work in public institutions and help her both financially and on the farm.  In order to further develop her business, she has turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS), which will be used to buy mineral fertilizers, fuel, and two young bulls.\r\n\r\nDarikha plans to invest the earnings from her loan into further developing her small business.

At the start of her life she was brought up in a home known as a garden where her mother worked for a flower company. Her hours of work were very long so she did not have time to spend with her children, Diana and her 2 older brothers. One day Diana met a man who she thought would be the man in her life and she had a little boy with him. It was a big disappointment for the family because she was the only girl and she still had not finished her high school education. Her mother decided to help her finish her certificate of secondary education and she was very proud to finish her studies, since the father of her child never accepted him. \r\n\r\nDiana decided to work in a flower company where she would get a bit more work experience and was taken on there as a temporary worker. After a year and a half she took exams to join the company. A month after this she met another boy who she liked very much and she became pregnant again. She had another little boy and this time the father accepted him and helps her to buy food for the children. He does not live with them, however, since he is a man with a lot of girlfriends. \r\n\r\nFeeling very disappointed by this situation, Diana decided to pick herself up and improve her situation in life by studying for a technical degree. What attracted her was Health Administration since every time she went for her check-ups she admired the administrative staff who dealt with her.

John hopes that in the future he will be able to buy an incubator. \r\n\r\nJohn is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like John who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1423644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase more feed that will increase the quality of the eggs ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Matuga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603147,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1450664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase corn by the hundredweight and lime.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.45},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":603370,"name":"Mizuka Youth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mizuka Youth Group is composed of young people who are passionate about football.

She is saved by Kiva and WSDS this season. \r\n\r\nShe says, \u201cThank you so much, Kiva, and I will always remain grateful, and am looking forward to more help from Kiva.\u201d The rest of the group members are also engaged in the charcoal business.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1430640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to rent more land for firewood to use in making charcoal, and sell the charcoal to make more money.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veichinkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemjahoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608072,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is 53 years old, married and has 5 children.  He works as a solar lamp distributor in Mali.\n\nPrior to becoming a distributor for NOTS, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company.   Upon learning about the work of NOTS Mali, he was very motivated to become a distributor because he knew solar lamps would be a great benefit to people living in the rural areas where he lived and worked.  \n\nDaniel sells solar lamps directly to farmers and through small retailers and individual entrepreneurs in Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali.   Most people living in this area work in agriculture and about 80% of the population does not have access to electricity.  They rely, instead, on kerosene, flashlights and candles for light and they must walk long distances and pay to charge their mobile phones.  On top of being harmful to the environment, time-consuming, and damaging to users health (inhaling kerosene fumes is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day), these energy sources are expensive, costing a family about $110 per year - $80 for kerosene and $30 to charge a mobile phone.   \n\nA solar lamp that provides up to 16 hours of light, can charge a mobile phone and has a lifetime of about 5 years costs just $35.  Purchasing a solar lamp is a win-win - families benefit because they save time, money and they are safer and healthier and the environment benefits from less toxic waste and reduced CO2 emissions caused by kerosene use.  \n\nThe funds from Kiva investors will allow Daniel to purchase 570 solar lamps and sell them to cotton and sesame farmers on credit.  These lamps will impact almost 4,000 lives.  Harvest season starts in September, so it is a good time for Daniel to sell lamps as the farmers will have some money to pay for the lamps.  It is difficult, however, for them to pay in one lump-sum payment, so Daniel will collect payments in installments.  This way farmers can access solar light without so much financial strain on their household.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1432179,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2881,"youtubeId":"YpzycAZDKJ4","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1432179},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To buy solar lamps that he will sell to cotton and sesame farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":20050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":9828160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":20050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9828160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609296,"name":"Keletie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 51-year-old Keletie.

She's married to Carlos and the mother of four children who attend school.  She and her family live in a very peaceful community.  It's a Mazahua area and the residents are very friendly and try to get ahead somehow.\n\nAbe, as she's known in the community, has a great enterprising spirit.  At the age of 27 she has a school supplies store that she has had for seven years.\n\nAbe says she started her store because she needed to help her husband with the household expenses and the children's education.  At first she thought about setting up a grocery store but there was a lot of competition.  Then she considered making the most of the school that was close to her house to start a school supplies store, which would also be a very good business.  \"I started with only a few notebooks, colored pencils, pencils, pens, pencil sharpeners, the most essential things.  Little by little, though, I saw a lot of profit and the customers were always requesting more supplies.\"\n\nAbelina says that she has been able to establish her business little by little with small loans from the institution.  Currently she's requesting a loan to buy a photocopier.  She couldn't buy one previously because she didn't have the money.\n\nAbe opens her store very early every day to serve her customers.  She likes having a lot of contact with her customers and always tries to give them the best prices.\n\nAbe's goal is to be able to stock her store a little more.  She thinks she needs a few things and would like to continue with her business because it's a very good way to help with the household expenses.  On the other hand, if she has to close her shop she would have to go out to work and would neglect her children.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1441320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a photocopier","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1263.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1295.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1391.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1434.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1508.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1652.28},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1672.13},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1774.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1850.22},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1956.07},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2046.88},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2152.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.42},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.59},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614175,"name":"Edward","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edward is 22 years old and lives in the town of Seeta in the Mukono region of Uganda.

Association members are engaged in a variety of activities, such as selling improved cook stoves, teaching reading and writing to women\u2019s groups, and educating women in their community about family planning.\r\n\r\nKorotoumou is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains. In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light. With a solar lamp, her customers can save money. Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years. These solar lamps can provide up to 16 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nOn top of benefiting consumers, selling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association, AVEC-Mali. The women earn about $2 per lamp that they sell, and the association earns $3, which is then invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince paying for the lamps up front is simply too expensive, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the group to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire and pay for it in installments.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1444900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy solar lamp inventory that they will sell in their communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":29050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":29050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616107,"name":"Mwanarusi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanarusi has operated a fruits and vegetables selling business.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \r\n\r\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit and then extend credit to their customers.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449284,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2890,"youtubeId":"fPWuc5-0E1s","title":"Kiva Borrower AVEC-Mali from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1449284},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy solar lamp inventory that they will sell in their communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":28825,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avec-Mali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":28825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619107,"name":"Baya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Baya is a 26-year-old widow.

16 years experience in the field of sewing and tailoring, Salma understands the sector, her clients and the concept of supply and demand very well. She also knows that sometimes it is best to change a business and its profile to respond to the costumers' needs and run a profitable small enterprise based on the new directions.\n\nSalma started as a woman's dressmaker in 1997, but since 2010 she is a partner and tailor in a men's suits workshop - a much more profitable and demanded service providing business. The small enterprise is a shared family business and fits perfectly with the demand for having quality traditional suits for men. The imported men clothes do not suit the local market needs neither in design nor in functionality and cultural acceptance.\n\nThe demand for Salma's products is high and Salma would like to increase the productivity of the workshop and expand its capacity. An important item for the expansion is a specific equipment, a machine that works well with the thick, quality suit fabrics. \nWith the potential for growing her business, Salma qualifies to participate in the WLIFT program and is taking a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of 14,000 USD for the expansion of the tailoring workshop and the purchase of equipment for the enlarged business.    \n\nSalma is enthusiastic about learning more about how to improve her business managerial skills. With a highly positive attitude she is an ambitious and hard working tailor, at the same time she is also a wife and a mother of 3 children. At the age of 40 she is already a role model to many other Iraqi women in her area, having earned much respect for both the quality of her work and her dedication to the business.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \r\n\r\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit.  When they receive payment from their customers they will re-pay the Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy solar lamps that they will sell in their communities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":29175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avec-Mali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":29175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621978,"name":"Gombre Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr SAYOUBA repr\u00e9sente le groupe  GOMBRE.
