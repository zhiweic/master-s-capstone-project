Today he is requesting a youth loan from Kiva's partner, Ameen s.a.l, to purchase plants and agricultural products to increase his business productivity and therefore his profits. He is very confident that he will be able to achieve substantial growth in the coming season and hopes that the loan will help him increase his income by 15%."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1220619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase plants and agricultural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2012-10-24T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-23T21:50:09Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LBP","disbursal_amount":2250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165855.29},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169508.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173242.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177058.62},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180958.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184944.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189018.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193182.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197437.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201786.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206231.56},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210774.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.01},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.79},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.53},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.48},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110.57,"local_amount":165855.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-05T10:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":166240.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315319999,"comment":null},{"amount":113.01,"local_amount":169508.71,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-20T09:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":169902.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322928651,"comment":null},{"amount":233.53,"local_amount":350301.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":351115.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339643821,"comment":null},{"amount":498.74,"local_amount":748104.66,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":749844.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347200005,"comment":null},{"amount":131.62,"local_amount":197437.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":197896.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840616,"comment":null},{"amount":134.53,"local_amount":201786.71,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":202255.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698860,"comment":null},{"amount":137.48,"local_amount":206231.56,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":206711.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399945095,"comment":null},{"amount":140.52,"local_amount":210774.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":211264.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410228181,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T21:08:23Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T20:32:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":486901,"name":"Haidar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haidar is a Lebanese married man.

She does repairs like zipper replacement and basting and she makes dresses, sweatshirts and whatever else her customers request.  Her work schedule varies according to her availability.  She buys the supplies and merchandise she needs in stores that specialize in low-cost fabrics and sewing accessories which is economically advantageous.  She will use the loan to buy fabric, thread for the embroidery machine and for the overlock machine, buttons, zippers and needles.\r\n\r\nOne of Mercedes\u2019 goals is to be able to buy a special sewing machine (one that can use from one to three needles) and to replace her overlock machine with a newer one to generate more work and meet customer expectations thus generating higher income and providing better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nMercedes lives with her husband and 19-year-old daughter who is studying.

He works in agriculture and works hard to maintain his family.  He plants vegetables like carrots, potatoes, beets, cabbage and beans on a parcel that he rents a few kilometers from his home.  He learned this work from his parents many years ago, and it was his first job in life.  That's why he did not have the opportunity to attend school.  \r\n\r\nHe has now been working independently in this field for 15 years, but with his own capital.  This has not given him the opportunity to expand his crops, and thus he sees the need and decided for the first time to ask for a loan of 4,000 Quetzales (Guatemalan currency) in order to purchase potato seeds and organic fertilizers.  During this season the harvest is better.  With these funds he can cultivate more in other parcels and expand his crop.  His greatest dream is to cultivate a variety of vegetables since others exist that offer better prices in comparison to what he currently produces.  He also wants to be able to provide his children with better academic studies in the future.

In addition, he owns a vineyard and a plot of land where maize is grown.\r\n\r\nGeorge also has two trucks. He takes wood from the forest and sells it in his village and nearby villages. George requested a loan to purchase tires for his truck, because it is damaged and is already risky to drive in the forest. For this reason, George has stopped operations and takes wood only with one car. After changing the tires, George will be able to continue transportation by both of his trucks and sell more wood. The other part of this loan will be used to purchase agricultural land. George plans to lay out a vineyard and expand his agricultural business. This will increase the family income. Increased income will enable them to improve the family\u2019s living conditions. \r\n\r\n

The profit she makes will enable her to contribute to her children's schooling costs and to help her husband finish building their house. Alexandrine Bernadette is on the left of the photo.

His wife has been working as a distributor in a merchandising company since 2011. Batzaya works as a driver for a local taxi service company which transports people from Darkhan to Ulaanbaatar, the capital. He has been leasing the car from his company. Every day, he has to pay $20 and drives 600 km. The car he is using has too big an engine so it uses 14 liters of gasoline\/petrol per 100 kilometers. The study showed that an average car running on gasoline emits 155g of carbon dioxide per km to the atmosphere. The gasoline contains ingredients like zinc and lead that are harmful to people\u2019s health and the environment. Economically, riding a car with a big engine in Mongolia is not rational, because Mongolia imports fuel products from its neighbors and its price always rises. So, Batzaya is asking 5,000,000 MNT to buy a car that runs on natural gas, which emits fewer harmful chemicals into the atmosphere than gasoline. On one hand, he will contribute his effort to save the environment, and on the other hand he will earn money for his

seemed only fitting to name the group Las Marias de San Jose Chirijuyu (The Marias of San Jose).  \r\n\r\nRecently, we spoke to one of the Marias to gain insight into their Trust Bank. Maria, 48 years old, is married to a farmer and has nine children. She has farmed for many years along with her husband, Bernardo. Years ago, she was also a weaver, like many other women in her community. However, with her loans through Friendship Bridge, she has branched out and started a business selling vegetables and livestock in Guatemala City.\r\n\r\nMaria and her husband are skilled entrepreneurs. They keep money flowing in their local economy by buying crops from farmers in their village and then transporting the crops, along with their own strawberry harvest, to the wholesale market in Guatemala City. To begin this business they used a loan to build a storage facility to safely keep the products until they were transported.  \r\n\r\nRecently they have also started selling livestock.  A new loan would give Maria the opportunity to plant more strawberries and to buy chickens.\r\n\r\nMaria has many goals for her business, but most of all she wants to earn income to enhance her children\u2019s education. Her hard work is paying off as her oldest child is about to graduate from high school. Maria explains, \u201cI completed a few years of primary school, but my parents could no longer support my education so I started working. Now, with microloans that I invest in my business, I can earn enough to keep my children in school. I am so excited that one of my children will graduate this year!\u201d \r\n\r\nMaria and all of the Trust Bank members thank each individual through Kiva, for the effort made to invest in them, even without knowing them personally. Las Marias de San Jose Chiriju Trust Bank recognizes the responsibility that comes with great confidence like this.  \r\n\r\nAll eight women have created a circle of friendship and support. They are determined to stay together to enhance the lives of their families through Friendship Bridge\u2019s microloans and education.

She is married, and has 3 children, aged 3, 7 and 12. She has 1 additional dependent who lives with her, a younger sister, to help with her schooling. In 1998, Christiana established her plastic slippers business. She started the business after dropping out of school, to help the husband with running the home. She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000. Christiana requires a loan in order to buy additional plastic slippers.

They run businesses that revolve around agriculture and textiles in the lush village of San Jose Chirijuyu, Chimaltenango. This is a rural area in Guatemala full of agriculture fields, including the sweet crop of strawberries.\r\n\r\nWithin the group we find Rosa, who is 54 years old and married to a farmer. Rosa did not have the opportunity to attend school, but she and her husband make every effort to keep their four children in school so they can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s dream is that her children will go to college. Thanks to her hard work, they are well on their way as they have already graduated from high school! Like Rosa, the other members of the Trust Bank also are working hard for their children\u00b4s benefit. If they earn an income, their children can remain in school. The women who make up the Mujeres Las Estrellas Trust Bank have 28 children combined. They are excited about the positive impact on the community that their children will have if they all complete school!\r\n \r\nRosa is a determined businesswomen and, through the years, with loans and education from Friendship Bridge, she has grown her company to employ more than twenty artisans during the high season. Rosa is a weaver, like many women in Guatemala.  She needed a unique offering to bring to the market so she started designing and developing a different kind of weaving. The design has become very popular.  With the holiday season approaching, Rosa is proactively planning to ensure that she has enough products to meet the demands of this busy season. Rosa will invest this loan in purchasing the highest quality of yarn, allowing her to produce the fashion and color that her customers demand. \r\n\r\nTo sell the products, Rosa travels to four different cities that are located three to four hours away from her town. She has diversified her markets and now has exclusive clients to whom she sells her product on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nWhile Rosa is just one of the eight women who make up this Trust Bank, they are all just as determined. The women enjoy the monthly meetings in which a loan officer from Friendship Bridge delivers trainings and discussions about topics of interest, such as women's health, children\u2019s rights, business administration, budgeting, and much more.  It is a time for them to learn, laugh, and get support from the loan officer and their colleagues.  \r\n\r\nRosa, on behalf of the Trust Bank, thanks Friendship Bridge and Kiva for the opportunity to have access to microcredit and education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":1218048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to

Maria Zenaida, 24 years old, has outlined a plan to enhance the products she sells in her community.\r\n\r\nLike many Guatemalan women, Maria only has a few years of formal education. She completed the third grade before her mother abandoned the family and her father needed her help on the farm and to take care of her younger siblings. While growing up, Maria\u2019s father taught her many lessons about agriculture. Today, Maria and her husband continue the family tradition of growing a variety of vegetables including cauliflower and broccoli.  They have four young children at home; the eldest has just completed the first grade.\r\n\r\nMaria married her husband at the age of 18. They were both working in agriculture so, together, they continued this practice. Years later, Maria, an enterprising woman, decided to expand their business into animal husbandry. Today, they own 25 chickens and two pigs. Through buying, raising and selling animals, Maria earns extra income for the family.  With a new loan she will invest in feed for her chickens, seeds for their farm, and laying hens so she can begin selling eggs.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s dream is to continue to grow her businesses so she can support her expanding family. She is starting to plan for the future \u2013 she wants to transition the farm to her husband so she can open a clothing store and continue raising livestock. \r\n\r\nMaria and the entire Orquideas de Patzun Trust Bank appreciates the support of Kiva investors.

The Trust Bank is comprised of 11 amazing women who have been part of Friendship Bridge\u2019s Microcredit Plus program for five loan cycles. The Ukux Kem Trust Bank is aptly named as the women weave several products to sell including tablecloths, napkins, and traditional shirts.  \r\n\r\nHermelinda Josefina is a 23-year old woman and a member the Ukux Kem Trust Bank. Despite coming from a large family of ten siblings, she was able to attend high school, study secretarial skills and receive a diploma. Upon graduating, she searched tirelessly for a secretary position but with the economic crisis, she could not find one. Being single at the age of 23, she still needed an income to survive and help her parents care for the younger siblings. \r\n\r\nShe and her two brothers started a textile business, making cortes (traditional skirts) for several different cultures. Their products are so beautiful that they soon found a customer who consistently orders from them. It was clear their business was growing and they needed capital to keep up with supply.  Hermelinda found Friendship Bridge and the Ukux Kem Trust Bank.  \r\n\r\nWith her loan, Hermelinda will buy yarn in bulk and start working in orders for Christmas products. \u201cI am so grateful for this loan. My brothers and I have the desire to make our business bigger but it is not possible without money,\u201d explains Hermelinda.  \u201cOnce we earn extra profit, we will start to save to open a family bakery.\u201d\r\n \r\nHermelinda enjoys the monthly meetings with the Ukux Kem Trust Bank. The Trust Bank receives educational lessons from the loan officers on topics including women's health, self esteem, children's rights, business administration, customer service, and budgeting. This helps all the women manage their businesses and remain competitive in the market. The women would like to thank each and every one of the people who invest in them through KIVA.  \u201cWithout them,\u201d explains Hermelinda, \u201cthere would be no micro-credit opportunity for us,

Since 2001, she has been renting a meat counter in a bazaar located not far from her home. \r\n\r\nDemberel usually sells meat retail and if the day is her lucky day, she sells wholesale to restaurants or pubs. Demberel\u2019s daughter studies at a lyceum. Her husband has been working as a contract worker in Korea for the last 6 years and every month he sends some money for his family. Demberel told us that she saves the money sent by her husband, to spend it for her daughter\u2019s education. And she always requires from her girl \u201cpaying attention only to studies and become educated person\u201d. \r\n\r\nIn Mongolia, the academic year begins in September and parents have to pay tuition fees for their children. To solve this problem, many herders sell their livestock wholesale, so the price of the meat decreases to its lowest point. Now each day in Mongolia is getting colder and colder, so the preservation of meat is not a problem. If Demberel buys meat in large quantity, she can sell it till March. The loan, she is taking will be used to raise her current assets and buy more meat. By doing this, she can earn more income for her family and for her daughter\u2019s education.

She lives with her husband in the Pelengana  neighbourhood of the town of S\u00e9gou.Having left school after the second cycle (in the Mali education system), she became interested at a young age in business, in particular in the buying and selling of charcoal and of firewood. She has been in this business for over 20 years. Her business is very popular and valued in the neighbourhood.\r\nBecause she needs to satisfy her increasing customer demand, she has turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institute. She has had a relationship with this institute for four years now. After properly repaying her four previous loans, she is now in her fifth individual loan cycle. She will use this loan for the purchase of 60 bags of charcoal from markets in the villages around S\u00e9gou.  \r\nFadimata sells for cash and credit to a clientele made up mostly of women. She expects to make an average monthly profit of 36 000 FCFA, which will allow her to help her husband with the family expenses.\r\nHer goal is to buy a residential

She makes a living selling all kinds of products on credit, from meat and ground garlic to televisions, blenders, mixers, etc..  This is due to the fact that people can't buy their products in cash and find it easier to pay in installments.  Her residence is in the Merced zone, and this is where she has the merchandise that she sells.  This is her second loan with this organization.  Mrs. Lucia will use this loan to purchase a variety of merchandise and will also open a store where she can display her products.  Her reason for needing this loan is the lack of cash and needing to fill orders.  Mrs. Lucia faces challenges in her business as in customers that do not pay, which causes her not to be able to get merchandise to other customers that need her products.  She will use the proceeds to buy ground garlic at wholesale and be able to sell it and improve her income.  Her wishes are for her business to grown and be able to give more help to the people that don't have cash available to purchase the products they need this way encouraging them to slowly begin making their own goods.  She gets a lot of satisfaction in seeing her customers happy."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":808.73,"image":{"id":1225712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

to run his community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nEbenezer comes from a humble background and is one of a family of nine. \n\nA true entrepreneur, Ebenezer has the ability to view challenges as opportunities for positive action. When his parents could no longer afford to pay school fees for him and his sister, Ebenezer initiated and ran a cake selling enterprise, and he was able to make enough money to pay for his and his sister\u2019s school fees. He also successfully started his own business, setting up a communications center where he acted as the administrator and oversaw photocopying, processing of photos, and typing. \u201cI believe in putting knowledge into action,\u201d says Ebenezer. \n\nEbenezer is also passionate about uplifting and motivating his community and was very involved in bringing people together for religious and educational programs. He organized many spiritual reunions and tutoring sessions with his peers and was nominated to become the president of a religious group at his school. He was also a leader for an AIDS campaign and the secretary for the student government at his school. He is very proud of African culture and believes that Africa should be modernized and developed but not without an emphasis on values.\n\nAcademically, Ebenezer is a high achiever. He recently came in 12th in his country in a math Olympiad contest.\nEbenezer is passionate about transforming the world by transforming Africa. His goal is to be a strategic adviser to African governments to help create high-growth strategies. He believes that transformative leadership comes from leading by example to inspire and influence others. \u201cLeaders must be self-aware and most importantly cognizant of the fact that they do not always have the answers,\u201d says Ebenezer. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ebenezer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748424,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735307,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T11:16:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489925,"name":"Carlos  Segundo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" CARLOS  SEGUNDO tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad es soltero no tiene hijos, vive con el pap\u00e1 en Ventanas provincia de los R\u00edos.\n\nEs Integrante de la VRC UNIDOS VENCEREMOS, se encuentra ubicada en el recinto la Am\u00e9rica, Perteneciente al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas, esta Ventanilla se dedica a labores Agr\u00edcolas de ciclo corto siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, fr\u00e9jol, gandul.\n\n CARLOS  SEGUNDO  se dedica  a la Agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, Solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar semillas, urea, insecticidas, abonos org\u00e1nicos, l\u00edquido mata maleza. \n\nCon la ayuda del cr\u00e9dito podr\u00e1 comprar los fertilizantes para la agricultura.

The reading club allowed students to trade books with one another. Over and above the educational value of being a part of the reading club, Ghassane realized that the reading club provided a place of safety for certain students after school. \nGhassane has always been incredibly community oriented and is passionate about making a difference. \n\nIn response to the high rate of road deaths in Morocco, a new road code of conduct was released. Ghassane made it a personal mission to raise awareness about the code. With the help of his father, who is a driving school instructor, Ghassane designed flyers to explain the new laws and convinced his friends to help him distribute them in the city.\n\nGhassane is particularly sensitive towards others and displayed great courage when he decided to interview prostitutes in Morocco for a research assignment to investigate their reasons for being in the profession. Despite the fact that this topic was considered taboo, Ghassane recognised the importance of considering the perspectives of people from different walks of society and trying to understand what circumstances led them to select their profession, in the hope of someday being able to address the root cause of the problem.\nGhassane is also passionate about music which he says \u201cpermits the musician to share what is within them with the audience.\u201d\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ghassane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748426,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735309,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T01:18:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489926,"name":"Zoila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoila tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el municipio de Arizona, Atl\u00e1ntida junto a su conyugue y sus tres hijos.

This was a defining moment for Fatou, as she realized the significance that strong role models have on African youth.\n\nFatou is also very interested in art and organized an evening of dance in her community to bring together the adults and youth. \u201cMan does not live by bread alone but he must also live for art which beautifies his life,\u201d she says."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748430,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735313,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T01:21:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489421,"name":"Fatou Camara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatou is an 18 year old full time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, to identify, develop and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nShe was selected one of 100 ALA students out of a pool of over 3500 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nFatou is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to help her to conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nFatou grew up in Dakar, Senegal as one of a family of 7. \n\nShe is passionate about physics, biology, medical research and medicine. Her passion for medicine arose when her brother was diagnosed with a sickness that was incurable in Senegal, and as such, had to be sent to France to seek treatment. This incident was instrumental in Fatou\u2019s decision to actively contribute to the health care sector of Senegal to ensure that all of its people have adequate access to health care. She is passionate about saving lives and finding medicines that will cure improve the living conditions of the sick. In the next 20 years, Fatou sees herself as one of the leaders that will impact the health care sector of the continent. In collaboration with other doctors and biologists, she hopes to advance the stare of research across the continent, provide access to medical services, find cures for epidemics and revalue traditional medicine using natural resources such as forests.\n\nFatou\u2019s innate leadership abilities were demonstrated consistently throughout her school career. Noticing the dwindling nature of her school\u2019s Arabic club, Fatou decided to revitalize the club by adding a debate as a new club activity. Through this change, Fatou was able to attract more members to the club. Fatou organised numerous school events in the capacity as member of the Arabic club. She was also the Communications Officer for the scientific club at her school.\n\nFatou has a track record of academic excellence and in particular, is a talented writer. As a testament to her excellent academics and writing skills, in Dakar, she was selected to represent her school in a writing competition about museums. \n\nAs a leader, Fatou emphasises the importance of surrounding oneself with competent peoples, and motivating those people towards a goal. On the issue of leadership, she says, \u201cSuccess is often perceived by men as a demonstration of their power, of what they are worth, but leadership qualities are not only demonstrated by success. The values of perseverance, confidence and determination surface mostly from our reactions to failure.\u201d\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou Camara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748431,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735314,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614247,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-25T23:00:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489932,"name":"Gertrudis De La Concepci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Gertrudis de la Concepci\u00f3n trabaja para un centro de salud p\u00fablico en el municipio de la paz centro desde hace 25 a\u00f1os como responsable administrativo con lo que ha sacado adelante su familia quien la conforma ella y dos hijos brind\u00e1ndole estudio, alimentaci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s necesidades b\u00e1sicas de un hogar, es madre soltera.\n\nActualmente es su primer cr\u00e9dito que solicita a ceprodel para poder pagar los gastos de estudios de bachillerato de la hija en una escuela p\u00fablica y pago de pre matricula en la universidad, con lo que est\u00e1 apoyando para que ella sea una profesional y mejorar su estilo de vida.\n","en":"Gertrudis de la Concepci\u00f3n has been in charge of administration for a public health center in the city of La Paz Centro for 25 years.

In Tanzania, Sepiso was concerned about her family\u2019s dire financial situation and decided to do something about it. \n\nSepiso started a vegetable garden on a small piece of land at the back of her family home, despite her very limited knowledge of agriculture and an extremely skeptical reaction by her family.  Determined to create a sustainable vegetable garden that would help her family, Sepiso sought the help of her peers to find out how to go about the small farming project. Against the odds, Sepiso was able to successfully grow a flourishing vegetable garden. Sepiso displays perseverance when it comes to achieving her goals: when heavy rain began to wash away vegetables, Sepiso responded by creating a small drainage system. This vegetable garden now supplies her family all the vegetables it needs and also produces enough vegetables to sell to some of the neighbors in their community, thereby providing Sepiso\u2019s family with additional income. \u201cThis project made me see that even small sacrifices have large beneficial outcomes,\u201d says Sepiso. \n\nSepiso is also incredibly compassionate. After one of her aunts died from AIDS, Sepiso committed to volunteering at a clinic for HIV-positive children. \u201cIt is not enough to imagine the possibility of an HIV- free Africa, but [we need] to make it possible,\u201d she says. Sepiso plans to create an orphanage for children affected by HIV.\n\nPassionate about medicine, Sepisio plans to become a doctor and to ultimately specialize in the treatment of cancer. \u201cIn Tanzania, hundreds of people die every day from cancer, often because they are uneducated about the disease and do not have access to adequate facilities,\u201d says Sepiso. Sepiso plans to impact Africa by educating people on the importance of early treatment and treating patients diagnosed with cancer. \u201cA healthy population can build a healthy nation,\u201d she explains.\n\nSepiso is also a gifted student and was awarded as the best student in Mathematics in a nationwide competition. She also occupied several leadership positions at school including running the Environment Club, which initiated and ran projects to promote environmental cleanliness. \n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for her studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sepiso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748433,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735316,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614249,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T00:48:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489428,"name":"Memory","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Memory is a 19-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nMemory was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for her passion for public service, her commitment to Africa, and her demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nMemory is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable her to purchase a laptop to be help her conduct assignments and research, to run her community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nMemory hails from remote Mpika, Zambia and is the third child in a family of five.

is a 17-year-old full-time student at African Leadership Academy (ALA), a two-year pre-university program in Johannesburg, South Africa, with a mission to identify, develop, and connect Africa\u2019s future leaders. \n\nAdil was selected as one of 95 ALA students out of a pool of over 3,000 applicants from across the continent for his passion for public service, his commitment to Africa, and his demonstrated leadership potential to lead change in Africa and beyond. \n\nAdil is applying for a loan of $500, which will enable him to purchase a laptop to conduct assignments and research, to run his community service project and\/or student-run business which forms part of the ALA curriculum, and to participate fully in the world-class program offered by ALA.\n\nAdil comes from Harare, Zimbabwe and is one of a family of four.\n\nAdil has always felt strongly about the impact that science and technology can have on transforming communities. Noticing the waning attendance and poor results of his school\u2019s science club, Adil decided to re-invent the club when he was appointed the club\u2019s president. Adil mobilized a group of some 18 students to submit entries to be exhibited at an upcoming Inter-District Science Exhibition. With new motivation thanks to the club\u2019s strong leadership, Adil\u2019s group went to win second prize at the exhibition, as a result of which they went on to represent their school on a provincial level. The science club is since highly regarded by students and teachers and has never battled with attendance since then.\n\nAdil was named the best student in geography and computer studies. In recognition of his leadership abilities, Adil occupied several leadership positions at his high school in Zimbabwe. He was junior President for three school clubs: the Quiz Club, Leadership Experience, and the Opportunity Club. He also served as captain of the swimming team. In addition to his leadership roles, Adil also excelled academically. Included in his numerous academic accolades was an award for best Science Club Student and Best Computer Student.\n\nIn 20 years\u2019 time, Adil sees himself as a prominent IT systems developer. He wants to promote and develop computer literacy and IT in his home country, Zimbabwe.

In the capacity of Peer Educator, Kudzaishe showed great ability in advising and counselling the younger high school students.  Noticing that some of his schoolmates were struggling with particular subjects, Kudzaishe took it upon himself to arrange remedial lessons for these students through the school. Kudzaishe\u2019s initiative proved to be successful, as all of the students who attended the lessons showed an improvement in academic performance in their ensuing exams. A strong performer academically, Kudzaishe was ranked in the top 5% of students at his school. Kudzaishe was a strong member of his school\u2019s quiz club and has even represented his school in a national quiz competition. \n\nHe was also a part of \u201cYouth Against AIDS,\u201d an organization advocating better awareness of HIV\/AIDS in Zimbabwean high schools. In order to create awareness, the organisation hosts events, runs campaigns on several social media platforms, screens movies, and holds forums during a week that culminates in a music festival.  Kudzaishe was involved in creating this year\u2019s theme: \u201cThe AIDS Free anthem\u201d. Passionate about music and its ability to bring people together, Kudzaishe lives this passion through his participation in an acapella group and by actively using music to push messages surrounding AIDS prevention as part of the Youth Against Aids organisation. \n\nKudzaishe says that he has an \u201cI can do\u201d attitude, which has helped him to achieve all that he has achieved to date. In the future, he sees himself studying software engineering and biochemistry. He would like to harness Africa\u2019s potential in solar energy and offer solutions in improving agricultural yields. Kudzaishe says that he wants to be part of Africa\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap forward\u201d in technology. He is concerned about brain drain and hopes to be one of the Africans fighting for the betterment of Africa in the coming decades.\nOn the question of leadership, Kudzaishe says that leadership is beyond giving opinions, but is also about being tolerant and patient because, \u201cpositive change is only brought about if everyone\u2019s views are represented and considered,\u201d he says.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":249,"image":{"id":1224858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"to purchase a laptop for his studies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZA","country":"South Africa","town":"Johannesburg","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 26","type":"point"}},"partner_id":254,"posted_date":"2012-10-25T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-24T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kudzaishe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-05T11:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331748437,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-26T08:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355735320,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381614253,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-26T08:35:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":487551,"name":"Amany","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amany, who appears in the picture, is a 19 year-old single young woman.

Machoucoura and her husband live together with their children and jointly provide for various household needs. Machoucoura never attended school. For about 20 years, Machoucoura has been selling various products (coolers, dishes and plastic items) as a street vendor. She is dedicated to this work, which allows her to provide for herself and her children. Machoucoura stocks up in a town of Benin.

son in a very welcoming home.  Osiris, who was well referenced, is a very responsible person and a very enterprising young man who likes to work very vivaciously.  He is well respected by his acquaintances from whom he got very good references.  He works with basic grains, as a day laborer, and in coffee harvesting; farming in one of the major production zones for beans.  Everything he produces he sells in different areas of his community.  The demand increased which is why he asks INTEGRAL for a loan that will allow him to buy the supplies to well fertilize the beans because this way they will be in good condition and yield good foliage, which would allow him to get the best out of this harvest and increase his profits from what he believes has been a very good crop.

She is married to Marlito and a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nDanita maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nDanita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She has been running this business for ten years. She also sells fish and keeps goats.\nDama was introduced to Milango by her friends and is applying for a loan of 41,900 Kenya shillings to purchase more coconut leaves, fish and goats. Her main challenges are high inflation, which has reduced the purchasing power of most of her customers, and a shortage of reliable customers.\nDama will save the additional income generated with this loan and use it to provide for her family.
