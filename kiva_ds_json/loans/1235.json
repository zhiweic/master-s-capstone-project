year old widow.  Since her husband's death, she alone has been raising their four children as well as running her own business.  Anarbubu has a secondary level education and her family's main source of income is the animal husbandry business she started four years ago with a purchase of 8,000 somi (KGS) worth of cattle.  As a result of her hard work, today she has two milking cows and 20 sheep.  Her monthly income comes to 3,500 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Anarbubu applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 65,000 somi (KGS) to expand her herd by buying sheep.  Anarbubu plans to invest the profits from her loan in further expanding the size of her herd.  She also plans to save up money for making repairs to her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1449731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T03:18:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616529,"name":"Entisar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Entisar was born in 1972.

Drupadi is one of them. The young lady of 29 years standing second from left in the photo, raising her hand, is Drupadi. She   lives with her husband; one daughter aged 8 and one son of 4 years old.\r\n \r\n Drupadi has been running a general grocery shop in her village for last six years with the help of her husband. She started the business in a very low profile manner with a small investment of her own. At that time her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult on the part of Drupadi to maintain her family. After formation of the group to date Drupadi has already accessed four loans amounting 10,000, 14,000, 18,000 & 20,000 and gradually developed her grocery shop by adding new items like a freezer for selling cold drinks, etc. \r\n\r\nPresently she is earning a monthly income of 10,000 INR, but according to her this is not sufficient to materialize her dream. As per her statement, she was able to increase the variety of items in her shop but not the amount of inventory. She wants to increase her stock of raw materials. So according to Drupadi, the present loan of 40,000 INR will be utilized to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she will replenish her stock less frequently. \r\n\r\nDrupadi hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family as the present house is very small. She has also a dream to give better education to both of her children. Drupadi, with a sentimental mood, expressed her satisfaction that she has got total success due to the timely support of Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\n The other three members of the group are Nandini, Binati and Tapaswini who are running a general grocery shop with dry food making, general store with fertilizer & pesticide, and a dry food supply business respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1446031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for purchasing rice, wheat, oil, biscuits, potatoes, lentils, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"JUNANI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Binati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Drupadi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tapaswini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":148000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":148000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616542,"name":"Marylen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For 10 years now, Marylen has relied on seaweed farming to support her family.

Due to this situation she has not been able to fulfill her dreams like construction of a good house. So these poor situations compel Gouri to search for a credit source for the expansion of her business. So in the year 2013, Gouri, along with three other poor women from her village, formed a Joint Liability Group named Laxmi Narayan and applied for a loan from KIVA partner Mahashakti Foundation for further expansion of her husband\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy bicycle repair tools and spare parts in larger quantities, which will help her to provide better service to her clients and increase her profits.

She has been running a cloth-weaving business with her husband. Presently she has three hand looms for weaving saris. Her husband purchases the yarn\/thread from a trader 20 km away from her village. They knit 80 to 100 pieces from a bundle of yarn, which costs around 10,000-15,000 rupees. Sabitri has engaged two workers for the initial processing and weaving of saris. She only produces saris because of the demand in the market. Sabitri gets five pieces of sari per day. \r\n\r\nShe sells her products to the local traders, who come to take the products from her home on a weekly basis. From this business, she earns a monthly income of 10,000 rupees, which is not sufficient to materialize her future dream.

He is married and has two children.  For now, he and his family live in his parents' house, but Tolibjon is the tenth child in the family and has many brothers and sisters.  All of them live live in their parents' house, which really isn't all that big.  Because of this, Tolibjon started building his family a house of its own.

Her husband moves to different villages and weekly markets on a bike to sell saris and garments. She earns a monthly income of 8,000 INR from her existing business. But the present income is not sufficient to manage the business expenses as well as the household expenses of her family. So Dulabhi wants to raise her income by increasing the volume of her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan from Mahashakti Foundation and looking ahead to the coming festive season, from the present loan of 40,000 INR she is planning to purchase some quality saris and fancy garments to sell.

Khujand.  This city means a lot to him.  It's where he was born, grew up, studied and married.  He also works here.  Abdugani is an expert in repairing and remodeling apartments.  He plasters walls, and installs stoves, tile, plasterboard, floors and paneling.  Unfortunately, his work is seasonal in nature and now with the coming of winter's cold, he doesn't have any work at all.  Abdugani decided to start a new, supplemental business so that his family won't be left without any support. \r\n\r\nHis friend made Abdugani a offer to go into a profitable business together selling electronics since his friend has sales experience.  Abdugani decided to start the business using only a small amount of money.  He plans to buy only two computers and their accessories, so it's not a large amount of money.  He is requesting a loan for this purchase since his own startup capital is only $300 (USD).  Abdugani is hoping the business will be a success."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175.14,"image":{"id":1448886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy two computers for starting a business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdugani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":418.32,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":418.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429561555,"comment":null},{"amount":87.29,"local_amount":415.68,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":416.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440030457,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-11T14:52:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616563,"name":"Emelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelita works hard to support her family.

Tikrapada is a remotely located rural village ten kilometres away from the township. \r\n\r\nThe lady standing second from the left with a raised hand in the photograph is Laxmi. She is a very active and energetic lady. She lives with her husband and one son of four years in a small hut. She belongs to a Below Poverty Line category family. The main source of income for Laxmi is preparing puffed rice and selling it. Laxmi processes the rice and makes puffed rice, and her husband sells it by moving from village to village by bicycle. For the last ten years, Laxmi and her husband have been involved in this business. \r\n\r\nDue to the lack of finances, Laxmi is running this business in a very low-profile manner.  Presently she is earning around 2,000 INR (Indian rupees) per month from this business, so it is very hard for her to manage her family and think of the future. So, to increase her business this year, she, along with five other members of her village, formed a group named \u201cHara Gouri-1\u201d to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nLaxmi has decided to take a loan of 10,000 INR to purchase stock rice and paddy for preparation of puffed rice for a longer period. She hopes this will help her to increase her income and help her to manage her family better than the present status. Laxmi hopes to repair her house and give a better education to her only son. \r\n\r\nThe other five borrowers of the group are Guadei with a goatery business, Maharani with a vegetable cultivation and vending business, Suru with a milk and vegetable business, Kumari with a goatery and vegetable vending business, and Purnnami with a milk business.

Subidha, a lady of 41 years, lives here with her husband and three sons of 26, 23 and 20 years, in a small mud house. The lady standing second from left with a raised hand in the photograph is Subidha. Her family belongs in the below-poverty-line category. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for Subhida\u2019s family is cultivation, which is seasonal only. Due to this situation, it was very difficult on her part to maintain her family. So, to add some extra income to her family, Subidha herself started a general store in her house twelve years ago. She started this business in a low profile with a small investment of her own. She sells general grocery items like oil, sugar, tea, soap, washing powder, lentils, biscuits, toffees, eggs, etc. She purchases stock for her business on a weekly basis from the wholesalers of the nearest town, ten kilometers away. After five years, she purchased a sewing machine, and her husband started a tailoring center. \r\n\r\nFrom the above two sources, she earns a monthly income of 5,000 INR (Indian rupees), which is not at all sufficient to manage her five-member family. To expand her business for more income, in the year 2013 she, along with three other members of her village, formed a group named \u201cHara Gouri-2\u201d to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation. \r\n\r\nSubhida wants to increase the stock of her business with this loan amount of 10,000 INR by purchasing items like lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc. Subidha hopes this will help her to increase her income for materializing her dreams of construction of a house and the marriage of her sons.\r\n\r\nThe other three borrowers of the group are Lalita, Dharatri and Indra, doing milk and vegetable vending, bedsheet stitching, and milk selling businesses respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase lentils, soap, biscuits, spice items, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TIKRAPADA, BALANGIR,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dharatri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subidha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T20:14:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616465,"name":"Clyde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clyde is a natural businessperson. Prior to opening the 5050 Smoke Shop in Newark, he owned a variety store for a year and a half, selling a small collection of t-shirts and water pipes. He found that the younger crowd in this particular neighborhood demanded these products; he wanted to offer these items exclusively to cater to this customer base. \r\n\r\nThe idea to open 5050 began about a year ago, and was developed along with Clyde\u2019s business partner, Ryan, who is also an accountant. Clyde believes the venture perfectly combines their passions for sales\/retail and entrepreneurship with event promotion and community relationship building. \r\n\r\nClyde is always thinking about his target consumer and how to best meet their needs. In the future, he hopes to expand into other areas, such as 24-hour convenience stores, in the same neighborhood. \r\n\r\nThe funds from this loan will go toward creating an in-house screen-printing system, which will allow Clyde and Ryan to create their own t-shirt designs. They will also allocate money for shelving in the new store, as well as marketing and promoting an opening event.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1446101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to fund an in-house screen-printing system and an opening event promotion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Newark","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2013-10-12T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-11T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":5250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clyde","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":5250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.3},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.82},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":227.63},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.47},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.35},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.27},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.22},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.24},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.68},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.55},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.55},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.92},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.59},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":222.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.82},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.63},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.47},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.35},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.27},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.22},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.22},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.24},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616574,"name":"Floreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Floreta is 66 years old and from Getafe, Bohol.

Svetlana raised her children alone, with her own efforts and resources.  She is always working, she never just sits around doing nothing.  Svetlana has her own car, which she sometimes uses to earn a little extra money driving it as a taxi, but her primary business is in repairing and remodeling apartments and houses.  However, Svetlana herself lives in a house that has needed repairs for a long time, but she doesn't have the money to do this.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, Svelana took out a loan from MDO Arvand and started to do the repairs but she didn't finish because she didn't have enough money.  Now, she would like to finish the repairs so she can live in a normal, functional house.  And so, Svetlana has applied to MDO Arvand for another loan for the purchase of building materials for her home.  She is hoping for a favorable decision and would like to thank in advance MDO Arvand for its support.

Now that Shokirdzhon has his own family of five children, he himself is in the business of farming and raising animals, since he has so much experience in this field.  He earns a good income from his business.  \r\n\r\nShokirdzhon started working with MDO Arvand in 2012 when he took out a loan for developing his business and he conscientiously repaid his loan.  Presently, he would like to expand his farming business by buying up a large amount of seed and fertilizers.  For this reason he applied to MDO Arvand wanting a loan to buy the seed and fertilizers.  Shokirdzhon is hoping for a positive decision and would like to thank in advance MDO Arvand for its support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1446902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seed and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shokirdzhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4530.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550198,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-13T03:36:43Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616581,"name":"Munguntsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Munguntsetseg is a bachelor degree student who studies at the public university.

Until recently, he has been working in construction, however, this type of work has become too physically demanding for him.  Abdukakhor decided to start raising cattle in his yard.  He has already prepared the necessary space for this activity.  The only part left, is to buy calves and some feed for them.  His savings of 350 dollars are inadequate to cover the entire purchase.  Abdukakhor is asking for a loan to buy four young calves and feed.

He finished the second grade, and for about five years, he took classes at night. Ismael is married with one son, age 18. His wife is a homemaker, and his son works in agriculture. Ismael says that he has to provide for his wife and son.\r\n\r\nIsmael has worked in agriculture since he was ten years old. He learned to farm from his father, who used to bring him along to help with the oxen, the plough and planting crops, especially corn and beans. Ismael has 7,000 square meters of corn planted and 3,5000 square meters of beans. He also grows yucca on a plot of land by his home. Ismael says that he walks about ten minutes to reach his fields, and that he works from six to ten in the morning, and returns in the afternoon to keep an eye on the crops. \r\nAdditionally, Ismael buys a few baby chicks, which he later sells when they are fully grown to make money. \r\n\r\nIsmael is requesting this loan, which he says he needs urgently, to buy agricultural supplies to control infestations in his crops. He will use it to buy fertilizer and pesticides against maggots and flies, as well as leaf pesticide for his beans, which are infected with a fungus that is burning the leaves.  Ismael says that the loan will help his entire family, because he does not have the money to buy what he needs.\r\n\r\nIsmael hopes to continue working in the fields to provide for his family. He says that the loan will help him to have a larger harvest, which will increase his income so that he can pay for his family\u2019s basic needs.

Her monthly income amounts to 16,000 somi (KGS).\r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Shynarkul applied to microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 60,000 somi (KGS) to buy a horse.  Shynarkul plans to invest the income from the loan in acquiring more cattle and to save money to buy a car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":95.83,"image":{"id":1449957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a horse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jailgan village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T01:30:08Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shynarkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2400},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2700},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2900},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":647.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2339.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427120,"comment":null},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":2300,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2339.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942661,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-01T13:43:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619473,"name":"Pedro Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro, tiene 45 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres en casa propia, debido a la necesidad de mejorar sus ingresos nace la idea de establecer una tienda, es as\u00ed como desde hace un a\u00f1o cuenta con su negocio que atiende de 7:00 a.m. hasta 7:00 p.m., no se le dificulta atender su tienda por que est\u00e1 ubicada en su casa.

She is the mother of four children. Her husband owns a beauty salon, which is the only source of income for the family. His monthly net income is insufficient to pay the children's school fees, pay the electricity and gas bills and to meet the daily food needs and other expenses. He has to support his family as well. Presently, he is planning to grow his business. For that Shazia, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of beautician products like lipstick, hair dryers, facial creams and makeup kits to work more professionally. With the amount of profit, he will put aside some savings amount and pay the electricity and gas bills. Shazia hopes that the loan will be helpful to her husband's business.

Her credit requests were rejected several times, as she was unable to satisfy their requirements. \r\n\r\nShorena received the credit in the framework of joint initiative of Kiva and Credo - Startup Program that gives rural poor people the chance to start or re-start businesses.  With the loan of GEL 500, she will purchase clothing at wholesale prices and sell it in her community door-to-door. \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the job is hard for Shorena, but she is ready to deal with the difficulties and develop her trading business gradually.

Khatuna works as a tailor; she gets orders from home to sew different kinds of clothes. \r\n\r\nKhatuna decided to request a loan for purchasing a cow. The Start Up loan, which is a joint initiative with Kiva and Credo, enables her to get a loan of 1,500 GLL (Georgia lari) for purchasing a cow.

She has been doing this type of business for 19 years together with her husband who is her partner. \r\n\r\nDue to an increase in their orders from customers, Gloria is in need of an additional capital to meet and respond immediately. In this connection, Gloria is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000 to buy materials like bamboo and varnish for the finishing touches to their products. Gloria is always aiming to satisfy her clients, thus she is trying her best to provide better output and service.

Ainura has secondary education. As a source of income for her family, Ainura works with livestock breeding, after having started 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainura's persistent work, her farm has one dairy cow, one calf, two horses and twenty sheep today.

years. She is the mother of three adult children, all married, one of whom lives nearby. Edelmira has only a second-grade education because when she was a child, her parents said that education wasn't important. Edelmira therefore stayed home helping manage the family's home. \r\n\r\nOver 40 years ago, Edelmira started a business selling clothing, wood and aluminum products, and various other goods in order to generate additional income for her family. She sells her goods door to door and goes to an island where some relatives live to sell to people there, staying on the island three days each week because it's so far from her home.      \r\n\r\nEdelmira will use funds from this loan to purchase more merchandise for the business, including cleaning products such as brooms, mops, brushes, and more clothing. The business is generating more customers and demand for products is growing. \r\n\r\nEdelmira hopes to keep the business growing in the future and notes that given her age it won't be possible to keep selling door to door. She therefore plans to set up a shop where she can run the business and maintain a regular income.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":94.62,"image":{"id":1450712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase cleaning items such as brooms, mops, and brushes and more clothing, as her business is gaining more customers and higher demand for products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"La Uni\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edelmira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":52.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2015-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":73.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.19},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":43.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505268,"comment":null},{"amount":50.75,"local_amount":50.75,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716349,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T07:03:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616743,"name":"Rochelle","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Rochelle, 31, resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines.

is an ambitious 34-year-old married man with one child. He is trained in finance and accounts and used to work full-time for a finance institution in Kenya up to the year 2011, when he decided to venture into retail trade since his employment income was not enough take care of his family and his aging mother. \r\n\r\nSimon started a retail shop to sell veterinary products and employed one trained person to work as the shop attendant and offer agriculture extension services to the farmers in the area. This idea was triggered by the absence of veterinary shops and extension services in an area whose major domestic and economic practice is farming. The business has been doing well. He is currently carrying out some research in partnership with a local NGO, on the best farming practices in his region. \r\n\r\nSimon was introduced to the solar lanterns, which provide safe and bright lighting and come with a mobile charging function, by Brazafric green energy marketing team. Due to the recurring high cost and health risks associated with paraffin, which is the commonly used lighting fuel in the area, he saw an opportunity to increase his sales, and raise the living conditions of people in the community. \r\n\r\nSimon appreciates the benefits accruing from the use of solar lanterns, and with the Kiva financing option from Brazafric, he is seeking financing to purchase solar lanterns to stock and sell to the community. He has a good rapport with the farmers around the area and from his assessment, the solar lanterns will sell fast, based on the need for the product and the trust he has gained from the villagers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1446675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy solar lanterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitise-makueni","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":213,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":169668,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28278},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28278},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28278},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28278},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28278},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":28278}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-15T17:11:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616762,"name":"Ma.

","en":"Claudia is 34 years old and a stylist, work she has done throughout her working life in different hairdressing salons.  Claudia started learning this trade when she was very young as her family were having financial difficulties and Claudia had fallen pregnant at 14.  Because of this Claudia needed a job in order to earn an income to pay for the baby and support the family's finances.  After starting beautician classes at a local institute, Claudia found work in a hairdressing salon and, later, did further training and specialisations, increasing her knowledge and opening up the path to more possibilities in the working world.  After working as an employee for a number of years, Claudia decided to go it alone and started to offer her services, going round to her customers' homes.  Her determination and enterprising spirit, and her desire to do better, have led Claudia to look for opportunities to get ahead.  So, she is applying for her fifth loan, which she will use to buy fixed assets (mirrors, display cases), and supplies and merchandise in bulk (dyes, shampoo, hair treatments, hair accessories); she will also make improvements to her premises.  All this will allow Claudia's business to grow as she wants to start her own beauty salon in her home.  There she will provide service to her customers, who will be more comfortable. All of this will result in an increase in sales, which she can use to continue supporting the family finances.

She began this activity empirically, only with the intention of generating an income to support her husband in the economic burden of their home. \r\n\r\nShe is a thriving, dedicated, and tenacious woman.  Day to day, she faces the different risks to which she is exposed on the street with her only goal being to safeguard the wellbeing of her children, who are her main motivation for continuing ahead. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the support of the loan to purchase kitchen utensils (pots, pans, spoons, knives) and to purchase supplies wholesale (vegetables, meat, chicken, flour, salsas). This will allow her to improve her work conditions and to be able to expand her portfolio of products to satisfy the diverse tastes of her diners and to be able to attract new and potential customers from the people who travel through the area. \r\n\r\nAll of this will be seen reflected in the increase of her income, with which she will be able to continue contributing economically to her home.

is a 38-year-old married woman, living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

By this time she has attained a regular list of customers and makes enough to contribute to the family income. Her husband is a driver by profession and drives an auto rickshaw. He also delivers the handmade glove to the market with his rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe is a mother of 5 children and is motivated to provide for her family. To cope with the increasing demand of her customers, she requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase stocks of leather. She hopes to get a boost in her earnings through her large sales. She is in her first loan cycle, and she assures us that she will show an excellent repayment behavior. She wishes to utilize a portion of the revenue to provide a quality education for her children.\r\n\r\nShamshad says thank you to Kiva and to its field partner BRAC Pakistan.

This allowed her to generate enough resources to meet the basic needs of her home.\r\n\r\nHer positive attitude, commitment, and dedication have led her to overcome hardships. However, she struggles every day but is more eager to give the best to her children. \r\n\r\nShe is applying for the loan with the purpose to buy fixed assets (a sewing machine) and supplies at wholesale (wires, springs, and fabric). This way, she will be able to improve her production time and make it easier to make her products. This will positively affect the input of her economic resources, the carrying out of product sales.\r\n\r\nMaria dreams of enhancing and growing her business so that it would be more profitable and allow her to have a favorable economic stability to address basic needs and provide a better education for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":93.6,"image":{"id":1450810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fixed assets (sowing machine) and supplies at wholesale (wires, springs, and fabric).

The income is the result of both jobs and with it she pays the bills and cares for the basic needs of the family. \r\n\r\nHer main customers are coworkers of one of her daughters. Her determination, drive, and dedication have enabled progress toward meeting her set goals. This is why she is encouraged to apply for the loan to invest in buying wholesale merchandise (accessories, cosmetics, perfumes, etc.). In this manner, she will increase her product portfolio and be able to meet the needs and preferences of her customers, resulting in increased revenue she receives for each sale.\r\n\r\nThis allows Norelia to continue working hard to fulfill the dream of saving and putting up a general store where she could sell all her products and continue to receive income to give her family a better well-being and quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":96.4,"image":{"id":1450815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase wholesale merchandise (accessories, cosmetics, perfumes, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-10-13T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-12T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":54675},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":56190},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":57747},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":59347},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60992},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62682},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64419},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":66204},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68039},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":69924},{"due_date":"2014-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71862},{"due_date":"2014-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73853},{"due_date":"2014-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":75899},{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":78002},{"due_date":"2014-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.54},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.48},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.12,"local_amount":114768,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":118720.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074719,"comment":null},{"amount":33.28,"local_amount":60501,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":62584.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009916,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-12T15:51:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":616761,"name":"Alfonsus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfonsus is a 47-year-old man, married to Yustina, a 47-year-old woman.

She belongs to a happy family because her son earns sufficient income to meet daily household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer son has been running a generator-repair workshop for many years in a nearby town. He is very professional and experienced in his work. As we know, there are lots of problems due to load shedding of electricity, so most of the people like to use a generator to generate the electricity. Due to heavy usage, most of its parts become out of order. This is the reason her son has so many customers for generator repairing. \r\n\r\nHer son is very hard-working and honest; he asks very low services charges against his services. That is why people like to repair their generators from him. \r\n\r\nHer son wants to buy spare parts for generators and tools for generator repair, but he does not have sufficient savings to spend for purchases because recently he spent his savings for an emergency need.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shehnaz has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her son will be able to buy his desired spare parts and tools for repairing. \r\n\r\nShehnaz hopes that through all this purchasing, customers will be attracted toward his shop, which would led to an increase in income and savings.\r\n\r\nShehnaz has praises for the lenders and is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner, BRAC

She buys inventory herself, and then resells it.  Istat mostly focuses on selling women's shoes and clothing.  In preparation for the upcoming winter, Istat is taking out a loan to buy a collection of fall and winter clothing and shoes for women.  She understands how hard it is for children at this time and she tries to give them everything.  She feels that the welfare of her family depends on her income and therefore she works very hard.

For the improvement of her business, she contacted a Kashf Foundation business development officer for a loan of 20,000 PKR to purchase rubber bladders and leather covers in a large quantity to cater to more customers without delay.

is a 43-year-old married woman and the mother of five. She has been running a business with her husband selling milk for the past 15 years. She has two buffaloes and one cow with milk and she sells their milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter and cheese that she makes from the milk. Suraya looks after the buffaloes and performs the task of collecting milk from them while her husband sells it to different places on a daily basis.

She has been a vendor for many years and intends to work in this field for many years more. She needs to bring warm children clothing\u2019s from the city as soon as possible.

Meerimgul has a high school education.  The main source of income for her family is raising of livestock, which she started 7 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 4,000 KGS.  Thanks to the Meerimgul's persistent work, she now has one milking cow, two horses and six sheep.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Meerimgul applied to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase heifers for breeding.
