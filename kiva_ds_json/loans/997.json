She sells all of these food products in front of her home on a large table.\r\n\r\nShe does a good job, so her business is highly visited. She has been in this spot for six years, and she has been able to make a good income which she has used to build her home.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning it was hard to build up a customer base, but with time people started recommending her business because of her good service and delicious food. She hopes to be able to expand her business since she has a great desire for the future to own a tourist restaurant. This will be her fifteenth loan with MFP. Things are going well for her and she is very happy to be part of such a responsible group. \r\n\r\nWith the requested 3500 soles, she will buy more groceries wholesale. She will buy rice, oil, condiments, bananas, and also some chairs for her customers\u2019 comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1236812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, oil, condiments, and bananas, and to buy some chairs for her customers' comfort.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T14:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T14:50:01Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":540.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":555.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":553.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":597.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":619.49},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":633.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.39},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.58},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":422.84,"local_amount":1096.26,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1101.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188865,"comment":null},{"amount":213.58,"local_amount":553.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":556.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572762,"comment":null},{"amount":230.36,"local_amount":597.22,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":600.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122427,"comment":null},{"amount":238.94,"local_amount":619.49,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":622.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868247,"comment":null},{"amount":244.28,"local_amount":633.31,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":636.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577066,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-06T18:56:03Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":497785,"name":"Ahmad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmad is a 29-year-old single man who has been working in a baking business for 18 years.

Her earnings were a big help in their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a new 15,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of their jeepney unit. Her profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain their daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nBienvenida dreams of having another vehicle in the coming years and hopes that her children will have a good future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*Curiously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese government. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

is 52 years old, married, and has one child. Her husband is a worker who earns a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. Ne'ma is preparing wedding requirements for her son who will marry soon, but the amount of money she has is not enough to cover all the costs. \r\n\r\nNe'ma is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing new bedroom furniture in order to improve living conditions of her son and his bride. Ne'ma is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her son appears in her Kiva profile photo.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

After some time, he decided to open his own underwear store. He began acquiring experience and also started to sell bundles of used clothing, wholesale and retail. He now sells underwear and bundles of clothing. He has had this business for 40 years. He works with his daughter; she runs the business while he goes out to distribute stock to the stores.

cacao, caf\u00e9, palma africana y productos forestales y adem\u00e1s el comercio es el trabajo diario de la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes para poder salir adelante y m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando han incrementado las v\u00edas para llegar a este cant\u00f3n lo que ha permitido un gran movimiento comercial en especial los fines de semana en donde salen comerciantes de todo tipo a ofertar sus productos en la feria a sus potenciales clientes que la mayor\u00eda de veces suelen ser campesinos. El turismo tambi\u00e9n es un aporte muy importante para este cant\u00f3n pues su ecosistema natural tiene mucha variedad de lugares para ser visitados cascadas, r\u00edos de agua dulce,  bosques, que tienen flores y animales que adornan esta ciudad. En varios sectores  de esta provincia, residen familias que se dedican a la agricultura, y muchas veces su esfuerzo no es valorado, pues las empresas pagan costos muy bajos por los frutos que sus tierras producen, sin embargo, el sustento siempre est\u00e1 presente. En esta ciudad reside Mar\u00eda, una mujer de 41 a\u00f1os que tiene 2 hijos que estudian en el colegio. Ella termin\u00f3 la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y el obst\u00e1culo m\u00e1s grande que ella ha atravesado es la migraci\u00f3n de su esposo H\u00e9ctor a Espa\u00f1a. La necesidad de una mejor calidad de vida, separ\u00f3 a esta familia pero el lazo que sembraron desde el principio, los ha mantenido unidos en medio de la distancia. \nMar\u00eda desde muy ni\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 la actividad de la agricultura con varios frutos, hace 10 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 esta actividad con su esposo y actualmente lo desarrolla sola con un poco de ayuda de sus hijos. Su experiencia en el negocio ha dado muy buenos resultados y cada vez ha incrementado el negocio con nuevos productos. Todos los d\u00edas entre 8 y 10 horas alternadas con el cuidado y atenci\u00f3n a sus hijos, Mar\u00eda cuida los cultivos y prepara los que est\u00e1n listos para la venta, adem\u00e1s atiende a sus clientes de la mejor forma posible para as\u00ed entregar un valor agregado a esta actividad. El cacao es muy demandado en el sector por lo que Mar\u00eda solicita un cr\u00e9dito para incrementar sus cultivos de este fruto que es muy apetecido internacionalmente. Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa fue en donde encontr\u00f3 el apoyo y la agilidad que necesitaba, adem\u00e1s que la asesor\u00eda que le brind\u00f3 el ejecutivo que le visit\u00f3 personalmente, sirvi\u00f3 de mucho para que ella realice mejoras en varias \u00e1reas de su negocio. Mar\u00eda espera que este cr\u00e9dito aporte al crecimiento de su negocio y por ende ella pueda obtener mayores utilidades que le permitan dar a sus hijos la educaci\u00f3n profesional que ella no pudo obtener. ","en":"Quinind\u00e9 is a district in the province of Esmeraldas that provides various products to cities in Ecuador like banana, cacao, coffee, African palm and products from the forest and commercial activity is also a daily way for the majority of the inhabitants to get ahead and even more so after the roads to get to town have been expanded which has permitted a lot of commercial traffic, especially on the weekends when all types of businessmen come to offer their products at the market to potential customers who are usually people from the countryside. \r\n\r\nTourism has also been an important activity in this area because the ecosystem has a lot of different places to be visited like waterfalls, fresh water, and woods that have flowers and animals that surround the city. In various sectors of the province, there are families that work in agriculture and a lot of the time their work is not valued demonstrated by the fact that companies pay very low prices for the fruit of their labor, nevertheless, there is always food present. In the city where Mar\u00eda lives, a woman who is 41 years old and has two children who go to high school. She herself finished secondary school and the biggest obstacle that she has faced is the migration of her husband Hector to Spain. The necessity to find a better quality of life separated this family but their bond remains strong, being formed from the beginning, and it is this bond that has kept them together despite being so far apart. \r\n\r\n Mar\u00eda, since she was very little, learned about the agricultural industry with various plants and 10 tears ago she undertook this activity with her husband but currently she has been developing their business on her own, with a little help from her children. Her experience in the business has given her very good results and every time she has expanded with new products. Every day between 8 and 10 hours, with the care and attention of her children, Mar\u00eda,takes care of her fields and prepares those that are ready for market. She also tends to her clients in the best way possible in order to give a certain dignity to her work. \r\n\r\n Cacao is a very demanding sector to work in and this is why Mar\u00eda is applying for a loan to increase her production of this plant, that is desired internationally. It was with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa where she found support that she needed as well as all the consultation she received from the executive that visited her personally and it really helped her to improve in various areas of her business. Mar\u00eda hopes that this loan will support the growth of her business and that she will be able to earn more which will help her give her children the professional education that she was not able to get. \r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1237828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase seeds and increase her cacao production.

She comments that she used to work door to door and in open air markets, but now she has rented a shop that she will open and she will attend to her customers in the way she has always dreamed of, calmly and satisfying the needs of her customers.  \r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise and consumables that she needs in the city of Santiago, where she finds a large variety of articles that she offers in her shop at a low cost.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will buy storybooks, notebooks, colored pencils, various decorations, socks, scarves, calendars, gift bags, and canvas sneakers among other items.  One of Maria\u2019s goals is to open her shop soon in order to receive her customers and offer them all of her merchandise.  What they ask for, she will have.  \r\n\r\nMaria has a partner, but they live in separate houses.  Her dream, on a personal level, is to die peacefully and pain-free, surrounded by her loved ones.  On a work level, her dream is to grow with her shop and to be able to help people that need it.  She comments that with the sales she makes, for the Christmas season, she will prepare 40 gifts that will be delivered to children with scarce resources that live in the surrounding area.  \r\n\r\nShe feels happy, grateful and excited for the support provided by Fondo Esperanza because it opened a door for her and allowed her to invest in her business and also her personal development as she has learned to organize and distribute her income and investments in a better way.  \r\n\r\nValparaiso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital and is the seat of the country\u2019s legislature.  It is the first port of the nation and it offers a great variety of beautiful and picturesque places like the house of the poet Pablo Neruda, winner of the Nobel Prize, for example.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":1237806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy storybooks, notebooks, colored pencils, various decorations, socks, scarves, calendars, gift bags and canvas sneakers, among other items.

Today those customers are customers of her laundromat. Her experience in these fields was a result of managing the market, little by little observing the needs of her neighbors. \r\n\r\nShe started the business with what motivates her to earn more money, sustaining her family and her 1 year-old child. Her work day begins from 6 in the morning until 10 at night or later. If its what the customer need it that way, she will do it to be competitive in the market. \r\n\r\nLately, she needs to increase the number of washing machines because there is a larger demand than usual, and many could become new customers. They are leaving without using the service because they are rented.

Mangala to access loans from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses. Nirasa is one of these women. The lady standing second from left, wearing a red shawl in the photograph, is Nirasa. Nirasa, 32 years old, is a very energetic lady who lives with her husband, one son who is 13 years old and one daughter who is 7 years old. The children are continuing their studies in the local school. \r\n\r\nNirasa has been running a general store in the heart of the town for the last two years with the help of her husband. She sells items like biscuits, dust tea, oil, shampoo, toffee, and grocery items. She has been able to increase the variety of items in her general store by taking her first loan from Mahashakti Foundation. Her daily net income from the existing business is around Rs 400\/-. With this income, her household expenses are in a deplorable state.  Nirasa purchases items from the local wholesaler twice a week. With the present loan, Nirasa wants to increase her stock by purchasing items like lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo etc. for her general store. This will help her to increase her income and  reduce the purchasing costs as she replenishes her stock frequently.  Nirasa hopes to save enough money to provide a better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Nurjahan, Saraswati and Baidehi. They run a water servicing center, sell vegetables at wholesale and run a Tiffin (lunch) pushcart.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1239216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase lentils, oil, soap, washing powder, shampoo, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-19T23:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-19T23:00:41Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurjahan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saraswati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baidehi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nirasha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":108000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":108000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T15:36:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":498011,"name":"Methuselah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Methuselah is 32 years old, married and the father of three children.
