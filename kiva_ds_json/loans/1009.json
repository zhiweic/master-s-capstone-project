She runs her business from her marital home, and she is is high demand due to the quality of her products. Three years ago, she decided to join the micro-finance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to satisfy her growing customer base. She has received five group loans as a member of an association of women from her neighborhood (Association BRILLANT de Sanoubougou I). This is her first individual loan. The loan will allow her to increase her working capital so that she can buy the raw materials that she needs (cottonseed oil, lye, cottonseed oil waste, black soap paste).\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy 10 containers of cottonseed oil, 10 containers of cottonseed oil waste (black soap paste), 3 bags of lye, 4 packets of scents, and 4 cartloads of firewood. She buys the raw materials in her local area and in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). After making the soap, she sells it retail to a clientele made up mainly of women from her town.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 195,000 FCFA, which she will use mainly to grow her business, contribute to family expenses, and pay the interest on her loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1245247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy raw materials for making soap","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T16:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T16:10:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168441,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339625056,"comment":null},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168440.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922751,"comment":null},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168440.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029807,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-01T22:52:08Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":501989,"name":"Remie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remie is 56 years old,  and she resides at Amulung with her husband and children.

She has a son but had to leave the father because of his mistreatment of them both. Now Alicia has the sole responsibility of caring for and feeding her son. \r\n\r\nBecause of the recent drought the potatoes which she grows on her small parcel of land  did not mature properly. This natural disaster resulted in a diminished income, money that she was expecting.\r\n\r\nAlicia is a well-liked and respected person in the community where she lives because of her dedication to her son and to her work. Sometimes she even has to take on day labouring jobs on the land to earn a little money to care for her son. She is seeking a loan to buy peanut and bean seeds and organic fertilizer to improve her crops. In this way she will increase production and earn more money. In turn this will lead to an improved standard of living and her son will be better able to attend school. The loan will help Alicia and her son greatly with their difficult

These tribal women came together to help one another in the form of a group to access a loan. They live in a small village on the outskirts of Churachanpur district of Manipur state in the northeastern part of India. \r\n\r\nHatkhovei is pictured with raised hand. She is 44 years old and is a mother to three daughters and two sons. Her husband is a farmer by profession and owns a large paddy field where he grows rice. He rears 10 cows which help him in ploughing his field, and he sells milk for money. This is how Hatkhovei assisted her husband before she ventured out to do something of her own. Since her children are coming of age and needed more money for their education, clothes and maintenance she wished to take up some income-generating activities in order to supplement the family income.\r\n\r\nWith Hatkhovei's first loan, she used the loan as a down-payment to purchase traditional wrap-round skirts from the local weavers. She did sell her products but not as efficiently as she would have thought. However, understanding the market and the fashion of the people, she gradually learnt to select better designs to sell and earn more. Some samples of her products can be seen hanging behind the members in the group photograph. She is happy that she has become a role model for her children and above all she is happy that her husband acknowledges all the support she renders towards the futures of her children. She is in a better position to command her business now and to help out two of her group members, who do weaving and would list out a catalogue to weave for them and place an order.\r\n\r\nHatkhovei has dreams and wishes to fulfill. She wishes to buy her husband a tractor machine to help plough his field. She also wishes to see her children grow up to be fine human beings. She longs for a good house to live in.\r\n\r\nHatkhovei needs another loan to continue with her tribal clothing business. With this loan she will buy more traditional wrap-round skirts to supply to the neighbouring states namely Nagaland. With Christmas coming,  demand for such products is very high. \r\n\r\nLikewise her group members too requested another loan to expand their inventory, clothing & food, with the demand of the holidays nearing.  \r\n   "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1246272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy traditional wrap-round skirts to sell in neighbouring states, namely Nagaland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Churachandpur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-02T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-01T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoikhochin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatkhovei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zorammawii","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemkhoneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhinngneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T04:14:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502482,"name":"Laizoma Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is LaizomA group consisting of five members. The group members belongs to a tribal community and hail from Churachanpur which is in Manipur state in the Northeastern part of India. In order to support themselves and contribute to the family income, they have formed a group to access a loan.\r\n\r\nHatkim is pictured with raised hand and she is the group leader. She is 59 years old and is a mother to six sons and two daughters. Unfortunately, two of her sons died some years back. All her children go to a private school at the nearby town. Her husband is a full-time pastor at their local church and his meager income could not suffice to support the family. In order to supplement the family income, Hatkim talked with her husband to initiate activities. With the help of some well-wishers, she managed to open a small general store by sacrificing a room in her house. Her initiative made her children very excited and happy at the same time because her children felt the negative impact of living off of charity.

Her husband cuts timber and supplies a carpentry workshop. So, her husband spends most of the time in the forest and visits the family on the weekend only. Before she accessed loans along with her older daughters (before they were married), she worked as a daily wage earner to meet the financial needs for the family. She is determined to educate the younger children and very happy that they are doing well with their studies. With her first loan she ventured into selling vegetables as a business. She barely managed to repay her loan. However things changed for the better with her second loan. With great determination, she used her second loan to buy fresh and organic vegetables. \r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to help her husband as well as for her own business. She will use part of her loan to hire labour to saw the timber logs into planks and the remaining loan to stock vegetables such as mustard leaves, fresh peas and local vegetables grown here in Manipur (sample local vegetables can be seen in the photograph). She will sell these vegetables in the market.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of her group members too have requested another loan to stock their inventory.

His work continues from April to October.\r\n\r\nIn the winter he doesn\u2019t have a job, so he runs a taxi business. His wife has been working as a cook in fast-food restaurants since 2006.

She is 45 years old and is a mother of two sons and a daughter. The children walk to a private school that is about one and half kilometers away. She never had the opportunity to go to school but as parents, she and her husband try their utmost effort to provide good education for the children. She means to enroll her oldest daughter in a nursing institute in the state next year. In order to reduce financial worries, she has been trying her luck from one trade to another.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan back in 2009, she managed to buy king chillies weighing 3 tons, which is equivalent to 1200 kilograms. She, along with her children, dried the chillies to repack for sale. The dried chillies can be preserved for a very long time. In this way, she has been selling chillies and managing the financial problems of the family. She is happy that her business has paid for the children's education.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to increase her business. The chilli plantation is usually harvested during the winter season. She will use most of the loan to buy more green raw chillies to dry and then sell for more profits once the chillies season ends and the selling price increases. She will use the lesser amount or about one-third of the loan for consumption purposes such as to buy new clothes for the children for Christmas.\r\n\r\nLikewise, rest of the group members have been struggling to do good with their respective income generating activities. Poultry farming, pig rearing, meat selling, grocery store, retailing business, tea stall, etc., are some of the highlights of the members activities. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1246300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy green chillies to dry and sell later and to purchase new winter clothes for the children.

Unfortunately, Mar\u00eda and her husband are apart from each other because Gregorio is currently living and working in Argentina: he has had to emigrate to another country for economic reasons. They are not a wealthy family and up to 3 years ago they did not have a place to live; they were living in two rented rooms and the were not very comfortable, but thanks to Gregorio and Mar\u00eda\u2019s work they have succeeded in buying some land on which they have been building a house little by little. Mar\u00eda is a cook in a public hospital, and on top of this they have a minibus with which they provide passenger services. This second activity represents an extra income as Mar\u00eda wage is very low. For this reason, the loan she is requesting will be used to change the operating system of her vehicle from gasoline to natural gas in order to save some money, as using gasoline is not economically good for her. Two of Mar\u00eda\u2019s most important dreams and goals are that her husband comes back from Argentina as soon as possible, so that they can be together again, and that her son finishes his

He works seven days a week, from 7 in the morning to 7 at night. From this activity, he supports his wife and his 4-year-old son whom are his great treasures. He is requesting a loan that will be invested in the purchase of raw materials like fabric and supplies for upholstery. One of the biggest difficulties for this young man is the economic factor, for not having had the opportunity to study he has always worked in his brother's business.

Her business is going well since they established the company.

Ariyalkham is planning to build her own house on their land next spring. So, she is asking for a loan of 5,400,000 MNT to purchase building materials like bricks, wood, and cement when the price of these materials are lowest. By doing this her family will have their own house, which will bring them happiness every single day. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ariyalkham plans to extend her house to make rental rooms for students because her land is located not far from downtown and near the paved road.

Bolangir district in Odisha, India to avail a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing business. Kanak is one of them. The lady standing on the extreme left in the photograph is Kanak. She is a very shy lady of 45 years who lives with her husband and one son who is 20 years old and studying in an engineering college out of state. She also has two daughters who are married and staying in their in-law\u2019s houses. The lady standing on the extreme right with her hand raised is Sujata, the leader of the group.\n\nKanak has been running a screen printing and polymer stamp making unit in her house with the help of her husband for the last 20 years. Kanak takes orders for printing invitation cards and making polymer stamps and supplies ready made invitation cards to the customers. Her daily net income in marriage season (December-June) is 2000 INR and in normal season is 500 to 1000 INR. Her husband purchases the materials like chemicals, paper, polymer, color etc from the nearest wholesale market in Bolangir. To help her with the screen printing, she has engaged two skilled workers. Due to the quality work and timely delivery, her business has name and fame in the locality.  With the loan, Kanak wants to purchase cards, polymer, color and chemicals in bulk to reduce the purchasing cost as she replenishes her stock frequently. Kanak says that with this business she married her two daughters in a befitting manner and was able to send her son to school for his engineering degree. Now she hopes to construct a pucca house as the present house is a tile one.\n \nThe other three members of the group are Sujata, Chandrama and Bhumi who run a General store, a Tent House and a fast food center.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1240486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase cards, polymer, color and chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Titilagarh,Bolangir,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-12-03T08:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-02T08:10:01Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sujata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T03:36:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499739,"name":"Geraldine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geraldine is a 29-year-old married woman and mother of two young children from Getafe, Bohol.

A customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with one-month-to-pay credit.

She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week.\n\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 23,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\n\nRemelina hopes to give her children a good and quality education and dreams for her family to have a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Both of them get a monthly salary.  \r\n\r\nAs the existing income is not enough for the family, Robert decided to start a new business.  In particular, he plans to renovate his house properly and rent the rooms. Robert has requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for a business start-up, but without any success.  His loan request was rejected each time because of lack of experience in his new business which is usually demanded by local credit providers.  \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved under the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.  The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.  With the requested loan, Robert will purchase building materials to renovate the house properly for satisfying the personal needs of his clients.  Robert hopes his business will be profitable and this will increase his income and the family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs, in order to improve their

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nPakuza sells her crop in the central bazaar. Her monthly income is 120 AZN. Her husband  is a builder, but he does not have a permanent job, and he actively helps her to raise the crops.\r\n\r\nAs these products are in high demand, Pakuza wants to expand the business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover the market demand. For this purpose she applied for 800 AZN. She will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.

People use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes are made of vegetables, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.  Her monthly income is 80 AZN. Raising crops is taking a lot of strength and working in the open air, which is very hard for her and that is why her son helps Brilyant. \r\n\r\nShe needs additional capital to purchase seeds and fertilizers. This will allow her to improve the quality of products that she raises and increase the monthly yield.  For this purpose she applied for 1600 AZN.

Fresh fruits are served on every table in Azerbaijan families and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nNazima sells her crop and fodder in the central bazaar and from her home.

capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles. Eufemia reside en el sector  de Chimbacalle, en la ferroviaria baja, un barrio ubicado en el sector sur de la ciudad, un sector con una alta actividad comercial que es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y que aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios. Los migrantes de varias provincias del pa\u00eds residen en este sector y ponen a prueba sus habilidades y destrezas para salir adelante con la puesta en marcha de negocios que son establecidos emp\u00edricamente en su mayor\u00eda. \nEufemia es una mujer de 60 a\u00f1os, trabajadora que nunca ha dejado de luchar por conseguir sus sue\u00f1os, termin\u00f3 el colegio y luego se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar porque la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en su hogar no le pod\u00eda proveer los estudios superiores. Siendo joven se cas\u00f3 y tuvo 3 hijos que ahora son adultos Edison de 42 a\u00f1os, Patricio de 40 y Juan Carlos de 32. Eufemia ahora est\u00e1 divorciada y vive sola, pero considera que independientemente de su situaci\u00f3n puede salir adelante y la prueba de eso es que hace 4 a\u00f1os abri\u00f3 un lugar peque\u00f1o en el cual vende comida r\u00e1pida y tradicional que era muy demandada en el lugar por estudiantes, vecinos y trabajadores del sector. Esta actividad le ha ayudado a tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y adem\u00e1s puede disfrutar en sus tiempos libres de sus familiares. En ocho horas del d\u00eda, Eufemia asea los alimentos, los prepara y atiende a cada cliente que llega. Ahora con la experiencia que ha adquirido est\u00e1 segura de que puede hacer crecer su negocio, por lo que acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quien a trav\u00e9s de Kiva, le otorgan un cr\u00e9dito para que ella compre mercader\u00eda como golosinas o productos de consumo inmediato que se puedan combinar o complementar con el servicio que ella presta.  Eufemia espera incrementar sus ingresos para mantener un ahorro que lo pueda utilizar en los a\u00f1os que su edad y las complicaciones de salud que esto conlleva ya no le permitan trabajar.","en":"Just a little while ago, the southern part of the city of Quito was no considered one of the economic strongholds of the Ecuadorian capital. Now this area is an economic force in the city. There are enterprising families in this place that have fought to stand out. There are natives and migrants from other cities and countries, and it has been a meeting point for people from various provinces. It has extensive streets. \r\n\r\nEufemia lives in the Chimbacalle area, in Ferroviaria Baja, a neighborhood located in the southern part of the city, an area with a lot of commercial activity that keeps growing and greatly contributes to the economic growth of the city. The parks with their large green areas stand out in this zone. Families go to them on weekends. There is access to all kinds of services and its inhabitants are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself when it comes to setting up new businesses. Migrants from various provinces of the country live here and they put their skills to the test to move forward by setting up businesses, most of which are established through experience. \r\n\r\nEufemia, 60, is a hard-working woman who has never stopped fighting to achieve her dreams. She finished high school and then started working, because the economic situation in her household did not permit her to study further. While young, she married and had three sons who are now grown: Edison, 42, Patricio, 40, and Juan Carlos, 32. Eufemia is now divorced and lives alone, but she believes that she can move forward regardless of her situation. The proof of this is that four years ago, she opened a small place in which she sells traditional fast foods, which were in high demand by the students, residents, and workers in the area. This activity has helped to give her economic stability and she can also enjoy free time with her relatives. \r\n\r\nFor eight hours a day, Eufemia cleans the foods, prepares them and attends to each one of her customers. Now with the experience she has gained, she is sure she will be able to grow her business, which is why she went to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa through Kiva.

Thanks to the good service she provides, she is certain that her life will continue to be as good as it is today.\r\n\r\nBecause Veronica needs to buy more materials in order to sell, she decided to reach out to INTEGRAL and buy: corn, sugar, chicken, beans, and salt, among other things. She wants to have the best products to keep her shop in business and to provide her clients with the best. She thanks God because she knows that the help will soon arrive and she will continue to be an example for her family and for those that admire her.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1247251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn, sugar, chicken, beans, and salt, among other things.

People use meat in everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma and always use yogurt sauce. Milk products are considered very healthy and common in everyday life.  \r\n \r\nThis is only one income in his family, and it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.

Having started with 30,000 som (KGS) in 2007, the farm today brings in around 20,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy products and reselling livestock. Thanks to Gulzat's persistent work, her farm today counts three cows and 15 sheep. \n\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulzat turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of sheep at a very low price. Gulzat plans to invest the income in further growing her business through increasing the amount of livestock. She plans to build a house in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":637.5,"image":{"id":1247018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jygach-Korgon village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-12-03T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-02T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":637.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":30126.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776934,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T14:21:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503174,"name":"Youssouf","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 vers  Novembre 1976 \u00e0 Kati, Monsieur  Youssouf est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant.

Los integrantes comentan que eligieron dicho nombre pues tardaban mucho en decidirlo cuando empez\u00f3 a atardecer y alguien finalmente propuso el nombre. Francisca quien es una integrante del grupo, com\u00fanmente conocida como Mary, tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Gustavo desde hace 20 a\u00f1os y han formado una familia con dos hijas una de ellas se encuentra aun estudiando una carrera universitaria. La se\u00f1ora Mary tiene una tienda de abarrotes desde hace 15 a\u00f1os  y la inicio porque quer\u00eda ayudar con los gastos del hogar, Do\u00f1a Mary comenta \u201cInici\u00e9 vendiendo afuera de mi casa dulces solo en una mesita chica donde pon\u00eda diferentes tipos de dulces pero poco a poco fui vendiendo m\u00e1s productos como huevo, leche, pan etc. Estos productos los compraban las se\u00f1oras y con los dulces me iba muy bien ya que cada vez que pasaban los ni\u00f1os me compraban, con el tiempo decidimos poner un local ya mejor establecido y gracias al cr\u00e9dito he podido levantarla poco a poco\u201d. Esta vez la se\u00f1ora Mary esta solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para poder abastecer su tienda de abarrotes ya que con el cr\u00e9dito otorgado podr\u00e1 comprar mas leche, huevo, pan, aceite, frijoles, lentejas,  etc. Aunque una de las dificultades de Do\u00f1a Mary es la falta de dinero para poder seguir invirtiendo m\u00e1s en su tienda de abarrotes porque muchas veces se le termina muy r\u00e1pido su mercanc\u00eda y mas los productos que se consumen. A pesar de las dificultades que tiene que superar Mary, su sue\u00f1o es que su peque\u00f1a tienda pueda llegar a convertirse en un gran s\u00faper porque a\u00ed podr\u00e1 solventar los gastos de la educaci\u00f3n de su hija Bianca para que pueda terminar su carrera en comunicaci\u00f3n. As\u00ed como Mary, tambi\u00e9n los dem\u00e1s integrantes tienen sus actividades: In\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n invertir\u00e1 en su tienda de abarrotes, V\u00edctor y Eva invertir\u00e1n en borregos, M\u00f3nica y Maricela invertir\u00e1n en la venta de ropa, Graciela invertir\u00e1 en dulces y finalmente \u00c1ngeles invertir\u00e1 para en su recicladora. Todo el grupo est\u00e1 muy contento y agradecido por los \u00e9xitos obtenidos en su familia y en sus negocios gracias al cr\u00e9dito que VisionFund y Kiva les otorga.","en":"The \u201cEl Atardecer\u201d (Dusk) group has been working with the institution for several loan cycles, although it has gradually increased the number of members. The members say that they chose this name, as they were taking a very long time in deciding it when it began to get dark, and someone proposed the name. \r\n\r\nFrancisca is a member of the group, and is commonly known as Mary. She is 40 years old, and has been married to Gustavo for 20 years. They have created a family, with two daughters; one of them still at university. Mary has had a grocery store for 15 years, and started it because she wanted to help with the household expenses. \r\n\r\nMary says, \"I started selling candy outside my home, just at a small table where I put various types of candy, but gradually I started selling more products such as eggs, milk, bread, etc. The ladies bought these products, and the candy sales were going well, as each time the children passed by they would buy. With time, we decided to set up a shop, now better established, and thanks to the loan, I have been able to build it up little by little.\"  \r\n\r\nThis time, Mary is requesting the loan so that she can stock her grocery store, as with the loan she has been granted she will be able to buy more milk, eggs, bread,  cooking oil, beans, lentils, etc. One of Mary's difficulties is lack of money to be able to continue investing more in her grocery store, because many times the merchandise runs out very quickly, especially the products used daily. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the difficulties Mary has to overcome, her dream is that her small store can eventually become a large minimart. That way she will be able to cover her daughter Bianca's education expenses, so that she can finish her degree in communications. \r\n\r\nAlong with Mary, the other group members also have their activities: In\u00e9s will also invest in her grocery store, Victor and Eva will invest in shhep, M\u00f3nica and Maricela will invest in the sale of clothing, Graciela will invest in candy, and finally, \u00c1ngeles will invest in her recycling center.\r\n\r\nThe entire group is very happy and grateful for the successes obtained in their families and businesses, thanks to the credit that VisionFund and Kiva grant them.

Su padre falleci\u00f3 cuando ten\u00eda 15 a\u00f1os, y su madre trabaja como empleada dom\u00e9stica. Actualmente vive con ella y sus 4 hermanos menores.\n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 su historia:\n\nEn Colombia se vive una gran paradoja: somos el segundo pa\u00eds m\u00e1s rico en flora y fauna, y poseemos minerales en gran cantidad, pero contamos con los \u00edndices de pobreza m\u00e1s altos de toda Latinoam\u00e9rica, y los niveles de rendimiento escolar m\u00e1s bajo. Es as\u00ed como se evidencia la poca pertinencia de la educaci\u00f3n en esta regi\u00f3n. \nMi madre siempre me ha recalcado: \u201cNo importa lo mucho que sepas, si no lo pones al servicio de quien lo necesita,\u201d y es por eso que creo que realizar una Maestr\u00eda en Pol\u00edticas y Administraci\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n no tendr\u00eda ning\u00fan sentido, sino es puesta con fines de mejorar las condiciones educativas que hoy en d\u00eda se viven en mi pueblo natal, Choc\u00f3 y Colombia.

To pay for his Bachelor degree in English and French in the university he worked first as an assistant in a grocery store, then as a private watchman and finally as a pizza cook at a fast-food restaurant.  His father died when he was 15-years-old and his mother works as a domestic employee.  He currently lives with her and his four younger siblings.  This is his story:\r\n\r\nA great paradox is lived in Colombia: we are the second-richest country in flora and fauna and we possess minerals in great amounts but we have one of the highest poverty indexes in all Latin America and educational outcomes are among the lowest which show how little pertinence education has in this region.\r\n\r\nMy mother has always stressed: \u201cIt\u2019s not important how much you know if you don\u2019t put it to use serving those most in need,\u201d and this is why I believe that getting a Master\u2019s in Education Policy and Administration would make no sense if not aimed at improving the educational conditions existent today in my place of birth, in Choc\u00f3 and in Colombia.  In my understanding, a pertinent education does exist when it\u2019s aimed at exploiting all the abilities and realities the residents in a region have and directing them towards that region\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nAt my return to Colombia, I see myself generating new educational policies that will be aimed at a more pertinent education that will be focused on regional needs rather than on copies of foreign models that do not adjust to our own realities thus promoting the use of our strengths.\r\n\r\nWhenever I\u2019ve wanted to do something, I\u2019ve been able to and being a Kiva beneficiary would prove once more that where there\u2019s a will a path will always appear.

She studied through preparatory school level and is a single mother with a small son. Yessica notes that she has always worked to help her parents with household expenses. Now that she has become a mother, of course, she had to search for a way to earn a little more money in order to offer her son a quality life and, in the future, a chance to study. Therefore, with the help of her family, she began to work in her own business. Yessica has established a small cyber cafe in her home.\r\n\r\nYessica is very content, not just because she has her own business, but because through her cyber cafe, she is offering a service to many young people whose community is somewhat remote and who lack access to this type of service. She says that, thank God, with just 2 months in business, little by little, customers have begun to appear. She also notes that sometimes she has to teach some of customers to use the service but she does so with much pleasure, knowing that this will help attract more people to use her business. \r\n\r\nShe will invest this loan in purchasing printer paper, cartridges, and in the maintenance of computer equipment.
