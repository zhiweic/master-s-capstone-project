After the death of her husband, the family provider, Nurjamal became involved in farming and animal husbandry in search of a source of income for the family.  She started the business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her strenuous and capacious work, Nurjamal achieved small successes in developing the business and started to earn a monthly profit in the amount of 10,000 som (KGS).  Today, her business contains 2 dairy cows, 22 sheep, 8 goats and 1 horse.  She also has a land plot of 4.20 hectares, where she plants beans.  Her two sons help with the business.  The oldest son is working in Russia.  He helps financially by sending his salary to the family in Kyrgyzstan every month.  In order to further develop her business, Nurjamal requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the Microfinance Bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy mineral fertilizers and fuel for treating the land.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further developing her small business and also plans to build a new house in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":105,"image":{"id":1385125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy mineral fertilizers and fuel for treating the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ken-Aral village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurjamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":5121.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426931,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-22T19:01:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581203,"name":"Fakhria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fakhria, who appears in the picture, is a 24-year-old single woman who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

Gulchehra was born into the family of a \"dehkan\" farmer; her parents were poor and weren't able to provide her with a good education. After graduation high school, Gulchehra helped her father work in the fields and provide for her family. \r\n\r\nToday, Gulchehra has her own family to take care of. She wants her children to have a good life. So for the past 16 years, Gulchehra has managed her own retail business, which focuses on buying and selling women's shoes. She's able to sell goods quickly, making her business profitable. Meanwhile, her husband works as a farmer, growing various grain crops, which significantly supplements their family budget. In order to improve their quality of life, Gulchehra wants to expand her business and gain more profit. Therefore, she approached Arvand with a request for a loan to buy more women's shoes for resale. She's hoping for your help.

Despite the loss of business caused by riots in 2010, Toktokan was able to survive and further develop her business.  With the goal of further growth, Toktokan turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a new, innovated sewing machine.

After investing the funds in her business, Tea hopes to generate additional revenue and invest the profits to further develop her business. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":952.51,"image":{"id":1385372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to start up a clothing trading business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gori","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":186.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":192.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":195.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":201.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":205.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":210.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":217.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220.39},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":226.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":231.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":236.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.01},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.01},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175.01,"local_amount":175.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":175.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857552,"comment":null},{"amount":186.84,"local_amount":186.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":186.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134201,"comment":null},{"amount":192.92,"local_amount":192.92,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":192.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107785,"comment":null},{"amount":195.87,"local_amount":195.87,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":195.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255322,"comment":null},{"amount":201.87,"local_amount":201.87,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":201.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019456,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-07T16:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581890,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta es madre soltera vive con su hijo de 8 meses en casa alquilada, ella posee una tienda desde hace 1 a\u00f1os, vende golosinas, huevos, sopas, granos b\u00e1sicos, refrescos, etc. tiene muy buena clientela ya que la tienda la tiene surtida con productos que sus clientes necesitan, con las ganancias que obtiene cubre algunos gastos mas necesarios de su casa como agua, luz y pago de casa, por esa raz\u00f3n la clienta esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder comprar mas mercader\u00eda y surtir mas su tienda para obtener mejores ganancias y asi seguir solventado los gastos que se le presenten en su hogar y tambi\u00e9n poder darle a su hijo lo que necesita sin limitaci\u00f3n alguna.

is a 41-year-old man from a small village in the Gurjaani district, Kakheti Region, East Georgia. He lives with his brother Aleksandre, who is 45 years old. Because he is an invalid, Aleksandre is provided with a monthly pension from government institutions. \r\nNaskida applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were always rejected, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nNaskida is involved in agricultural activities. In particular, he has a vineyard and sells the harvested grapes at local markets. Besides that, he has a plot of agricultural land where tomatoes are grown. Naskida also works as a laborer and helps his fellow villagers by doing agricultural work for fees. He is a very hardworking man and does his best to increase his family\u2019s income, but his income is hardly enough to provide food for the family. \r\nAccording to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Naskida requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Naskida has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit Naskida will buy calves. As calves are purchased, he will raise them and produce dairy products in the future. This will be an additional source of income for them to buy all the medicine for his brother. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1385365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase calves to be used to produce dairy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gurjaani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:40:08Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naskida","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":400.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255321,"comment":null},{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":800.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019455,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-15T01:59:47Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:45:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581316,"name":"Salim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salim is a 30-year-old married man and has two children, who live in Taiz, Yemen.

","en":"Tochy is a very kind and open-hearted woman. She is 54 years old, married, and has two sons. Tochy grew up in a poor family in a rural area and got married not far from where she grew up. Her husband Bakhron did not learn a trade or profession and performs unskilled labor. He works on constuction sites and earns a small amount of money. Her adult sons work in Russia because they could not find permanent jobs in Tajikistan. Tochy has raised cattle for over 35 years. She has extensive experience breeding cattle and runs her own business. She sells cattle at the local market and has repeat customers. Tochy began building a new house because the one they live in now is small. She wants her second son to get married, but he and his wife would have nowhere to live. Her sons sent her all of the money they had saved up over the past year, but it wasn't enough to build the house. This is why she has asked for a loan of 4000 somoni to purchase construction materials such as cement, wood, and so forth to build the new house. She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1385189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy building materials for building a new house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-07-11T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-10T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tochy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":9.7,"local_amount":45.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550377,"comment":null},{"amount":840.3,"local_amount":3954.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4006.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228160,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T19:50:31Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T10:02:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":581319,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 38 years old.

is a 44-year-old woman from a small village in Khashuri district. She is married and lives with her husband, two children (13 and 14 years old) and her mother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Her children go to a local school. Maia applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nThe only source of income for the family is from agriculture. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used to make cheese products. Maia produces cheese every day and sells it at local markets at a good price. The income is hardly enough for food for the family. \r\nAccording to Credo\u2019s evaluation, the family belongs to the \u201csubsistence poor\u201d category. Maia applied for a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Maia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the credit, Maia will begin trading in clothing and bed-linens. She plans to go to Turkey and buy clothing and bed-linens from wholesalers and then to resell them at higher prices among her villagers. This will give her a chance to increase her family's income.

He lives in a rural area and wants to repair his house and create better living conditions for the winter because the winter weather is very cold, and his district is expected to have limitations on electricity.  He has a decent and happy family.  Jamshed has two children.  His wife is a very kind and pure woman.  Jamshed has been involved in animal husbandry for over 15 years because the climate and conditions in his place of residence are quite good for animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops.  Jamshed's wife helps him with running the business.  Jamshed and his family have been planning to repair their house, but do not have money.  This plan became a big dream for his family, and the reality of this dream is such that Jamshed is requesting a loan in the amount of 3000 somoni to purchase construction materials, such as cement, wood, etc., to repair his house.  He awaits your kindness and hopes for your

Residents of the city love eating fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n\r\nBetty is married with seven children between one and 16 years old, only five of whom are in school and live at home. She did not go to school, but she is good at managing her business. For the past three years, she has been selling slippers in the local market. She started this business with a little amount from her mother and she learned this business from her. She likes how people respond to her business, and mostly she enjoys the interaction with her customers. She spends eight hours with her business, six day a week.  She is requesting a loan to purchase more slippers for her business. She hopes to get more money and build a

Residents of the city love eating fufu (cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.) Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n\nSiah and her fiance stay together. She did not go to school. She has three children between 8 and 1 years old. Two of her children are in school and they all live at home. For the past four years, she has been selling rubber dishes (bowls, cups, spoons, plates, etc.) in the local market in order to help her children. She started this business by selling for her mother, and she learned this business from her. She likes her business because of the ways people respond to it. She is requesting a loan to purchase more rubber dishes for her business in hopes of having more money to sustain her family.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":94.95,"image":{"id":1380496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

is a 40-year-old businesswoman from Liberia.  She is married and has three children, between 25 and 16 years old.  Only two are currently attending school, and they all live at home.  Finna did go to school, but engages in business to help herself.  She describes herself as a hard-working woman.\n\nShe lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County. It is located by the sea.  It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city.  Residents of the city love eating 'fufu,' a dish made from a cassava-based dough that is typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city speak Bassa, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\n \nFinna has a table business, where she has sold pepper, oil, bitter-ball, okra and other food ingredients, for the past three years. She started her business with money she got from her husband.  She works at her business from 8:00AM to 4:00PM each day.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more pepper, oil, bitter-ball, okra and other food ingredients to resell at her table.  She likes her business, because it helps her to support her home.  \n\nFinna hopes one day to own a house. She wants to thank the Kiva lenders, in advance, for their help.

She is married and lives with her son, daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, who is provided with a retirement pension. Tsitsino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a pig, 2 milking cows and 2 calves. Tsitsino produces dairy products for selling. Her son has rented a bus and works on the bus line. Their income is hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nTsitsino has requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Tsitsino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

Soon after, she returned to the United States to marry Gil.  Emilie is passionate about teaching children and she spent several years doing so in Paris and Montreal.  Upon her arrival, she obtained her teaching certification here in San Diego, in order to begin teaching in her new hometown.  A year after getting settled in San Diego, Emilie and Gil welcomed their son Mateo (pictured center), another driving force in their desire to create this home-based school!\n\nEmilie learned of the Montessori method while teaching in France and Canada. Her younger sister also attended a Montessori school, and she was impressed with its impact. \u201cI watched my sister blossom and witnessed such growth and independence in her,\u201d she shared. Emilie and Gil were initially motivated by a desire to provide a learning environment for their son. \u201cWe really believe in a peaceful environment where children can learn life skills and grow up to be independent and productive,\u201d said Emilie. The idea to set up a French Montessori school made sense to Emilie and Gil, seeing as Emilie is fluent in French and English and that it will be the first French Montessori School in San Diego. \n\n\u201cShe says she wants a big family,\u201d Gil shared with a smile. Emilie is on track to have just that, as when the school opens in September, Emilie will have six students between the ages of two and four in her home. The plan is to hire a teaching assistant next year and have as many as 12 students in her program.\n\nA loan of $7,000 helps Emilie to purchase Montessori materials for her school and upgrade her home to house the school.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":899.24,"image":{"id":1381331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

She describes herself as hardworking businesswoman.\r\n\r\nShe lives and works in Paynesville North, which has the largest market in Montserrado County. The area is home to \u201cround time marketers,\" the local term for traders who travel to the interior regions of the country to purchase goods to sell throughout the county. Because of this, there is a large number of wholesalers operating in the area that distribute to the markets in the county, including supplying the capital city of Monrovia. \r\n\r\nFor the past four years, Siah has run a table business which sells used clothes. She works 11 hours at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is having little capital. She intends to use the loan to buy used clothes for her business. She started her business by money from her fianc\u00e9.  She likes her business because she makes more profit. She hopes one day to own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advance for their help.

She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nJennifer dreams of expanding her business and having more items in her store. She meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1385657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries, and beverages needed for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534926,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5075.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784319,"comment":null},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T08:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410771306,"comment":null},{"amount":46.67,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2030.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419824355,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-12T21:19:31Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T13:12:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582248,"name":"Jose Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 Antonio, es un joven de 25 a\u00f1os habitante del barrio Laureles Norte, una zona marginal de Managua.

Ahora vive con sus hijos en La Concordia un cant\u00f3n de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas que anteriormente pertenec\u00eda a la Provincia de Esmeraldas. Es considerado un cant\u00f3n muy fuerte en la agroindustria y exportaci\u00f3n de varios productos como palma africana, macadamia y palmito por lo cual un aproximado de m\u00e1s de 300 millones de d\u00f3lares se mueven solo en este cant\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n el turismo es una fuente de econom\u00eda, pues hay lugares que son visitados y los habitantes del pueblo aprovechan este movimiento para comercializar todo tipo de productos con negocios establecidos en cada rinc\u00f3n como restaurantes, tiendas, farmacias, almacenes de ropa, tours, etc.\nGabriela aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven las labores del campo y se especializ\u00f3 en los cultivos de maracuy\u00e1 y cacao, dos frutos que tienen alta demanda en la zona y son cultivados en muchos terrenos, pues el clima del lugar se presta para esta producci\u00f3n. Es por esto que desde hace 2 a\u00f1os Gabriela dedica al menos 6 horas cada d\u00eda en la producci\u00f3n de cacao y maracuy\u00e1 que posteriormente vende en el mercado de la zona o bajo pedidos de varios clientes. En medio de varias actividades complejas, Gabriela ha ganado mucha experiencia y necesita incrementar su producci\u00f3n, pues mientras sus hijos crecen ella debe incurrir en gastos mayores. \nCon el objetivo de aumentar cultivos y mejorar la calidad de los ya existentes, Gabriela solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en semillas y abono con lo cual aumentar\u00e1 la producci\u00f3n y por ende sus ganancias ser\u00e1n mayores, de esta forma podr\u00e1 ofrecer a sus hijos un mejor estilo de vida y adem\u00e1s podr\u00e1 brindarles la educaci\u00f3n que ella no pudo terminar y as\u00ed hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de un d\u00eda poder  verlos obteniendo su t\u00edtulo profesional. \nEn anteriores ocasiones, Gabriela no hab\u00eda podido acceder a los cr\u00e9ditos de instituciones financieras, sin embargo gracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa y su producto Kiva ha podido contar con el apoyo que ella tanto esperaba y por el cual agradece de antemano a aquellas personas que en varias partes del mundo se unen a sus sue\u00f1os para hacerlos realidad.","en":"Gabriela is 29 years old.  She is the mother of two children who are six and two whom she hopes to see grow up with the best health, education, and stability.  They are why she applies herself every day in spite of the barriers that many people put in front of her because of her lack of education, as she dropped out of secondary school and started working.  She currently lives with her children in La Concordia, a canton of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas that used to be part of the Esmeraldas Province.  It is known as a canton that is very big on agro-industry and the exportation of various produce, such as African oil palms, macadamias, and fan palms, which is why over 300 million dollars move through this canton alone.  Tourism is also a source of income, as there are areas that attract visitors and the locals take advantage of this to sell all kinds of products with businesses on every corner, such as restaurants, stores, pharmacies, clothing outlets, tours, etc.  \r\n\r\nGabriela learned to work in the fields as a very young girl and she specialized in passion fruit and cacao, two fruits that are in high demand in the area and which are grown on a lot of land, as the area's climate lends itself to these crops.  That is why for two years now Gabriela has spent at least six hours a day on her cacao and passion fruit crops, which she then sells at the local market or to customers who place orders.  Gabriela has gained a lot of experience through all of her complex activities and she needs to increase her yield, as her expenses will grow with her children.    \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her crops and improve the quality of the ones she has, Gabriela is asking for a loan to invest in seed and fertilizer with which to increase her harvest, which will in turn increase her profits.

Actualmente vive en la parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nLuego de una larga trayectoria como comerciante, Jos\u00e9 decidi\u00f3 emprender en la labor que hab\u00eda aprendido como profesi\u00f3n que es la herrer\u00eda, la cual la realiza desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, es un trabajo que le gusta mucho pues al ver que nadie dar\u00eda uso a metales viejos que para muchas personas no son m\u00e1s que chatarra, Jos\u00e9 los somete al fuego y con su creatividad fabrica piezas que sirven como implementos de decoraci\u00f3n de hogares.

He is single and grew up in a home with few economic resources, so he had to start working at a very young age in order to help with the household costs. Because of this, he was only able to finish elementary school and has had to get by with this limited education in the various jobs he has taken on. He currently lives in the Rio Verde de Santo Domingo parish, the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, a city that has considerable business enterprises because it has become a place of exchange between the coast and the highlands. The several tourist attractions, as well as the hot climate, are a major draw for tourists from Ecuador and around the world. The majority of the residents have some sort of business enterprise or provide services for residents and tourists.\r\nAfter a long career in business, Jos\u00e9 decided to start a business doing what he had learned to do as a career: to be a blacksmith. He has done this work for seven years now. He loves his job. Seeing that no one uses old metal that is nothing more than scrap for many people, Jos\u00e9 puts it into the fire and uses his creativity to create pieces that serve to decorate homes. He is very proud of his finished pieces, and this motivates him to continue expanding his business. However, as in all jobs, there is a health risk because of the metal residues he is exposed to, and because of the temperature changes. Because of this, some time ago Jos\u00e9 suffered an accident that made it impossible for him to work for several months. However, once he recovered, he started again with new motivations.\r\nHis dream is to establish a store where he will be able to sell pieces he has made with his own hands. He is working hard to reach this dream. He will start with this loan, which he will invest in the purchase of metal, scraps, and tools which will allow him to increase production and thus expand his clientele. This step will get him closer to his dream. Jos\u00e9 is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for opening its doors to him so that he can expand his business, and also for believing in the dreams of people in rural areas.

Besides that, the family grows haricot beans, maize and potatoes and uses the harvested product for feeding. \r\nElene applied for loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan applications were always rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nHer loan application was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits on soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low incomes. With the credit, Elene will buy various cosmetics, including talcs, body lotions, perfumes and face powders. She will distribute these products among her friends and neighbors.

Some 10 years ago, the couple became unemployed and decided to find an alternative means to generate income.\r\n\r\nInitially, with money they received for their work termination, they traveled to the municipality of Maicao, Guajira department, a frontier zone where many merchants go to purchase groceries and non-perishable food products at favorable prices to later sell at retail, mainly among barrio residents, friends, and acquaintances.  \r\n\r\nLittle by little, Clara acquired new customers who came soliciting all kinds of different articles, including food, clothing, shoes, and domestic electrical appliances, among others. She extended credit for up to 45 days, a means of selling that they still employ. Last June, she made her 1st loan request but it expired due to time limits.\r\n\r\nNow, once again, Clara is applying for a loan, her 1st from Kiva. The funds will be used to purchase catalog items (colognes, creams, deodorants, shampoos) solicited by her customers. Her business is a family affair, organized so that each member is in charge of a segment of customers, thus assuring good attention.\r\n\r\nClara's dedication and efforts have been fundamental factors in reaching her goals, turning difficulties into an opportunity to get ahead. One of her short term objectives is to complete construction of her house, for which she has been working in recent years alongside her family.

In particular, she has a plot of agricultural land where different kinds of fruits are grown. Such as: peach trees, plum trees, cornel trees and strawberries. Sopio and her daughter look after the fruit to insure in a good harvest. Besides, Sopio has a flat which is rented out and she gets 200 Gel per month. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nSopio requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Sopio has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Sopio will begin selling clothing and household goods. She will purchase clothing and household goods from wholesalers and then resell at a higher price. In addition, Sopio plans to purchase a stock of wood, which will be much more expensive in wintertime. This will increase the income of her family.

His farm generates about five jobs during the years.  \r\n\r\nHis objective in requesting this loan is to guarantee adequate care for his coffee plants in order to prevent infestations and illnesses that are possible in this line of work.  His goal is to plant five more manzanas of coffee in 2014 to gradually increase his income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1387965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

This profit will allow her to repay her loan and to help her husband with the daily expenses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1385938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farm inputs and seeds, and to pay for plowing during the farming season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bladi\u00e8","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-07-12T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-08-11T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diatou Sanali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karatou Defina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Yacouba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabintou Labass ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-08T23:21:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":582307,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El cliente vive en casa propia con su compa\u00f1era de vida y su hija, el se dedica  al servicio de transporte de carga,  tiene varios a\u00f1os de realizar esa actividad, muchas personas lo buscan por ser amable, trabajador y responsable a la hora de realizar los viajes, trabaja en todas las colonias y cantones de donde el reside, con las ganancias que obtiene de su trabajo logra solventar los gastos que se le presentan en su hogar, el cliente est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para poder pagar ayudante para realizar el trabajo y reparaciones que necesita su cami\u00f3n ya que esa es su \u00fanica fuente de trabajo y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 seguir llevando el pan diario a su hogar sin limitaci\u00f3n alguna.","en":"The client lives in his own house with his partner and daughter.
