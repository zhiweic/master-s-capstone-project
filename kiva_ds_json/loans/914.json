been involved in an agricultural business in the Bekh village of the Syunik region for 25 years.  She keeps chickens, grows vegetables, fruits and nuts on her farm.  She sells her agricultural products, such as eggs, nuts, vegetables and fruits, in the city of Kapan.  Thanks to the profit from running the farm, Larisa has the ability to support her family.  Larisa is 56 years old.  She graduated from a financial-economics college and currently works, parallel to her agricultural business, as an accountant at a retirement fund.  Larisa is married and has three children: two daughters and a son.  Both of her daughters are married and live away from the parents, and the son is married as well, but lives together with his family and the parents.  Larisa's son works at a military base and also helps Larisa with the farm.  Larisa's husband works as a forest ranger at a forestry and also helps his wife with the farm during his free time.  Larisa has obtained loans from the Nor Horizon organization twice before and now needs a loan in the amount of $1,350 to purchase a horse and hay for it for the winter.  Larisa is certain that the horse is very necessary for her farm.  It would be possible to bring wood and the like from unreachable by car places with the help of a horse.\r\n

His agricultural business started with growing vegetables in a greenhouse on his 10 sotkas land plot by his house and sowing cereal crops on 10 hectares of leased land.  To ease his work, Sergey decided to purchase mechanized farming equipment, a furrower and a mower for cutting weeds.  This equipment will also allow to quickly and with quality treat the soil on the land plot by his house, which expanded to 25 sotkas.  Sergey's future plans include growing grapes in a greenhouse, and his personal plans include building a new house.

The oldest son is 37 years old, and the youngest is 20 years old, and both of them work at an auto service shop.  Olga started her farming business with 10 sotkas of family land share.  Today, her farm consists of five hectares of land.  She decided to purchase plastic for a mini greenhouse in order to increase the strawberry harvest.  She also needs to purchase a mower to combat weeds.  Olga's business plans are to expand the sowing of strawberries to six hectares and install a greenhouse on 400 square meters.

The father of 4 children, he is married and lives in a traditional family setting in Loulouni. He has bought and sold household utensils (made from plastic or aluminium) for over 6 years. His experience in this area has earned him a good reputation and a good volume of orders, particularly for items such as cups, plates, kettles, buckets and bathtubs.\r\n\r\nAdama started working together with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution over 3 years ago, in order to have enough resources to satisfy his customer demand. This is his 5th loan cycle and all 4 previous loans have been properly repaid. This new loan will allow him to buy cups, kettles, plates and bathtubs. He gets his supplies in Sikasso. Once the items have been transported to Loulouni, they are put in his shop and then sold for cash or credit to a retail customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan, Adama expects to make an average monthly profit of 100 000 francs. This profit will allow him to make the interest payments on his loan, and the rest will be reinvested in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":1127317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy various items for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-08-01T07:01:34Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-31T07:01:34Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152827.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301503019,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76413.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268648,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76413.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315499044,"comment":null},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":76413.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102978,"comment":null},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":76413.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243256,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-15T21:18:58Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":443160,"name":"Iman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iman is a 36-year-old married woman from Bani Kenanah, Irbid, Jordan who supports five family members.

She lives with her husband in the military camp in S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAssitan didn't have the opportunity to attend school for social reasons (she was adopted by her grandparents who saw school as a waste of time for young girls).  She says that all she knows in life is commerce which she learned on her own.  She is now well known in her field and has a lot of experience.  She is very shrewd and knows how to keep her customers.  \r\n\r\nWith the aim of increasing her working capital in order to make more profits, Assitan has turned to Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been working with the institution for 69 months.  She has taken out eight group loans and three individual loans which have all been repaid correctly.  This is her fourth individual loan and she will use it to buy 5 tons of millet.  She stocks up on site from local producers.\r\n\r\nAssitan sells mainly for cash to re-sellers who come from large towns such as Bamako. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Assitan intends to make a monthly profit of 150,000 francs.

After five group loans which were all repaid in full, she is now on her third individual loan (and the two previous loans were fully repaid). She is planning to buy 10 \"pagnes-wax\", two dozen of ready-to-wear outfits for children and one carton of liquid soap. She gets her supplies from wholesalers in Koutiala and sells at the Grand Market to a customer base made up of women and often men, for cash. By boosting her business, she is expecting to make an average monthly profit of 60,000FCFA, which she plans to use to pay the interest on the Soro Yiriwaso loan and to contribute to family expenses; the remainder will be reinvested in her business. Mariam is very courageous and motivated and is still counting on getting funding from Soro to become a wholesaler.

She comments that she had a grocery store before, with which she began her life as a businesswoman, but not having much experience she encountered various problems, one of which was extending a lot of credit to her customers. She thinks she didn't handle it well and so it went badly. Also the competition increased and so her sales went down, so she decided to close the shop and with the money she opened a stationery store. She has had the business for nine years and it's going better for her because there is no competition in her area. Added to all this, her son opened an Internet shop next door and so the two businesses complement one another. \r\n\r\nShe opens the stationery store every day Monday to Saturday. Her husband helps her staff the shop since he drives a truck and when he doesn't have a load he has free time. With the loan she is seeking she plans to purchase merchandise such as notebooks, papers, colored art paper, pens, construction paper and erasers among other items. With the loan she is seeking she hopes to finish the second story of her home in order to rent it out and so bring in extra income.
