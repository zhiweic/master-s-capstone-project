She works as a teacher of Kyrgyz language in the Bokonbaevo village school, but she also raises animals in order to supplement her teacher's salary. She began this business with a sum of 20,000 soms and today, due to her hard work, she owns 2 cows, 30 sheep and 2.08 hectares of land she uses to cultivate potatoes and cock's head, which serves as fodder for her herd. Her monthly income from the business is about 10,000 soms. \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Baktygul approached \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" with a request for a loan 110,000 soms (KGS). This loan would allow her to purchase some livestock for fattening and resale. She plans to invest profits from the loan back into her business and build up some savings so that she could pay for her son Sirgat and her daughter Nyrjamal to go to college.

Nana earns a living by caring for two milk cows, whose output allows her to make cheese every day for sale in the local market. The family's total average monthly income is 900 Lari. Nana and and her husband work hard but are unable to earn enough money to set aside savings to buy household goods they need or to renovate their house.  \r\n\r\nNana has requested a loan to buy a new milk cow. With three cows, she will be able to produce and sell more dairy products, such as cheese, curds and yogurt. She will use her increased income to repair her house, which is old and uncomfortable.

She has been in operation for three years and was very timid at first, but over time she developed her personal qualities and now is able to generate good sales.  For this reason, she is very pleased.  M\u00f3nica enjoys talking with her customers and making them laugh.  However, the most difficult part is dealing with low sales due to the strong heat of the sun during the morning hours.  She enjoys having a candy stand because she can sell comfortably and still offer a wide variety of products to her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

They sell \"churchkhela\" in nearby villages. Also, they have a vineyard. They make wine and sell it on the local open market. Total average monthly income of the family is 800 Lari.\r\n\r\nSonia requested a loan to purchase nuts. Thus, she will be able to make more \"churchkhela\". This will increase their sales and the family will get additional income. With increased amount of profit they will be able to reinvest in the family agricultural business to expand it and make it more profitable. Also, with the increased income they plan to repair the house.

She has been separated from her partner for many years.  Roc\u00edo currently lives in her own home, which was built alongside her ex-partner.  There she lives with three of her four children.  Together they strive day after day to improve their standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nRoc\u00edo is a woman who has always worked to get ahead.  She does various jobs in order to generate income, which include doing other people's laundry and selling soft drinks on the weekends.  Occasionally she works with another woman in selling food, but her most frequent business activity is selling clothes.  Roc\u00edo has been in this business for two years.  She started out initially selling only to friends and relatives, but now she sells clothes by going door-to-door.  The articles of clothing are brought in from another city where they can be purchased in bulk.  These products are known for being made from quality materials and for being styled in the latest designs.  What she enjoys most about her work is being able to set her own schedule so that she can devote time to different activities.  At first, the most difficult part for Roc\u00edo was being able to get rid of a large quantity of merchandise but this concern diminished as she began making sales more quickly.  She is eager to continue with her work because she enjoys what she does and hopes to eventually have a clothing store where she can display her merchandise more easily and comfortably.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  Roc\u00edo is grateful for this opportunity and the trust that has been demonstrated to her.  She also promises to complete her payments in a punctual manner.  Roc\u00edo is glad to be part of her Communal Bank since she believes the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  The loan amount of 1,200 PEN that she requested will be invested in the purchase of clothing in different sizes and styles for both sexes.

is 39-year-old Momodu.  He is married and has three children aged 1, 6 and 9. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Momodu established his provisions and drinks business. He started the business to be self-reliant. Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, he earns about 1,400,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL.

She resides in a rural village located in the Sa Ang district of Kampong Cham province. She has seven children, four of whom are dependent on her and only two of them are still in school while the other two are workers. To make a living to support her big family, she and her husband have been planting beans and cucumbers for almost twenty years. \r\n\r\nTouch received her first loan from VisionFund five cycles ago and she completely paid back the loans with VisionFund.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ki, 52, is a married mother of five children, three daughters and two sons. She resides in a rural village of the Tbaung Khmum district of Kampong Cham province, where crop farming is a common way to earn a living. Like other villagers, cassava planting is the main source of her family's income and she has been farming a 3-hectare plot of farmland for almost thirty-two years. \r\n\r\nTo better support their living, her husband runs a ferry boat for fees. The main challenge for her business is the lack of working capital to grow her business.

She is single, and does not yet have children.  She lives in her mother's house along with her 3 siblings.  Each of them shares her goal of improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosalia has a business selling clothing.  Once or twice a month, she travels to the capital city to buy garments at wholesale.  Later, she offers them for sale to her friends, relatives and other people she knows.  She makes her sales on installment credit.  Ever since she started this business 4 years ago, she has worked on her own.  She has seen that this is a very profitable activity because it generates good earnings that help her to cover her personal expenses and those of her family.\r\n\r\nWhat Rosalia likes about her business is that it allows her to have time to devote to her education, and also to do some household chores when needed.  At times she has struggled with making her collections in such a way as to have the money on hand that she needs to renew her inventory of clothing.  However, she has gradually been gaining the respect and trust of her customers, who don't hesitate to make their payments at the agreed time or even sooner.  In the future she wants to have a place where she could set up her own small clothing store.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is very pleased to know that she has financial support, because this way she feels more certain that she will make progress with her work.

is Arlene, 40, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Goldman, an electrician and contractor, and she is the mother of four children. She and her husband and children manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArlene operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArlene hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She and her husband reside in the village earning a living through planting cassava as the main source of the family's income and sometimes they work for others for pay. She has been in this business for several years and she still encounters a lack of working capital to support her business. \r\n\r\nMun successfully paid back her first loan with VisonFund, which has helped her better support her family.  With her current business, she is able to earn 5,500 KHR per day.

She is married to Eddie, a \"tricycle\" driver, and mother to their children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nClarissa operates a bakery. Breads and spreads are staples in the usual Filipino cuisine, and are used mostly for breakfast and snacks. The most popular type of bread is the \"Pandesal\", a Filipino version of the Spanish Pan de Sal or salted bread. It is baked during the wee hours of the morning and sold steaming hot to early commuters, students and workers. Clarissa's store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy raw ingredients like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nClarissa dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She earns about 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Lolita is requesting a loan for 10,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

She lives with her husband and four dependent children, who are still in school, in a rural village of the Tbaung Khmum district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia. To make a living, she has been farming rice on one hectare of farmland and planting cassava on two hectares of farmland for almost twenty-one years, earning around 8,500 KHR per day to spend for daily basic needs. A lack of working capital is still her main challenge in growing her business. \r\n\r\nUn's group consists of three members who are all females and they successfully repaid their loan with VisionFund.

is Angela, 51, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nAngela operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Angela earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Angela hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have a peaceful life and a life close to God.\n\nShe faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

in school. She and her husband are peasants who have been farming maize for eight years to make a living and sometimes they work for others for pay to better support their children. With her current business, she is able to earn around 7,000 KHR per day and she is still in a lack of capital for farming. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Simean's group of three female members who live in the same village.

is Jojit, 38, resident of Bacoor,Cavite city, Philippines. She is married to Jecon, a driver. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJojit maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJojit hopes that her business will continue to be successful. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1116485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She is the mother of 3 children whom she loves very much.  She lives alone in her own house, and she struggles daily to keep going and to have a tranquil life.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling groceries and other basic necessities.  She buys her products at wholesale in bundles, sacks or boxes on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and she later distributes them in her store.  She always provides friendly service with a smile, and offers the best prices to keep her customers.  Her store is set up in a space on her land, and she has been doing this work for about 2 years.  Ever since she started she's not had any problem that has prevented her from continuing.  She used to prepare and sell wood, but because of health reasons she left that line of work and now she feels content for having made this decision.  She now works in greater comfort and feels tranquil because she can generate income for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is the satisfaction that she feels when she sees her returning customers content with having found everything they needed in her store.  Also, this store has given her independence, and most of all, financial solvency to cover the food, health and educational expenses of her family.  She hopes to be able to expand her store, filling it with a greater variety of products so that she can keep the customers that she has managed to attract thus far.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the opportunity and the trust that is being placed in her.

He lives with his wife and son.  He learned farming from his father when he was just a boy.  At that time, working the land was considered more important than going to school.  That's the way it was for don Francisco and he says now that he is just happy to tend his crop.\r\n\r\nHe buys and sells at a local market.  He has to travel a long way by vehicle to go to and from the market and the extra distance to his house is also difficult.  He has to carry the supplies he brings on horseback, not an easy thing for a man his age.    \r\n\r\nDon Francisco is applying to Fundacion Campo for a loan, part of which he will use to buy supplies for his farming business and part to pay rent on the land where he grows his crop.

Now, however, she buys them from people in the countryside and those living in indigenous communities.  She has been in this business for 20 years and works extra hard when the town is celebrating a festival or important event.  Adilia has also been selling used clothing and perfumes for two years on a casual basis.

She is separated from her husband, with whom she has three children, ages 14, 9 and 4. She lives with them in the house she built with her ex-husband. Now she is the owner of a piece of land that someday will be divided in equal parts among her children. For now, she just does her daily best to provide them with everything they need.\r\n\r\nHer work is selling traditional drinks of the region. Each one of her fruit drinks is made with the freshest fruit that she gets at the city's main market. She works 12 hours a day at her stand, located at a corner in her area, that has a lot of commercial activity. To begin with, she used to sell at the door of her home, but later did so all over the city, carrying her fruit drink containers in a cart. But now she has her stand, thanks to  an agreement with the municipal authority of her district, and now sells much more than before. \r\n\r\nShe has worked at this livelihood from a young age, and now has been doing it for 20 years, always working alone. And even though now it is going very well, she acknowledges that at the beginning she had many difficulties, as she didn't know how to prepare the fruit drinks very well. However, now she has become an expert and her delicious drinks are considered the best in her part of the city. She is very happy, because the profitability of this business has allowed her to make many changes and improvements in her living conditions. She really likes what she does. She enjoys talking with her customers and that way knowing their preferences and tastes when it comes to flavors. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, so she is grateful to those who make it possible for her to continue toward her goals. Moreover, she is very committed to once more making her installment payments on time, as she did previously.

She has two adult children who have their own families. She lives alone in her own house, which she was able to get after lots of hard work alongside her husband. Occasionally, her children and grandchildren come to visit; those are the moments at home that fill her with great happiness.\r\n\r\nShe works making clothing. With great patience, she produces the garments that her customers request as well as one-of-a-kind garments that she designs and offers for sale in a small space in her residence. Every style that she creates is sold quickly because of the variety, creativity, and personal touch that she adds to her creations. She has done this work for more than thirty years; she has always worked alone and points out that she has never had any complaints from her customers. \r\n\r\nNow, in the last few months she has branched out into the sale of beer. Both activities allow her to generate her own income and not depend on her children's money. What she likes about her sewing work is that she can express her inspiration in a garment, which makes her feel productive; she hopes to soon construct a much larger workshop with a space set aside especially for the sale of her creations.\r\n\r\nThis is Ana's second loan with MFP, and she appreciates those who make it possible for her to continue toward her objectives. On the other hand, she is very committed to making her punctual loan repayments once a month, like she did last time. She is very happy to belong to her communal bank, since all the members are very good, kind, and supportive.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she has requested (300 PEN), Ana will buy the fabric and thread that she needs to create more garments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1118359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":45.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":49.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":51.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":52.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":55.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.39},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.36,"local_amount":46.46,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":51.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099024,"comment":null},{"amount":18.91,"local_amount":45.39,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401930,"comment":null},{"amount":20.62,"local_amount":49.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":55.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456204,"comment":null},{"amount":21.39,"local_amount":51.34,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":57.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451869,"comment":null},{"amount":21.76,"local_amount":52.22,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447045,"comment":null},{"amount":22.96,"local_amount":55.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":61.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052950,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-18T23:57:22Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438561,"name":"Nancy Violeta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nancy  es  una persona  muy trabajadora  ella  se preocupa   por  el bienestar de su  familia y por  acondicionar  su  vivienda, ella se acerco a la instituci\u00f3n ya  que  desea colocar   piso  de  concreto  afuera de su  casa para que  de esta  manera  no entre  tanto polvo a  su vivienda,  esta  muy  contenta  de habernos  encontrado  ya  que  su   hogar  tendr\u00e1  una  mejor imagen por  lo que  agradece  el  apoyo  para  la realizaci\u00f3n de su proyecto.","en":"Nancy is a hard-working person whose main concern is her family's welfare.

They have 3 hectare of land, where broom is grown. After harvesting, Goichak and her mother-in-law make brooms and sell them on the local open market. In addition to the agricultural business, Goichak is busy with trading. She purchases clothes and shoes at wholesale markets and sells them in nearby villages.

She\u2019s been with her husband, thirty year old Victor, for seven years and they have two children, seven year old Hugo and three year old Virginia.  They live in a home that they own and that she acquired with her husband\u2019s help, after many years of hard work.\r\n\r\nShe sells fast food, primarily broasted chicken.  She does this every day and rises early to go to the market to buy the necessary ingredients and she sells from a window in her home after 5:00 pm.  Sometimes she does it from within her home when it rains.  This has allowed her to maintain loyal customers who know that she will always serve them, any day and in any situation.  She is a very happy and charismatic saleswoman and this is why her customers prefer her; this and because of the delicious seasoning on her dishes.\r\n\r\nShe remembers when she began (five years ago) and only sold a few portions, but with a lot of effort she was able to get more customers and her sales increased.  She also makes extra money selling ice and drinks, which is sometimes difficult for her because she has to move the heavy cases of beer.

They decided to give their group this name because it is the name of the place where they meet up to make their payments.  Each one of these women has a job: Silvia and Mirna sell shoes from a catalog; Gloria sells clothing made of manta (a natural unbleached cotton) and cosmetics; and, lastly, Paulina has a small grocery store.  Their group is located in a sugar-producing region where its people make a living through sowing and cultivating sugarcane.\n\nGloria is 24-years-old, studies in the university, and is single.  Five years ago she decided to start working in her own business since she thought that she would earn more being her own boss.  She sells clothing made of manta (like shirts, skirts, dresses, and cloth napkins), which is typical for the region, that she goes out to buy in the city of Oaxaca.  She also sells cosmetics from a catalog.  Gloria makes her sales by going from house to house to offer her products to customers and acquaintances.  She said, \"sales are good, and when I don't bring a product they place orders and I supply them.  I quite like selling in the streets because I meet many people and I sell a lot.\"  She is happy with her business and with the passage of time has managed to get many customers, which helps her increase her earnings.  \n\nGloria will invest her loan in the purchase of a variety of clothing made of manta (shirts, skirts, dresses, and cloth napkins) and cosmetics in order to continue making sales. She hopes that in the future she will continue making sales, that her business will prosper more, and that she will thus have a better life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":1107762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy natural unbleached cotton clothing and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ACATLAN DE PEREZ, OAXACA.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1503.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1519.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1535.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1552.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1569.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1586.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1603.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1620.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1638.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1655.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1673.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1691.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1709.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1728.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1746.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1765.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1784.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1804.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1823.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.07},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":974.19,"local_amount":13977.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14061.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568695,"comment":null},{"amount":583.28,"local_amount":8368.77,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-02T08:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8419.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399985,"comment":null},{"amount":489.69,"local_amount":7025.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7068.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407643,"comment":null},{"amount":252.84,"local_amount":3627.76,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3649.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120156,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-01T13:11:00Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T17:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":436706,"name":"Meherrem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meherrem is 28 years old, married with two children.

Shuhrat likes to take care of livestock.  He resells livestock at a local market every 5-6 months.  He has set clients, who purchase sheep from him at home.

","en":"Vali is a hardworking man.  He is married and raises three children who are still quite young (the oldest is 6, the second is 3 and the youngest is 1 year old).\r\n\r\nVali and his family have had difficult life circumstances.  In 2000, Vali's father started a private farm on 350 hectares of land.  Within three years of operation they suffered great losses due to difficult weather conditions.  As a result, they had to divide the land among members of the farming business and into nine parts.  Vali's family ended up with 19 hectares of land. \r\n\r\nAs they didn't have the necessary means to plant and harvest, Vali planned a trip to Russia to earn some money.  However, he suddenly fell ill and had to stay in a hospital  for a long time.  Having recovered, he went to Russia, where he worked for two years.  When he came back home with some money, he once again started to get involved in cattle fattening and crop cultivation.  \r\n\r\nHe now mainly grows wheat, corn, peas and other agricultural products and has been involved in this activity for more than three years.  His caring wife and his father help him with the business.  He sells harvested crops directly to the local residents at a much lower price than what can be bought at the market.\r\n\r\nA large number of the residents of this district buy their produce from him.\r\n\r\nVali would like to get a loan to buy seeds, fuel and lubricants.  With the rest of the money, he would also like to purchase livestock to increase his herd.\r\n\r\n

She has been involved in breeding livestock for five years - a business that provides the primary source of income for her family.  Having started this business with a sum of 15,000 som, used to purchase one cow, today Buukan's business already contains four cows.

tiene 50 a\u00f1os, es un hombre responsable y muy trabajador. Vive solo en su casa propia, la misma que pudo obtenerla gracias al esmero que pone d\u00eda a d\u00eda en sus actividades laborales. Actualmente est\u00e1 separado de quien fue su esposa por muchos a\u00f1os, fruto de su matrimonio tiene tres hijos, dos de los cuales ya son mayores de edad y se encarga solo de la menor de ellos, de 17 a\u00f1os. Por ella se esfuerza para poder brindarle lo necesario para sus estudios y para obtener su carrera profesional.\n\nLa principal fuente de ingresos es la construcci\u00f3n, su mano de obra es muy solicitada entre las personas que conocen de su trabajo y lo buscan para contribuir en la edificaci\u00f3n de alg\u00fan proyecto. Su experiencia en esta actividad es su principal carta de presentaci\u00f3n, ya que conoce a detalle todas las pautas necesarias que se exigen en una obra de construcci\u00f3n. Dependiendo de la magnitud puede trabajar solo o acompa\u00f1ado de un grupo de personas que el mismo se encarga de seleccionar, depende tambi\u00e9n de la urgencia que su cliente le exija. En cada uno de los trabajos que ha realizado se esfuerza por dar lo mejor de s\u00ed, buscando en todo momento la tranquilidad y confortabilidad de sus clientes. Lleva desarrollando este oficio hace 15 a\u00f1os y le va muy bien. Por otro lado, eventualmente se dedica a manejar su mocarro haciendo servicio de taxi, y por si fuera poco tambi\u00e9n pretende construir algunas habitaciones en su terreno para alquilarlas, con todo ello busca mejorar su nivel de vida.\nDisfruta mucho de trabajar en la construcci\u00f3n, sabe que con ese trabajo pudo brindar lo necesario a su familia por muchos a\u00f1os; lo complicado es cargar las bolsas pesadas de cemento y manipular las mezclas con sus propias manos, ya que le producen ardor en los dedos y el envejecimiento de la piel. Es por eso que espera trabajar un tiempo m\u00e1s en esta actividad, ahorrar lo suficiente e invertir en el alquiler de habitaciones.\n\nEste es el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 10 con MFP, por tanto agradece a quienes lo hacen posible, para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado, est\u00e1 muy comprometido, una vez m\u00e1s, en cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como lo hizo anteriormente.

Tambi\u00e9n desea comprar madera y calaminas para construir su primera habitaci\u00f3n para alquiler.\n","en":"Enrique is 50 years old.  He is a very hard-working and responsible man.  He lives alone in his own home that he was able to obtain thanks to the care that he puts into his work every day.  Enrique is currently separated from his wife of many years.  As a result of his marriage, he has three children.  Two of his children are already adults and he is only responsible for the youngest (a girl), who is 17 years old.  For this daughter, he works hard so that he can provide her with an education and help her obtain a degree.\r\n\r\nEnrique's main source of income is the construction trade.  His labor is very much in demand among people who know his work and they seek him out to build their projects for them.  His experience in this trade is his main calling card since he knows all the stages of a building job off by heart.  Depending on the scale of a job, he can either work alone or together with a group of people who he selects himself.  This all depends on the urgency expressed by his customers.  On every job that he does, Enrique insists on providing the very best of himself.  He always seeks to make his customers happy and comfortable.  He has been in this business for 15 years and is doing very well.  On a casual basis, he also provides a taxi service.  As if this weren't enough, he has also built some rooms on his land in order to rent them out.  This is all done in order to improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nEnrique really enjoys working in the building trade.  He knows that, through this work, he is able to provide for his family.  His most difficult task is dealing with the heavy bags of cement and manipulating the mixtures with his own hands because it hurts his fingers and ages his skin.  For this reason, he hopes to work just a short while longer in this business before he is able to save up enough to invest in renting out rooms.\r\n\r\nThis is Enrique's 10th loan from MFP and he is grateful to those who are making his loan possible so that he can continue meeting his goals.  He is very committed, once again, to making his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He is very happy to be a member of his community bank because all of the members are very good, kind, supportive people.\r\n\r\nEnrique would like to use the 500 soles he has requested to replace some of his tools so that he can improve his work.  He would also like to buy wood and metal sheets so that he can build his first room to rent out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1118376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"to renew some of his work tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-06-18T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-18T23:10:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":75.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":85.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":77.5,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":82.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099025,"comment":null},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":75.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":81.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401933,"comment":null},{"amount":33.01,"local_amount":82.54,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":88.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456207,"comment":null},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":85.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451872,"comment":null},{"amount":34.85,"local_amount":87.12,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447048,"comment":null},{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":91.53,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":98.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052953,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-19T19:07:55Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":438570,"name":"Cecilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Cecilio se dedica a la venta de electrodom\u00e9sticos, y es gracias a su trabajo que pudo juntar un dinero y hoy quiere abrir una tienda de comestibles y venta de bebidas de todo tipo.

She is requesting her first Kiva loan in order to buy a hairdresser\u2019s chair, a dressing table and a cabinet to offer better service to her customers. \r\n\r\nLedis has always been attracted by anything related to beauty. For this reason she decided to take a course in hairdressing four years ago where she learned much about the profession. Once she finished, she started doing hair at people\u2019s homes and gradually became known and acquired customers. However Ledis wanted to have a fixed location where she would have all the equipment needed to provide her services.  Thus she applied for a loan with a financial institution and with it bought the basics needed to start her business at home. Her customers are her neighbors in the area, although she will still go out to someone\u2019s home when it is required. \r\n\r\nLedis pays cash weekly for the materials that she uses and buys from distributors in the city center. Her principal dream is to have a large place, well supplied with all the equipment needed, separate from her home.\r\n\r\nShe lives in a common law relationship and has three minor children. She wants to see them educated and grow up under the best conditions. That is why she does her best for her customers, so that she can increase her sales and earn more

His partner of 30 years is Nancy, who is 45 years old.  Eliu owns his house, which he and his partner built with much effort and intense work days.  They live with their youngest daughter (they have four children in all) who is 18 and is hard at work studying for her professional career.\r\n\r\nEliu makes a living selling groceries, vegetables, and other basic necessities.  He has a small grocery store that he has set up in his home.  He and his partner work every day attending to customers who come to purchase the products they need for food preparation.  Eliu\u2019s store is open from five in the morning, and he treats each of his customers with great respect.  \r\n\r\nEliu has had this business for about 5 years, and was able to make economic progress during that time; however, he felt that this wasn\u2019t enough, since the income he earned from sales wasn\u2019t sufficient to provide his family with a decent life.  That is why Eliu started working part-time providing a security service on the streets of the city, and he receives a monthly salary for that work.  The bad thing about that job is that he has to stay awake for long hours, but that is more than compensated by his neighbors, who show him how much they appreciate and respect him for making them feel protected. \r\n\r\nWhen Eliu started out with his store he had many difficulties, since he allowed his neighbors to pay on credit, and then they either didn\u2019t pay him on time or else didn\u2019t pay him the full amount of their debt.  Over time the situation has improved, and Eliu has learned from his experiences.\r\n\r\nThis is Eliu\u2019s sixth loan with MFP, and he appreciates this opportunity and the confidence that has been placed in him.  He promises to make all of his payments on time.  He is grateful to be part of his communal bank, since he has seen that the other members are responsible and supportive individuals.

She lives in the company of people that she rents some rooms to. \r\n\r\nHer main livelihood is selling dried \"hirapay\" leaves (hirapay is an Amazonian palm), that are used for roofing of houses. She stores them in her home and sells them on an area of sidewalk by the highway. \r\n\r\nShe started more than six months ago with a private loan, and so far has had the help of her children and of a person she pays on a weekly basis. She considers her business to be quite profitable because of the earnings it provides her. \r\n\r\nMoreover she says that she decided to start this business through her business partner's idea. He is the one who looks after harvesting these leaves in the distant forests. Now, seeing the results, she plans to continue, and to increase her investment.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with the MFP institution, so she promises to once more meet her installment payments, as in previous loans she has had. In addition, she feels at ease with her communal bank, as she considers it a close-knit and supportive group.\r\n\r\nThe entire amount of 1000 nuevos soles applied will be used to harvest hirapay leaves. She is seeking to minimize expenses and get the largest quantity possible, so that she can have greater

Two years ago when she separated from the father of her children she saw the necessity of looking for a source of income that would insure the wellbeing of herself and her family. Then she found an opportunity to sell cheese from the town of Pivijay in the department of Magdalena, her birthplace. Each time she traveled to make purchases, she observed that there was a potential market for selling a different product that would generate additional income beyond the costs incurred. She then got the idea to sell on credit hand crafted custom sandals made by her brother.\r\n\r\nWith her first Kiva loan, Emis aims to increase her sales not only by buying a larger number of sandals to sell but  she wants to buy a sewing machine motor to repair one she owns and give it to her brother so that he can increase production and expand capacity.  This is a family business in that various members each contribute a little to the business and work arduously so that it grows in space as well as in infrastructure, equipped with good machines, and becomes widely recognized.\r\n\r\nEmis lives with her minor children, aged 16 and 13, for whom she longs to provide a better future, especially with respect to their living conditions because the place where she currently lives is not the best.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1118721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase women's sandals to sell as well as a motor to repair a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-06-19T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-07-19T04:30:03Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emis Arelis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":72748},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78528},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80361},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82236},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84155},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88128},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90184},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":92288},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94442},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96645},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":104167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":72748,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":74161.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338910,"comment":null},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":78528,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80053.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395461,"comment":null},{"amount":45.92,"local_amount":80361,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81922.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775250,"comment":null},{"amount":47,"local_amount":82236,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":83833.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387246,"comment":null},{"amount":103.35,"local_amount":180864,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":184377.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994083,"comment":null},{"amount":44.31,"local_amount":77537,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":79043.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071155,"comment":null},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":182472,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":186017.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527213,"comment":null},{"amount":53.97,"local_amount":94442,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":96276.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372927991,"comment":null},{"amount":114.74,"local_amount":200812,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":204713.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705197,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T22:43:50Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":439199,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is a fifty-seven-year-old married man with seven children.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSusan operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSusan dreams to be able to expand her business. She hopes to be financially free one day.

She is a widow; since the death of her husband, she has been raising 3 children alone. With limited career options because of cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Naghada is one of the many Iraqi woman who work from home, using her sewing skills to generate some additional income to meet the financial needs of herself and her children. \r\n\r\nShe has 6 years' experience with her sewing and tailoring. Trying to improve her work and opportunities, she would like to buy a small generator, an over machine, an iron stand, and some fabric. The generator will allow her to work even during the hours the power is off - which happens frequently in her city - while the other items will help her offer a better variety of services for her customers.\r\n\r\nIn order to make these purchases, Naghada took a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Comparte su d\u00eda a d\u00eda junto a ellos, en su casa propia, entrega todo su esfuerzo para brindarles una mejor calidad de vida.\n\nSu trabajo consiste en la venta de pescado fresco o salado. Esta labor la realiza personalmente, de manera diaria o semanal, en los principales mercados de la ciudad. La cantidad de pescado y la frecuencia con que los pone a la venta depende estrictamente de los resultados de la jornada de pesca que realiza en los r\u00edos de la ciudad. Realiza este trabajo con la ayuda y colaboraci\u00f3n de sus hermanos, ellos se encargan de pescar las especies que tienen mayor demanda y mejor tama\u00f1o, respetando siempre las \u00e9pocas de veda. Lleva en este negocio muchos a\u00f1os y los ingresos econ\u00f3micos que le produce son muy beneficiosos, ya que en muchas oportunidades ha logrado triplicar su inversi\u00f3n inicial.

She works daily or weekly at the main markets in the city.  The quantity of fish and frequency of sale depends strictly on the daily fishing activity in the city rivers.  Her brothers help out by collaborating and fishing the species that are in highest demand and the best size, always respecting the fishing season.  She has been in business for many years and the income is very advantageous, since sometimes she triples the initial investment.  When she goes out to sell fish sometimes she takes clothing to sell in the villages on the riverbanks, which is an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nShe likes what she does because she is in contact with nature, enjoying the beauty of the rivers, spending time doing what she does best and contributing to species preservation.  That is why she does not like seeing other fisherman who only want to get rich, contaminating the rivers and capturing small sized, illegal species.  Her goal is to have a permanent stall at the village market.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and she is grateful for the opportunity and trust placed in her.  She is also committed to paying the loan back on time.

She is a married Iraqi woman and a mother of two children. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Shna is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Shna qualified for a home improvement loan, which she successfully repaid to Relief International - Microfinance Iraq. She is now taking advantage of a business loan to improve her sewing\/tailoring activities. \r\n\r\nShe has eight years experience in meeting the needs of her customers, making dresses and other fabric household items. With the loan, she plans to improve both her work conditions and the services she is offering. She would like to purchase a small generator to be able to work at the frequent times when the power is out. She would also like to purchase an A\/C unit, some small furniture items for her work area and an iron.  \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual. As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of three to five clients and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

Nanuli and her daughters-in-law are involved in the family's agricultural business. They have three milking cows and produce cheese. Part of the cheese is used by the family and the other part is sold on the local open market. Also, they have a plot of land where 350 nut trees are grown. The total average monthly income of the family is 850 GEL.\r\n\r\nNanuli requested a loan for cultivating her agricultural land. After cultivation, she plans to sow maize there. The family will work hard during spring and summer seasons and after the seasonal works are properly done, they hope to get good harvest. This will enable them to decrease dairy costs as they will make hay from the mowed grass to feed the cattle instead of buying it at a high price. Due to the above mentioned, the family will be able to get more milk and increase cheese production. As a result of this Kiva loan, the family\u2019s income will increase, which will enable them to improve the family\u2019s living conditions.

Seeking an additional source of income for her family back in 2000, Kaliya set up her business of producing national handmade felt carpets (shyrdak) with 5,000 som (KGS). Having created their own group and set up the production by means of joint efforts in material purchasing and work from home, the Group's monthly income from the sale of their products amounts to nearly 20,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Kaliya turned to the organization Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase necessary carpet fibers and materials. Kaliya and the Group are planning on investing the earnings from the loan into the further business expansion and purchase a sewing machine to make Kyrgyz national hats
