Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":54.17,"image":{"id":1460155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grocery goods for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2013-11-03T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-02T02:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Champa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2664.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429613964,"comment":null},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2664.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439840426,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-03T06:21:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625790,"name":"Mira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mira is 35 years old.

She states that she enjoys farming very much but access to dairy feed is her biggest challenge.\r\n\r\nPriscilla chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because of the low interest it gives on their loans and the loan repayment has been made easier to clients.

","en":"Mastura was born in 1984. Since childhood she dreamed of becoming happy and have many children. However, life turned out differently. She lost her husband. He died a tragic death. Mastura raises her only child alone. \r\n\r\nMastura has worked with selling fabric for more than 9 years. She purchases wholesale at the central market and sells at the local market. Mastura has her own sales point at the local market. She would like to renew her goods for the new late fall season. She requests a loan in the amount of 3,000 US dollar to purchase fabric for the new season. She will provide good living conditions for her child with the income received. She awaits your kindness and hopes for your

is a young farmer from Goris city in the Syuniq region. He lives with his parents. Sarmen's mother works in the private sector. To take care of his family, Sarmen is engaged in beekeeping. His father helps him in his everyday activities related to beekeeping. Sarmen sells the honey in the local market, which is an important source of income for the family. Honey is a product in very high demand, particularly if it comes from the family's area. \r\n\r\nTo continue beekeeping in a sustainable way, Sarmen needs to make some investments in it. He needs a loan of $3,000 to purchase twenty beehives and to pay for the renovation and transportation of the beehives. He has taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to repay it. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Sarmen has been able to run his agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that he will be able to cover the monthly payments. \r\n\r\nHe has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.

The pleasant smell of pine perfumes the air.  This  is  the  setting  where  eight  women  united  to  form  a  Friendship  Bridge  Trust  Bank  called  \u201cFemenil\u201d  meaning  \u201cfemale\u201d. Most of the women are 29 years old, and each has a tremendous desire to excel in order to support their families and their community. They are eager  to  begin their third  loan cycle,  which will be funded by KIVA investors,  with  Friendship  Bridge.  The amount requested will be used in their businesses which range from animal husbandry, small stores for daily consumption, textile production, and the creation of beautiful, embroidered handmade items. \r\n\r\nPetronila is one of the younger members of the Trust Bank.  She is 19 years of age and has two children.  Because  of  the  scarcity  of  financial  resources,  she  was  unable  to  continue her  education past the third grade.  Like  the  other  members  of  her  Trust  Bank,  she  knows  that  education is a vital key to a successful future and looks forward to watching  her children attend  school  in  the future.  Petronila raises animals and also owns a small store for daily consumption items. She needs more items on the shelves of her store. She approached Friendship Bridge for a new loan of $615 which she will use to buy more sugar, rice, noodles, pasta, bread, oil, and water.  In addition, she will purchase feed for the eleven turkeys that she is raising. She is most grateful to be a member of the \u201cFemenil\u201d Trust Bank for the working capital that is as necessary for her success as a business woman.  \r\n\r\nThe women of the Trust Bank meet once each month with a Loan Officer or \u201cFacilitadora\u201d from Friendship Bridge.  They   not   only  make  payments  on  their  loans  but  also  receive  valuable  trainings  on  subjects  like  women\u2019s and  children\u2019s health and  nutrition, family planning,  money  management and  savings,  women\u2019s  rights  and  self  esteem.  The ladies send many blessings to KIVA investors and gratitude for funding their loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875.3,"image":{"id":1459769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sugar, oil, pasta, rice, and more inventory for her store  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chichicastenango, Departamento El Quiche","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T00:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T00:20:01Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastasia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacinta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":34800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3481.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3469.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.66},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":436.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.65,"local_amount":3481.2,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503439,"comment":null},{"amount":437.65,"local_amount":3481.2,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3488.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728423,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T09:30:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626191,"name":"Ama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Although she has received no prior formal education, Ama is an entrepreneur.

away, and it was very difficult for her to cope with her family expenses because she wasn't making enough money.  She is 44 years old and the breadwinner for two children.  She is a light in the lives of these children and is their only hope.  Kumriniso has a degree in teaching and has worked for more than 26 years in high schools.  She has made a large contribution to education in Tajikistan - Kumriniso has taught many students, and her students work in a variety of fields.  Kumriniso plans to build a house for her children because of the poor state of her current home.  She is trying to make it possible for her children to grow up in good living conditions.  She is asking for a loan of 5000 TJS to purchase building materials like cement, wood, bricks, etc. to build her home.  She awaits your kindness and hopes for your charity.  Kumriniso is a good person.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.42,"image":{"id":1461252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy building materials such as wood, bricks, and cement to build a house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kurgantyube","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumriniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":345.34},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":356.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":372.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":372.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":415.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":422.28},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":430.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":451.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":462.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":493.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.03},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":147.42,"local_amount":702.08,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":703.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989676,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T03:31:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626262,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma is 57 years old, married, and has five children, one of whom is in school.

years old, married, and, together with her husband, is raising 6 children.  Makhbuba has a higher education.  Makhbuba's work in animal husbandry, beginning 13 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Makhbuba's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, 1 horse, and 0.98 hectares of land, on which she grows corn and sunflowers every year.  Makhbuba's monthly income is 20,000 KGS.  With the goal of continuing to grow her herd, Makhbuba turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase cows to fatten and resell.  Makhbuba plans to use profit from the loan to continue to increase the number of domestic livestock in her care, and also plans to save money to repair her house.

Fayziniso works in livestock, and, with the help of her father-in-law, has been raising cattle to sell for 4 years.  Fayziniso's parents taught her how to care for and feed cows, and before getting married, Fayziniso worked with her parents in a barnyard.  Now, however, Fayziniso can work in livestock on her own.

Alina has a high school education.  Alina's work in animal husbandry and farming, beginning 8 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 20,000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Alina's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, 1 horse, 20 sheep, and 1.6 hectares of land, on which she grows beans every year.  Her monthly income is 5,000 KGS.  With the goal of further increasing her herd, Alina turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 50,000 KGS to purchase sheep.  Alina plans to use profit from the loan to continue to increase the number of domestic animals in her care, and to save money to build a new house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1461285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bakai-Ata","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":735}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T18:05:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626265,"name":"Kika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kika is a 42-year-old married woman with 12 children.

Naychabubu has a high school education.  Naychabubu's work in animal husbandry and farming, beginning 31 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 8000 KGS, has been the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to Naychabubu's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows and 2.43 hectares of land, on which she grows beans, cabbage, and clover every year.  Her monthly income is 9000 KGS.  With the goal of further developing her farm, Naychabubu turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 80,000 KGS to purchase cows for cattle breeding.  Naychabubu plans to use profit from the loan to continue to increase the number of domestic animals in her care, and also plans to save money to pay for her son's wedding celebration."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.75,"image":{"id":1461292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"May village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T01:20:03Z","loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naychabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3100},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3400},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3700},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3700},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3900},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":22800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.19},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.44},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.88,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3004.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427140,"comment":null},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3004.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942687,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T03:31:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626273,"name":"Losivale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Losivale is  46 years old and married, with six children. \r\n\r\nShe has a small plantation where she grows taro, yams, and bananas to earn a living.

He helped his family members do diverse jobs like finishing garments and putting on the finishing touches, among others.  This experience allowed him to get three machines in order to start his own shop.  In his shop he provides sewing services to third parties.  He makes sports uniforms for four educational entities in his area.\r\n\r\nFor some time he alternated his work with his studies because he was finishing his high school education.  Nowadays he works full time in his shop.  He also has help from two direct employees.  This way he has generated enough financial resources to contribute to his household\u2019s finances.\r\n\r\nHis energy, positive attitude, drive, and the dedication with which he does his work have allowed him to fulfill the objectives that he sets for himself.  That is why he is motivated to request the loan to buy supplies wholesale (fabric, thread, elastic, and buttons, among others).  He will also perform maintenance on his machines.  This will allow him to have the raw material to make the garments and to be able to finish his orders in a timely fashion.  He will also be able to streamline the production with renovated machinery, which will allow him to get products with excellent finishing and satisfy his customers\u2019 needs.  \r\n\r\nAll of this will produce, as a result, an increase in the income that he gets in order to continue supporting his family.  Santiago wishes to continue his work.  He wants to firmly establish and strengthen his shop even more in order to fulfill his dream of expanding it and generating more opportunities for direct employment.  This will benefit not only his family, but it will benefit other people who have an effect on this hard work.  To him, this means having a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":70.34,"image":{"id":1463135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy supplies wholesale (fabric, thread, elastic, and buttons, among others) and to perform maintenance on his machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T02:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T02:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65415},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67226},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69087},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70999},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72964},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74984},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77059},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79192},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81384},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83637},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85952},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88331},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90776},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93289},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95871},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98525},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101252},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104057}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.85},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.99},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.41},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":65416,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":65746.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074812,"comment":null},{"amount":35.45,"local_amount":66470,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":66806.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440010010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-28T14:51:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626300,"name":"Salote","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salote is a 45-year-old married woman with 5 children.

She has a specialized-secondary education and is involved in animal husbandry, an activity which provides her family with its main source of income. She started in this business 16 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Elmira's hard work, her farming business now comprises two dairy cows and ten sheep.

She wishes to open a savings account with AMB when she makes a good profit and becomes well-known in the market.   \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":48.7,"image":{"id":1461076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy incense, cosmetic materials and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"hodeidah","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2013-11-04T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-03T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awsh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sameera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":10252},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":9972},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":9972}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.7,"local_amount":10252,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10475.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439632116,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-19T00:24:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":626371,"name":"Halima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima is married and has one child, who attends school.
