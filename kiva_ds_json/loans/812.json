She began her business because just after she concluded her national primary school education, she lost her father and by then her mother was seriously sick so that she could neither look after her nor support her education. So therefore, she decided to assist neighbors in doing business with the intention that somebody would take care of her schooling, but unfortunately, that did not happen.\r\n\r\nSo she finally made up her mind to continue business and started to raise funds and started her own business. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,500,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000. Memuna requires a loan in order to buy 10 cartons of ladies' slippers @ SLL 250,000 and five dozen ladies' trousers @ SLL 420,000. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 900,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Memuna plans to rent a shop at the center of town and also hopes to see her children educated to higher levels.

is 34 year-old Mariatu. She is single and has no children but she does have two dependents who live with her because she is assisting the family for their schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Mariatu established her textiles business. She began her business because, after the death of her mother there was no other person to take over her mother\u2019s business. She had wanted to further her education after acquiring a diploma in business studies, but she just decided to implement what she had studied by taking over the business. \r\n\r\nWith her experience, the business has improved gradually. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,200,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000 in order to buy 50 yards of lace @ Le 30,000, 10 bolts of printed cloth @ SLL 80,000 and 20 yards material @ SLL 25,000.

She is an incredible woman: hardworking, dedicated, and above all, charismatic.

","en":"Gumercinda lives with her 22 year old daughter in the town of Soledad; she makes and sells mats and industrial cleaning rags that she makes out of fabric remnants that she buys from clothing manufacturers in downtown Barranquilla 20 minutes away from her town. \r\n\r\nShe has the entire process installed at home and she works it alone.  She assembles them and sells them mainly to local retailers who are her main market.  She\u2019s done very well with her business but her working capital is insufficient to expand in her market, increase sales and respond to her great challenge which is competition; this is what Gumercinda wants to accomplish and the reason behind her Kiva loan request, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy fabric remnants in larger amounts.  She will thus qualify for volume discounts which she will most assuredly pass on to operational costs and will increase supply and number of customers which is precisely where she justifies her investment\u2019s success.\r\n

She is married and raising three children.  Anarkul was born in 1955 into a simple family with many children.  Her father was a paramedic, and mother was a seamstress.  Being the oldest in the family, Anarkul helped her parents with the household since childhood and took care of her six brothers and sisters.  She graduated from the Orlovskaya secondary school in her native village and followed her father's footsteps by going to a medical college in Bishkek after school.  In 1975, after finishing college, she got a job as a nurse at the Sokulukskaya district hospital.  This same year, Anarkul got married and gave birth to a daughter and son.  In 1978, Anarkul and her husband moved to the Alekseevka village (Jayl district, Chuyskaya region), where they bought a plot of land.  Anarkul got a job as a paramedic at the Alekseevka paramedic-ambulatory site, and her husband got a job as a leading specialist at the Jayl district prosecutor's office.  In 1980, Anarkul got a job as a teacher at the Karabalta medical college, and gave birth to her youngest daughter in 1986.  During the years of perestroika, Anarkul and her husband started to build a large house.  Because the money lost its value, their salaries were not enough to cover even regular food.  This is why Anarkul had to go a market, where she resold fruits and vegetables.  Thanks to their hard work, persistence and mutual support, Anarkul and her husband built a good, large house, raised and educated their children.  In 2002, Anarkul received a title of \"Excellent Healthcare Professional.\"\r\n\r\nCurrently, Anarkul works as a teacher at the Karablta medical college and is also involved in animal husbandry.  Having started this business with an amount of 30,000 som, Anarkul was able to grow her business to have a monthly profit of 15,000 som.  At the present time, her business has one heifer and ten sheep.  In order to further develop her business, Anarkul requested a loan in the amount of 135,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy five heads of bulls.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":1040738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

The city is known for having a warm climate and beautiful beaches.  It is mostly known because the population has a talent for good seasoning when preparing dishes.  One of his favorite dishes is the delicious \u201cArroz con pato\u201d (rice with duck).  Therefore, his favorite pastime is cooking.  He also likes to listen to music.  He is currently studying gastronomy.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of effort and dedication Luis managed to have his own business selling baby clothes.  He works around ten hours a day, and he tends to about 25 customers a day.  He really likes his business because he feels a special joy when parents come to buy clothes for their babies.  It is so tender to see how this joy and this emotion is valued and how the babies look once they use his products.  He believes that his business is going well for him because he is kind, and, above all, he has patience with the customers.  He also offers quality products.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful to the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to your help he will be able to buy seasonal merchandise, which is to say baby clothes for the winter.  He will have a greater variety of products, which will satisfy his customers.  His income will improve in order to continue his daily struggle to achieve his big dream:  To grow in his business and to be able to offer other types of products.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1028057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has a retail business.  At her sales location she displays merchandise like accessories, stationery, and various items.  When she started as a merchant 20 years ago she did so by selling beer.\r\n\t\r\nDue to health problems she later changed her business and started to sell all types of merchandise.  It was a small and very domestic market that gave her orders that she needed to fill.  However, little by little she was setting up a sales location in her own house.  She did so in order to sell items like pencils, cardboard, paper, women\u2019s accessories, and cologne, etc. that the neighbors need all of the time.  The business has gone very well for her.  She has managed to get her children ahead and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the 21st loan she has with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This organization has supported her growth.  Through their loans she went from selling through a customer distribution system to having a general store or sales location where she can offer items that are greatly needed by children, adolescents, and adults.\r\n\r\nHer dream for growing is to have more prosperity than she currently has, to increase her inventory, and to have more customers.  This is the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan.  She will use it to buy a display case and merchandise to stock her business.  She will update her inventory and include stationery, which she does not now have.\r\n\r\nMartha\u2019s experience is her greatest ally.

She started the business 10 years ago when she was offered to rent a store front, and she accepted. Her business is important because it pays the bills, like electric, gas and water services. She enjoys when customers purchase her products and she feels proud of having a store where someone can come when they need something or when there's an emergency.

She hopes that it gets better, because she would like to set up the club somewhere else and therefore expand the business. She will use the loan to purchase more Herbalife products for her club, such as shakes and tea of various flavors. She hopes that her business works out well and that she can do what she would very much like to do, which is to improve her business a little.\r\nLilia is a member of the \"Las Chaparritas\" communal bank, which is comprised of 11 hardworking ladies. All of them run businesses and they will be mentioned as follows: Adela, Jovita, Rosa, Andrea Guadalupe, Gloria, Yesenia, Bertha, Amelia, Josefina, Ma de Jes\u00fas.

He has good personal and professional references. He lives in his own home with his family in Morrop\u00f3n, about four hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the department of Lambayeque. The community is small and the people are very friendly to visitors. Alejandro has made a living in farming and raising and selling small animals for the past five years. He wants to invest in his business. Specifically, he wants to purchase corn, to fix his corrals and to maintain his bean crops. In this way he can increase his profits, provide for his family and improve their quality of life. This is why he is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa.

When she has sufficient orders, she buys the items, delivers them to her customers and collects the payments. She enjoys her business very much, since she runs it in her spare time and does not neglect her small children. Isaura needs this loan to invest in buying a variety of plates, glasses, pans and utensils to stock her business.

Each one works in their own business.      \r\n\r\nThe group member who we interviewed is named Villamar. He is single and lives in a small town where they celebrate the festival of the Saint Anthony of the Mountain. He requested a loan to invest in the purchase of fruits, like bananas. He has been working in this type of business for 5 years and 5 months. He commented that the business is doing well, that everyday he improves his income in his business and his home. He started this business so that he could have his own income. In this way he is able to contribute to the household expenses, so that they don't lack the necessities. The thing he hopes for most is that with the loan and his profits he will be able to increase his savings to be able to buy a bigger car, which he will use to continue working with his brother. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group include Blanca Araceli who will invest her part of the loan in purchasing Avon brand cosmetics; Santa who will invest in buying merchandise to stock her grocery store and Maria del Rosario who will invest in buying pigs to re-sell. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1020136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Araceli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Villamar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044544,"comment":null},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656742,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317414,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418799,"comment":null},{"amount":279.16,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568401,"comment":null},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3541.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399768,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-23T03:12:46Z","paid_date":"2012-09-16T08:06:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403522,"name":"Winefreda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Forty-nine-year-old Winefreda is a hog-raiser from San Miguel, Bohol.

They all make a living with their own business. All of the group members are from a small town called Jamiltepec, a pretty place where there is a beautiful river with green trees. The river is called 'Rio Verde' [Green River]\r\n\r\nOne of the group members is Maria Isabel, a hard working woman of 41 years old. Maria Isabel, who is better known as Chabela, makes a living selling chickens. She has had this business for 18 years. Chabela is happily married to Brigido, who is 43 years old and with whom she has 4 children: Adrian, Gonzalo, Ruben and Lu\u00eds. Their children are their motivation to work because they want to give them a better life and a better education. Chabela told us that she started to sell house to house, buying a small amount of chickens to sell, but with the help of the foundation she bought more chickens. In the mornings she goes out to sell in the streets of the community.

She is 35, and married to Domingo. They have three children, and all three are going to school; one is in first year of high school, another in second year of junior high school, and the youngest is in fourth year of primary school.   \r\n\r\nShe makes and sells bread, empanadas, and rolls, and has been doing this for two years.  She says she decided to start this business, because from a very young age, her mother taught her to make these products. She wanted to put into practice everything she learned. Apart from this, it is a very good source of income, and provides good earnings; it enablies her to secure her children's education and future. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she received, she intends to purchase more ingredients such as flour, eggs, salt, sugar, yeast, milk, rice, cinnamon, bananas, cooking oil, etc. Soco's goal, (that is how she is known in the community) is to make her business grow, as she thinking about building a small shop to set up a bakery in; and also to buy more cooking utensils that she needs. \r\n\r\nThis way she will earn more and better income, enabling her to continue supporting her children with their studies, so that they will have good professions.

There on the warm shore and constant breeze she has her store named after what she feels there - Brisas [breezes] - which are a result of the famous trade winds. She's been running her business since she arrived in this area from Pinchote in the state of Santander; she came seeking better horizons and originally relocated with her family to the city of Santa Marta, where they worked in a store. Ultimately, they wound up in Barranquilla doing the same work, but there they made it a liquor store. With their profits they had an opportunity to buy a store and retrofit it so they could live there with their two children, who are now 19 and 23 years old. Rosario is happy to live in Puerto Colombia because she likes the ways of the coastal people - uncomplicated and happy - but she hasn't forgotten the lush, mountainous countrysides of her homeland. Her goal is to increase her business until she can make it self-service, but she doesn't have enough capital to make her dream a reality. For that reason she is accessing a Kiva loan, her first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundaiton. She will use it to buy provisions to increase her inventory and have a greater variety of products. The experience and work ethic of this Santander native will be the keys to the success of this investment.

She lives alone with her husband and children in the town of Koutiala. Tintina did not go to school; she was a victim of the time when girls did not have the right to go to school, and for this reason she became interested in the business which she learnt from her mother. She has been carrying out this business for more than ten years now and has a good reputation, because \"sounbala\" (a condiment made from pounding and fermenting \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts) is one of the most popular condiments with women, and thus she can make good money from this business. \r\n\r\nIn order to grow her business, Tintina joined the microfinance institution, Soro,Yiriwaso, six years ago. She has participated in six group loans (solidarity loans) which have all been repaid in full, and she is now on her fifth individual loan, the previous four having also been repaid in full. With this loan, she is planning to buy 10 sacks of \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts from stockists in Koutiala and these will be made up into \"sounbala\" and sold on a retail and wholesale basis and for cash in Bamako and Kayes to a customer base made up of women, \r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 120,000FCFA, which she is planning to use to repay interest to Soro and to contribute to improving her family's living conditions.  In this context, Tintina is planning to expand her business in the future.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1044055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy  \"n\u00e9r\u00e9\" nuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tintina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-22T08:25:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251944,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449072,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268461,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102918,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100700.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624773,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-17T17:54:29Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":403608,"name":"Malkia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tea, who is in her early 20s, is married.

She currently works at home, and she has a good reputation because she receives many orders for mats, scarves, and baby clothes each month.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that her customers are well satisfied, Miriam did not hesitate in deciding to join the institution, Soro Yiriwaso, four years ago. After five solidarity loans (group loans) and two individual loans that were all correctly repaid, she is now on her third loan.\r\n\r\nShe stocks up in Koutiala and plans to buy three boxes of wool from retail sellers. She sells her wares for cash or credit in the city of Koutiala to a customer base made up of women.

Previously she quit her job at a local manufacturing factory in order to care for her two young ones. For this reason she wants to start a business, buying two sewing machines and raw materials for making curtains and bath sets. She works from home, cares for her kids, and sells locally to add a little income to her small monthly child support of 80,000 colones ($156 dollars a month) in order to pay for a place to live and for her family\u2019s food. \r\n\r\nShe begins her day at 6:00 in the morning, getting her 6 year old daughter ready to go to school. She comes back and does the housework. She picks her daughter up at 10:30 am, and during that time she has her little son. She gets lunch ready since, with two children in the house, she begins her work in the afternoon, and she plans to work, depending on orders, until 9:30 pm. \r\n\r\nWith this money she hopes to pay household expenses, developing herself as an entrepreneur and a mother. She wants a better life for her family so that they can live well, and most importantly, so that she can be close to her children during the day. Right now she\u2019s having money problems which is the reason the family (her father and mother) have prompted her to develop of this business and get ahead financially. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1030288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy two sewing machines to make curtains and bath sets.

The boy attends secondary school and the girl upper secondary school. Dolores sells wafers. She applies for this loan to buy flour, bags, paint, oil and ribbons to produce the wafers. She launched her business four years ago. She learned her activity when she was working for a woman who produced wafers. Later her husband applied for a loan to buy ingredients in order to start the business. This activity is important for Dolores, because it gives her the needed financial means to pay for food and tuition fees for her children.\r\n\r\nDolores is proud to provide for herself. Thanks to this well-managed business she was able to put a roof on her house and build her workshop. In her community many people produce wafers. She uses her profit to buy what is lacking at home and save some money with the idea of buying another machine to produce wafers. She dreams and hopes that she can keep on working until her children complete their education, get a job and can provide for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group want to thank Kiva and the microfinance institution Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for their help, and ask them to continue their financial support so that the group members can keep on working in their businesses and enjoy a better life with their families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5125,"image":{"id":1020292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, bags, paint, oil and ribbons to produce wafers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Amilcingo, Temoac, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-16T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":173,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio Humberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodemaribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sheyla Berta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Imelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Jhanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4062.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":320.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2242.19,"local_amount":28437.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":28443.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044547,"comment":null},{"amount":1281.25,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":16253.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656745,"comment":null},{"amount":1601.56,"local_amount":20312.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20316.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317417,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-20T03:38:52Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T17:17:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":402050,"name":"Nidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nidia  de 49 a\u00f1os de edad es la propietaria de un estadero que incluye tienda de ranchos y v\u00edveres.

This would avoid the expense for transportation.\r\n\r\nShe is now applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy snacks, foodstuffs, drinks, and liquor in greater volume.  This way she will be getting provisions for the holidays and increasing the inventory in her store.  The success of this investment stems from the fact that she gets discounts for buying in volume.

She and her husband work together and put a lot of effort into their work.\r\n\r\nNicolaza is a very hard-working person who has been gaining knowledge in the field of agriculture since she was very young.  Over time she managed to save up some money which she planned to use to buy a plot of land in the city so that she could leave it to her children as an inheritance.  However, she was ripped off because after having paid for the lot on which to build, the sellers disappeared.  Nicolaza was disillusioned but the distraction of her work gradually allowed her to get over the con trick.  Nicolaza's pineapple production is increasing and now she and her husband have periods of prosperity and they both feel happy together caring for their only son.  \r\n\r\nNicolaza is requesting a loan to induce (chemically mature) her pineapples so that she can achieve her first harvest and thereby recoup her lost money and increase her production.  She will use the loan that she has requested to bring forward her harvest and get her farm ready for future crops.  When she heard about Kiva loans she was keen and agreed to provide the information and commitment that is

","en":"Kulsara is 55 years old. She has brought up four children. In the search of an income source for her family, in 1993 Kulstara started a farming and livestock business. Her business, launched with 10,000 KGS of starting capital, now brings in about 8,000 KGS monthly from the sales of milk and dairy products. Thanks to Kulsara's hard work, her livestock now includes two dairy cows, one calf and 35 sheep. In addition, Kulsara works 1.6 ha [about 4 acres] of land, where she grows kidney beans. In order to develop her business further, Kulsara turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS intended for buying livestock. Kulsara plans to use her revenues for increasing her livestock further.

In spring his sons run the animals into the mountains each morning to find pasture, so that they return in the evening well fed. Now he keeps the livestock at his house. Rahimkul bought a few kilograms of oilcake and hay to feed the livestock in winter. To improve his quality of life and raise his children well Rahimkul also works in construction and does home repairs. He was happy to find out that organizations like Arvand exist that can financially support and carry out his plan.

to change their families' lives and their community. This group is located in the city of Santo Domingo, a community with few resources located north of the capital of the Dominican Republic. \r\n\r\nDaniry is a single woman with three children. She runs a business selling cosmetic products. She has been selling these products for over 4 years.  She started this business because she felt the need to produce to sustain her children. She started selling catalog products and now she sells different brands. \r\n\r\nDaniry is receiving her 4th loan and she is very excited to receive it, because after taking loans from Esperanza International, she has been able to increase her sales and inventory. Her plan for the future is to have a store where she can sell these products and many others. She is very thankful for all your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1041999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

They buy and sell soap, plastic utensils, condiments (peanut butter and peanut oil), millet, peanuts, and porridge. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their capital, the group members joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nMs. Sitan (the second woman standing from left to right in the photo) is a major seller of grains of all qualities in and around the village of Beni. She plans on using her loan to buy 2 sacks of millet at the fair in Cinzana Gare. Cash or credit is accepted for sales to a customer base composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ms. Sitan hopes to make an average monthly profit of 10,000 francs CFA that will be used to reinvest in her business and to take care of her household needs for food. \r\n\r\nJust like the other clients of the group, her ambition is to raise small ruminants in this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1045213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy some millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Beni","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-03-18T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-17T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teibatou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satan          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nah       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140181,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757182,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-21T08:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251951,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410940,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449079,"comment":null},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":41774.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-18T06:32:55Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":401562,"name":"Marlon Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marlon Iv\u00e1n tiene 30 a\u00f1os, es casado su esposa se dedica a los trabajos del hogar,  tiene 3 hijos de 8, 4 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad solo el mayor esta estudiando, vive con su familia en el departamento de Santa Barbar\u00e1, Honduras.\nMarlon su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la agricultura espec\u00edficamente el cultivo del caf\u00e9.
