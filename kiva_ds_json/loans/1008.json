She works sowing basic grains like corn and beans. She grows during several cycles throughout the year. The first and second cycles are the productive cycles during the rainy season in El Salvador. She also has flooded fields, since the river passes through the area where she lives and she retains the water to irrigate the fields. She does this with the help of her husband. They have been doing this activity for more than 10 years. She buys the agricultural supplies that she needs for the planting in an agricultural services store in the city, which is two kilometers from her home. The loan will be invested the purchase of seeds, fertilizer, manure, pest and weed control so that the crop isn't damaged, lease payments on the land, and payment of laborers, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe main need that will be met with the loan is the planting of 7,000 square meters of corn, because the land is ready and they have the workers ready to carry it out. She is also forging the family's future since they will have a higher income that will help out a lot. With the sale of the corn, she will have the income to maintain the family and this way their quality of life will be much better than it is not. Her plan for the future (depending on how the sale of the corn goes) is to purchase 7,000 square meters of land to plant basic grains. She doesn't want to rent land anymore, because in past years it has been costly to rent the land because the landowners already promised it to other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1243438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She started stitching clothes for the women in her vicinity. Adamant about changing her poverty-stricken life, she started her business with an old machine that she got in her dowry. With the passage of time, she has retained many customers.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve her business, Shafqat contacted Kashf Foundation and applied for a loan of PKR 25,000. She intends to use this loan to purchase a new stitching machine, as well as spools of thread and zippers in various colors.

Miriam is an integral part of this; she tells us that she joined Pro Mujer one year ago on the invitation of a friend who is a member of the institution.  She currently has two businesses, one selling lingerie and another running a corner store.  She tells us that the first business she made an incursion into was selling clothing and that with her savings she was able to open the other business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is currently taking out is to increase her capital (to buy lingerie), as a busy season for this business is approaching.  She will buy from the stores that sell wholesale and then sell on foot during the fairs in El Alto.

When she got pregnant with her first child, she needed to find a way to increase income to cover expenses.

With profits earned they invested and built another cart to sell shaved ice; she and her oldest son use this one to work.

She thinks that in future she will manage their sales point by herself because she wants to buy it with her savings.\r\n\r\nThe loan she will take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy furniture in street markets in the city of El Alto and then resell it in her sales space.  This way of working makes it possible for her to generate income to support her family; she\u2019s a widow and has a daughter.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes sharing with her girlfriends.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3950,"image":{"id":1247194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:33:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:33:15Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Reina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora Condorina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":27272.7,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3289.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3426.09},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3426.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":476.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.21},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":496.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":476.46,"local_amount":3289.71,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3292.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331235662,"comment":null},{"amount":496.21,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:11:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339617498,"comment":null},{"amount":496.22,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347172092,"comment":null},{"amount":496.21,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T18:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355914310,"comment":null},{"amount":496.21,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:20:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364625298,"comment":null},{"amount":496.21,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373021257,"comment":null},{"amount":496.22,"local_amount":3426.09,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3428.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381809082,"comment":null},{"amount":496.26,"local_amount":3426.45,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3429.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669167,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T13:37:19Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:16:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502905,"name":"Josefa Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Josefa habitante del municipio de Ticuantepe agricultora de muchos a\u00f1os junto a su familia a sabido aprovechar sus tierras, este credito lo necesita ya que sus cultivos requieren de Mantenimiento y comprara los siguientes insumos y fertilizantes: Urea, Gesepex, Triple 20.

Khurram is a 23-year-old, vigorous, unmarried lady. She has been doing a business of making fancy bangles for the past three years. She is passionate about her work, and client demand is strong.
