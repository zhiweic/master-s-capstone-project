Certainly it is not easy to be a professional and successful lawyer. You must have the necessary qualities such as perseverance, leadership, an analytical mind, and a willingness to study hard. During high school I tried to develop these qualities, and I learned teamwork, dedication, perseverance, honesty, and hard work. I learned English, because it is the language of international communication. I was an active member of the debate club, where we learned to argue and clearly express our opinions.

In most universities, students have to choose their future profession when they finish high school. AUCA is the only university in the country where you can try different subjects and decide later what your future profession will be. I think that I like business, but I also want to try some courses in political science and in psychology.\r\n\r\n\"In high school I did not work as hard as I should have, and I think that I missed some opportunities to learn interesting things. Now that I have the chance to study at AUCA, I am going to be a much more serious student, and also participate in all of the student life activities at the university.

She also lives with her husband's parents. Jyldyzgul has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Jyldyzgul raises livestock, having begun 16 years ago with a livestock purchase of 12,000 som KGS. Her husband helps her in caring for the livestock. The family is very friendly. The daughters are all in school and they help with the housework. <br \/><br \/>Jyldyzgul and her family have a lot of experience caring for livestock.

As a main source of income for her family, Zamira raises livestock, more specifically fattening and breeding domestic animals, having begun 30 years ago with a livestock purchase of 5,000 som KGS. Thanks to her hard work, Zamira currently has on her homestead: one dairy cow and 25 sheep, and also has a plot of land measuring 0.8 hectares, on which she grows cotton, squash, tomatoes and watermelons. Monthly income amounts to 16,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>With the aim of further developing her homestead, Zamira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows for fattening and subsequent sale at the market at a premium. <br \/><br \/>Zamira plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of the quantity of domestic animals, and intends to save money to put on a wedding celebration for her son."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1494262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Joosh village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-20T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-18T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1324.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1425.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":647789,"name":"Gleceria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gleceria is a married woman from Getafe, Bohol.

Her mother lived with him for 5 years, then left him because he made their lives miserable. He didn't provide food and maltreated them. Her mother married another anew, taking Yuri with her to live with another gentleman who apparently loved them. After 6 long years, however, this relationship became difficult due to bad intentions.\r\n\r\nYuri, at just 13 years of age, decided to take charge of her own life with the help of her maternal grandmother. She was obliged to leave her studies in school and go to work for a year. Then she enrolled to study anew, completing the 2 years she lacked (11th and 12th). She used money she earned to pay for supplies, uniforms, and tuition, and had an agreement with her boss concerning hours of work. But after a time, her boss stopped offering her work. She continued to study with what little help her grandmother could provide, managing to complete high school. \r\n\r\nYuri decided to try her luck in [Bogota], the largest city in 2006. By this time she was 16 years old. Her intention was to work but this was more complicated than in the previous city. But still, she gained employment with a friend who had a small shop that sold caps and belts. Through this activity, she met the man who is now her husband. Her hopes were to continue studying because it has always been clear that this is the only thing that could help her to advance. She enrolled in an institute and studied for a semester to be a secretary. But she had to withdraw when she became pregnant and the pregnancy was at high risk. She remained at home with the father of the child and became a housewife. She could not study for the lack of money, nor could she work due to caring for the baby girl.\r\n\r\nAt present, Yuri is studying, thanks to God and her own efforts plus her husband's help. For three people to live on a single salary is complicated, but they know that it is a great investment for life, taking into account the need for a better remuneration and a higher family income. There are often times when they can't meet their monthly bills. For this reason, Yuri was interested in a loan agreement with Kiva, which gives them hope and the confidence that all will be better.\r\n\r\nYuri's family is very united and loving and for that reason, they make the effort and value the opportunity of studying, enjoying each passing day with their daughter and attempting to teach her that she too should struggle for her dreams without overlooking others.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1513712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay fees for a semester in school.

It is made up of 9 members and is led by a board of directors, of which Hortencia is president. The members of this communal bank run a variety of different businesses, among which are: grocery stores and neighborhood markets, seamstresses, and businesses selling jackets, scarves, cakes, and chicharrones (a traditional Bolivian food).\r\n\r\nThis new loan will benefit micro-entrepreneurs like Hortencia. She says that 24 loan cycles ago, she entered the communal bank with Pro Mujer after receiving an invitation from a loan officer who visited her home. Hortencia currently makes a living sewing garments.

Her husband transports passengers between Ulaanbaatar and Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia, Russia, for a living. She has retired from work and gets a state pension. Before retirement, she used to work in a boot factory. Using her previous loan, she completed a house extension, thus living comfortably and warmly in 2013. Recently, her  house roof deteriorated due to the intense bombardment of snow and rain. So she is requesting a loan of 4,000.000 MNT to buy building and insulation material such as shingles, fiberglass, foam and bricks to repair the roof.
