With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will be able to buy or invest in things that they would not otherwise be able to buy or invest in, left with their salaries alone. \r\n\r\nSome usually use these loans to buy plots of land, house-building materials, to pay school fees for their children, to buy pieces of furniture, etc. And at the end of each month, they use their monthly salaries to repay the loan. It is their school\u2019s bursar who is directly responsible for making the deductions and the repayments on their behalf. \r\n\r\nIbrahim is the featured leader of this group. A native of Yoni Banna village, the 40-year-old is married to a housewife, and the couple has four children. Ibrahim has been a teacher for 13 years now. He has requested this loan in order to buy house-building materials like iron corrugated zinc, sand, nails, cement, metal rods, etc., for the construction  of an extension apartment, using the rest of the loan to pay school fees for his son. \r\n\r\n(Attached on the left of the photo are Mohamed and Fatmata;

With the loan, Khatia will rent a trading counter at the local market in the Tkibuli district, purchase clothes at wholesale price, and then sell them for retail price. Khatia will use the profits to reinvest in the same business. This new business initiative, financed by the Kiva start-up loan, will help this young girl start her own business and improve the living conditions of her family.

With the received credit, Merab will purchase 500 chicks and chicken food, grow them and sell them at a profitable price locally in Zestaponi markets.

For us, embossing leather is a family tradition. My father inherited it from his father, and handed it down to us.

Later he established a small workshop, where he achieved such a perfection that soon his products, totally handmade, gained great acceptance and prestige.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to give you all a big hug for supporting our work.

He is the father of 7 children and lives in a traditional family in the town of Loulouni (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Drissa is a vegetable gardener and owns a shed at the market of Loulouni town, where he has been running his business selling fresh vegetables for almost 6 years. His experience in his line of work has earned him a good reputation and many orders.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking assistance from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to have the necessary resources with which to satisfy his customers. This is his 2nd loan. This loan will enable him to buy seeds, small agricultural tools, fertilizer and oil for a power pump. He gets his supplies from the Sikasso Grand Market when he needs them. When he has grown the vegetables he sells his produce for cash, to order and to retail customers in his shed in Loulouni, to a client\u00e8le made up of men and women. Thanks to this loan, he expects to make an average monthly profit of 70 000 francs. Part of this profit will allow him to pay off the loan interest and to cover most of his expenses, and part will be reinvested in his business. He plans to develop his garden so that he can offer enough fresh vegetables to his ever-growing client\u00e8le."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1306794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, small agricultural tools, fertilizer and oil for a power pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Loulouni ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Drissa   Kouyate","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922988,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636544,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373030032,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819533,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678431,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924082,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207309,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":18831.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419971981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T13:11:38Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534231,"name":"Leah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Leah works hard to support her family.

She lives in Tbilisi with her 66-year-old husband, son and retired mother in-law. Naira requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business startup, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNaira works in a restaurant as an assistant to the cook. Her husband is a driver for the local mini-bus and her son bakes bread at the local bakery. They all get very small monthly payments, which is not enough to support themselvs. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNaira requested a loan from Credo to start a family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

She lives in the south west part of the city, where she has a shop which offers washing machine rental services. She has also acquired various goods to sell to clients who initially come in to the shop for rental services. \r\n\r\nShe has been providing services and selling goods for 4 years, since her shop first opened. Looking to generate income to support her household, mainly for her children's expenses, she set up her business and managed to keep it going over the years. Her strong work ethic - she works 13 hours a day, everyday of the week - has enabled her to move forward with her business and create new ways of buying and selling, taking every opportunity to respond to the demands of a client base that is continually growing. \r\n\r\nShe doesn't have enough money to buy all the machinery she needs to satisfy client demand, which is why she is requesting a Kiva loan. It is her first loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy 3 washing machines and other goods that she requires to fulfill her orders. \r\n\r\nShe expects the Kiva loan to be successful because it will be used in the context of her business where she has ample experience and because she will be able to satisfy her clients who many times have had to leave empty-handed because she cannot keep up with demand. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is to save up enough money to be able to buy her own house one day and to be able to improve her family's well-being.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":428.48,"image":{"id":1307040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"to buy 3 washing machines and various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68664},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78433},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80263},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82136},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84053},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86014},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88021},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90075},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92176},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94327},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96528},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109310}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.82},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.24,"local_amount":68664,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":71144.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527883,"comment":null},{"amount":44.82,"local_amount":78433,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81266.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928626,"comment":null},{"amount":45.86,"local_amount":80263,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83163.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705773,"comment":null},{"amount":46.93,"local_amount":82136,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-26T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85103.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968068,"comment":null},{"amount":48.04,"local_amount":84053,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":87089.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817263,"comment":null},{"amount":49.15,"local_amount":86014,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89121.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323533,"comment":null},{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":88021,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":91201.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082771,"comment":null},{"amount":51.48,"local_amount":90075,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":93329.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062146,"comment":null},{"amount":52.67,"local_amount":92176,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95506.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T17:07:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534279,"name":"Ma.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nIrenea operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 12,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\n\r\nIrenea hopes that her variety store will become a grocery store and dreams of having more customers.

Eighteen years ago, she began making handicrafts and leather goods, a profession she started learning when she took a weaving class at a religious school when she was 10. She also learned cooking and other crafts, which became her main source of income as an adult. People began to take notice of her merchandise, and over time she bought equipment for her house, including an over-stitch machine. Her friends recommended her, and she has built a market that supports her. \r\n\r\nCarmen makes a variety of artesania, leather goods, painted frames, mulit-use items, underwear,  biscuits, and even special foods in her workshop. She sells for cash and also offers credit terms of one month. She pays cash for her supplies at specialized warehouses that offer fittings, accessories, and more. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand and eventually buy a house at the corner, where she can boost sales, feel more comfortable, and better serve her customer. She is applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy leather, acrylic boards, steel knives, a millstone, grinders, glues, fittings, hemp, and frames. Her biggest challenge is to keep supporting her children in their college studies. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":461.75,"image":{"id":1307115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy leather, acrylic boards, steel knives, a millstone, grinders, glues, fittings, hemp, and frames.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1170000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72872},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87312},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89350},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91434},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93568},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95751},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97985},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100272},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":102611},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":105006},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":107456},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":126383}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.51},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":72872,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-18T08:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":73407.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527885,"comment":null},{"amount":98.15,"local_amount":176662,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":177960.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928628,"comment":null},{"amount":50.8,"local_amount":91434,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":92106.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705775,"comment":null},{"amount":51.98,"local_amount":93568,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-26T08:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":94255.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968070,"comment":null},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":95751,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:45:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96454.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323535,"comment":null},{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":97985,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":98705.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082773,"comment":null},{"amount":55.71,"local_amount":100272,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":101009.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062147,"comment":null},{"amount":57,"local_amount":102611,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":103365.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439731843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T02:29:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":535040,"name":"Milagro Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Milagro del Rosario, es trabajadora, luchadora, responsable, solidaria.

Shafoat got married after finishing a secondary school.  Not having pursued a higher education, she was left without any type of profession.  She started having issues with money after giving birth to her children.  Her husband was involved in farming, but his income was barely enough for living.  Shafoat became involved in farming after the children grew up.  Currently, she needs more money than ever before because her children grew up and have to get married.  With the goal of obtaining a new source of income, she decided to start her own business in animal husbandry.  She completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Association of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  Shafoat came to IMON to obtain a loan in the amount of 2500 somoni to buy livestock.  She awaits your kindness because her family budget and children's future depend on this new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1305854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock and start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-03-06T19:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-05T19:00:01Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shafoat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.11,"local_amount":0.5,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":0.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510314,"comment":null},{"amount":549.89,"local_amount":2499.5,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915601,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-06T23:29:52Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534366,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is 49 years old, married, with one child.

The family resides in a Mongolian traditional five-walled ger (portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. His wife renders tailoring service to the local people, and before doing this, she worked as a janitor at a kindergarten. His eldest daughter is studying at college to become an elementary school teacher. His four-year-old daughter goes to kindergarten. He himself at one time held the position of driver at a private business entity. In 2012, he began rendering taxi services to the local people, and this was a better income generator compared to his full-time driver position. The automobile he uses for taxi service has been damaged and needs some serious repairs.

years old and married.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1982.  The initial capital for this business amounted to 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Rakhiyabu's persistent work, she was able to grow her business to have two dairy cows and twenty sheep, and yield about 8,000 som from sales of milk and dairy products and reselling livestock.  In order to further develop her business, Rakhiyabu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a year-old calf for fattening up because this year's prices are low, but expected to rise.

With the received credit, Kakhaber will purchase a mini-bus. He will be driving himself and serve the local people by transporting them from their district to different villages.

He purchases his supplies in Bamako and retails his merchandise for cash at his shop in Loulouni. His clientele is composed of both men and women. With this loan, Issouf expects to earn an average monthly income of 90,000 FCFA. This income will allow him to pay the interest on his loan and pay for his expenses.

The members are involved in various businesses, including the knitting of sweaters; the sewing of clothing for sports; the sale of meat, groceries, wool and baby sweaters; and a babysitting business.\r\n\r\nThe loan they are seeking will benefit these small businesses, one of which is Monica's.  She reports that two years ago she joined Pro Mujer at the invitation of an outreach worker who visited her home.  Currently she has a business selling meat.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNikoloz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Nikoloz will purchase two milk cows.

","en":"Toktokan is 58 years old and a widow. In search of a source of income for her family, Toktokan started her business of livestock breeding and field crop cultivation in 1996, with a starting sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Toktokan's persistent work, her business with livestock today brings in around 9,500 som (KGS) in monthly income. Currently she owns 2.4 hectares of land, 3 heads of cattle and 20 sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Toktokan turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of livestock and for fodder.

He lives in the small village of Zestaponi District with his wife, two children, and parents. Several times, Dimitri requested loan from local financial institutions for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nDimitri works as a guard at local private company and gets a monthly income. In addition, the family has a dairy business. In particular, they have two milk cows and they produce cheese products to sell at local markets. The income is too small and is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the 'subsistence poor' category. \r\n\r\nDimitri requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Dimitri will purchase chicks, raise them, and then resell them at a higher price. This will increase the income of the family.

Gulsunda requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but her requests were consistently rejected due to low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nGulsunda sells perfume, buying at wholesale prices and selling with price markups to the local citizens.  She also has a commercial space at the local market that she is renting out. Additionally, the family is persecuted, so they get a monthly income from the government. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.  <p>\r\n\r\nGulsunda requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income.

Thus she is thankful for having other sources of income aside from retailing.

She began this business with a little capital and with the purpose of contributing to her home's income; the family had grown with two daughters and her husband's work was not enough to maintain the entire family.\r\n\r\nPresently, the girls are of school age and their education demands a larger expense for the family.  The carbonated beverages she orders are delivered to her house when the distributer company passes by, and the buying that she does for her clothing sales is done in the Eastern market, which is located in the city of Managua; she has to travel to get there.  She recently decided to additionally make lunches in order to grow her income, and she is attracting clients. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, she needs to invest in her business; this is why she is requesting financing that will help her with the demand of her store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":440.11,"image":{"id":1307218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy personal-size Coca Cola bottles, Big Cola in 360mL bottles, Big Cola in 500mL bottles, Coca Cola in 500mL bottles, Coca Cola in liter bottles, women's and men's pants, varied women's blouses, unisex children's outfits, and men's shirts. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-03-07T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-06T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":916.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1050.6},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1079.51},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1136.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1220.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.06},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1319.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1387.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.2,"local_amount":916.72,"processed_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":927.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494171,"comment":null},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":1050.6,"processed_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115461,"comment":null},{"amount":44.98,"local_amount":1079.51,"processed_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675113,"comment":null},{"amount":47.36,"local_amount":1136.59,"processed_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539393,"comment":null},{"amount":48.83,"local_amount":1171.95,"processed_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788630,"comment":null},{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":1220.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:30:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410064952,"comment":null},{"amount":53.29,"local_amount":1279.06,"processed_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419828836,"comment":null},{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":1319.54,"processed_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1335.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384622,"comment":null},{"amount":57.83,"local_amount":1387.76,"processed_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T14:57:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534660,"name":"Efrena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efrena is 51 years old and married with five children.
