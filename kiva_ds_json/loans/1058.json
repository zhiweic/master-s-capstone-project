She joined One Acre Fund in order to gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer, and to get the best input prices.\r\n\r\nPhilice managed to harvest three bags of maize on one acre of land, last year.

I work with all kinds of materials \u2013 corn husks, plantain leaves, kente cloth, fabric, leather, plywood, foam, raffia, twine and cotton cord. I've had the opportunity to teach over a hundred young people how to weave with corn husks.

Charlie accepted a driving position at a trucking company four years ago, he never dreamed he would someday venture off on his own as an independent contractor.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever in a million years did I think I\u2019d be doing this,\u201d Charlie says.\r\n\r\nWhile it wasn\u2019t his original goal, Charlie has excelled in his work and found his niche. Being self-employed is just the appropriate next step. Charlie will use his Kiva loan to help him purchase his own truck, the primary expense to being an independent contractor. \r\n\r\nCharlie looks forward to the opportunity. He says, for his personality, it\u2019s much more motivating to be paid in the stops and miles versus in hours worked. \r\n\r\n\u201cI love making my own schedule, going to work when I feel like it, and being more independent overall,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nCharlie was born and raised in New Orleans and although some jobs take him to other locations around Southeast Louisiana, he says he enjoys that most of his days are spent driving around the city, hauling shipping containers on his truck. \r\n\r\n\u201cBeing on the road every day, you get to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says.  \r\n\r\nCharlie is ready to revel in his new freedom as his own boss, but at the same time, he already has his eye on the future. His ultimate goal is to purchase at least two or three additional trucks and hire drivers under him. He likes the idea of creating jobs in the community and helping others get their start in a career he finds rewarding.\r\n\r\nTo get there, Charlie will be diligently saving his profits. While it can be difficult to put away savings, Charlie says it\u2019s easy when you know exactly what you are going to do with the funds. Despite not envisioning this path four years ago, today Charlie says he knows exactly where he\u2019s going and looks forward to growing his business for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3182.33,"image":{"id":1295539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

These five hardworking women belong to a non-tribal community and live in a small village located in Northeastern India in the state of Manipur. They believe in collective effort as a group to support one another and pave the way for a better fortune.\r\n\r\nMusuk is the profile representative of the group, photographed with her hand raised. She is the mother of two children and has been maintaining the family affairs with the meagre income from her husband's carpentry activities. In order to supplement the family income, she decided to start working on some activities so she can earn for the family. Before the loan, she was growing vegetables for consumption in her homestead garden.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, with her first loan, she started an embroidery business to generate her income. Mainly, she embroiders the borderline of the traditional wrap-rounds. She has a sewing machine. She will use this loan to purchase thread in colours and needles for her work.  Her embroidery work has been a success and, in the course of time, she can pay back the loan.\r\n\r\nMusuk wishes to include poultry as another activity for better income opportunity. Her interest in poultry was fulfilled after she bought chicks and ducklings and raised them. Her dream is to purchase a used mini truck, which she believes is a need for the villagers to cart all the essential goods in the village. She would charge a fixed carrier cost.\r\n\r\nMusuk needs another loan to continue with her embroidery work and start her new poultry farm. She will use this loan to purchase chicks to raise and sell for profit. Likewise, the rest of her group members have made steady improvement and need another loan for their respective income activities such as weaving, embroidery and selling vegetables, to mention a few.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1294371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy thread in colours for embroidering and to buy chicks to raise and sell for profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-02-17T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-19T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bidumukhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musuk","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nganbi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-02-17T21:53:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":528456,"name":"Leng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leng is aged 44 years and widowed.

She says that her most difficult challenge is to live well. She wants to have a successful business and her own safe and beautiful house. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying watching television, especially Latin series.\r\n\r\nThis is Martira's 16th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and growing her business. She has had her business for almost four years, although she has been selling clothing for more than five years, starting with the loans she received from Esperanza.

Luz makes her home in a simple structure with her long-time partner and their four children.\r\n\r\nLuz is excited to be taking her 17th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her cafeteria by purchasing necessary products such as bread, cheese, ham, beans, sweets (candies), and other comestible items as well as a blender.\r\n\r\nLuz will use the profits to improve her business, to rebuild her house, and to provide for her family's needs. She dreams that her children will grow up to be good people. She thanks you all for your support.

","en":"Holmurot is a 38 year old man living in a rural area.  He is married and has two children.  His wife doesn't work because she doesn't have a higher education.  Holmurot also only finished high school.  He is a peasant farmer.  But what he earns on the collective farm isn't enough to get by on.  Several years ago, Holmurot decided to get into the business of raising cattle since this brings a very good income.  He raises cattle that he buys at the market while they are still calves.  After raising them and fattening them up, he sells them at an advantageous price.  His wife helps him in her free time.  \r\n\r\nHolmurot's children are already no longer small and it's his dream that they study in an institute of higher education.  Because of this, he and his wife are developing their business and saving money for their children's education.  After all, if they get a higher education, they'll be able to work in dignified profession.  \r\n\r\nHolmurot is planning to use this loan to buy livestock feed because he is out of feed and there is no forage in the winter.  He is very grateful to Kiva for the financial help and

Despite his solitude he is a good, hardworking and responsible man. Mamadali has decided not to marry again. \r\n\r\nHe has since childhood worked with fattening cattle, which he learned from his father. He knows this business very well. Currently he has one calf and one dairy cow. He milks the cow himself and every day sells 10 liters of milk to his neighbors and acquaintances. \r\n\r\nMamadali also works with buying and reselling cattle. Cattle breeding is Mamadali's only income. For the loan, Mamadali plans to purchase livestock and fatten until spring, to sell at a favorable price. After having saved up money he would like to refurbish his house in the summer, as the house is currently in bad conditions. Mamadali expresses his thankfulness to the Kiva organization for the financial help and support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":814.84,"image":{"id":1293113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-02-17T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-19T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.47},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2013-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":92.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.85},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.47},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.1,"local_amount":73.1,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":73.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355863713,"comment":null},{"amount":74.85,"local_amount":74.85,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":74.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364572656,"comment":null},{"amount":76.64,"local_amount":76.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":76.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971426,"comment":null},{"amount":78.47,"local_amount":78.47,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":78.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381751935,"comment":null},{"amount":80.34,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616008,"comment":null},{"amount":82.26,"local_amount":82.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":82.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399859878,"comment":null},{"amount":84.23,"local_amount":84.23,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136627,"comment":null},{"amount":86.24,"local_amount":86.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900822,"comment":null},{"amount":88.3,"local_amount":88.3,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":88.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550012,"comment":null},{"amount":90.41,"local_amount":90.41,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":90.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-05T06:09:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":528513,"name":"Dorjpurev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr.Dorjpurev is 26 years old and lives with his parents in a ger in the Bayanhongor province of Mongolia.

","en":"Mavluda is a 47 years old and she is a very decent, kindhearted, and dependable woman.  She is married and has three children.  Her children are already adults and they live with their own families.  Mavluda and her husband live in a mountainous region.  They raise cattle because this business is well-suited for the mountains.  In the mountainous regions, animal husbandry is people's main source of income and Mavluda has been doing this since she was young.  She also spins yarn from the wool of her sheep and goats, which she sells to wholesale buyers.\r\n\r\nMavluda's husband often travels to the Russian Federation to earn extra money, but it's not very much.  Because of this, they need to expand their business of raising cattle.

She plans to pay for her son's university fees in Cyprus. She is so happy that she is capable of providing her children with the best education ever. She hopes they will have a brighter future since their lives in Lebanon have no chance to expand because all the Palestinian refugees have limited access to some businesses.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mouna's third cycle as an Al Majmoua borrower. She has a good-standing history of paying back loans. Her previous loans helped a lot in expanding her business and improving her family's social living. She hopes to further expand and enhance her business in the future. \r\n

She is 48 years old, married and the mother of 5 children, the eldest of whom is 20 years old and the youngest, 13. Three of her children go to school and she is not responsible for any other people. She was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has 2 years of primary school education. She started working together with ACB in 2012 and is on her first loan cycle. She will use the loan requested to rent a field, pay the labourers and buy seeds. Donathile anticipates only one problem which could prevent repayment of the loan; climate change.

She is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to pay the remaining payment for the automobile. As a result, the car will be theirs which will be used for transportation services and more importantly, natural gas powered cars have benefits of emitting less smoke, thus, contributing to the efforts against air pollution.

His loan requests were rejected each time because he did not meet income requirements and he lacks experience in new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nBut David\u2019s loan request was approved by Credo, as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-ups and re-startups. The program extends soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products. They are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, David will cover the costs of purchasing his initial inventory of basic groceries for starting a grocery store. He plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. Another part of the credit will be used for purchasing a milk cow. After the cow is bought, the family will produce cheese with the milk and sell it from their grocery store. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. David will work hard, and he will be able to improve the living conditions of his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular, available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market in the event they need it in the
