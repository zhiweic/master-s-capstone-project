old, married, and is raising 5 children.  Her youngest is a daughter who will soon turn 2.  Salamat has received a higher education and has been working with livestock since 1998.  She also offers shepherd services.  She started her business initially with 30,000 KGS.  Today, in her care, Salamat has 1 horse and 6 sheep.  She brings in around 8,000 KGS a month from the sale of cattle.

","en":"Karagyz is 47 years old, married and has 2 children.  Karagyz grew up in a family of farmers; her parents have been involved with livestock for a very long time.  Two years ago, with their wide range of experience and knowledge, Karagyz and her family begin to work with livestock as well.  Currently, she has a well-developed business and brings in around 10,000 KGS monthly from the sale of milk and other dairy products.

He was born into a large family of farmers.  In his childhood, he helped his father care for a large farm, and in doing so, he acquired many skills.  By profession, Japar is a teacher and has worked for many years in a rural school.  However, since the pay in Kyrgyzstan is very little, the main source of income for him and his family is livestock and farming.  Japar has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy sheep and fertilizers for his land.  Japar's business plans involve expanding his farm.

She has raised 4 children; her youngest, a daughter, is in elementary school.  Her son is currently working in Russia.  Her husband and son help Kanayim in her work.  She is, by character, a very nice and sympathetic woman.  She is very sociable and energetic.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, the family began working in agriculture.  Now, the family raises cattle and crops.  The gross annual income for the family is around 150,000 KGS.

He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a water pump so that he may irrigate his vegetable farm.\n\nOscar started his business of farming vegetables for the local market in 2003. Currently he produces fresh maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. While his business is growing at a fast rate, his farm remains small and is limited by the seasons. He is also unable to expand his current crops as he is forced to fetch water with a bucket.\n\nEquipment such as a water pump can be a major boost for many vegetable farmers such as Oscar, as it allows for increased production and more predictable yields due to irrigation. Unfortunately, it is rare to find equipment such as a water pump in such a remote region of the country, and transport to the capital city (two days travel) can be prohibitive. Once Oscar secures a loan, he will be able to get a water pump from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to his farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.\n\nWith a pump, whether in the rainy season or dry season, Oscar will be able to produce and sell a range of produce throughout the year, unlike at the moment where he has a shortage of water during the dry season. The use of a pump will also mean that he can irrigate a larger portion of land in less time and not be restricted by the labor-intensive task of carrying water by hand to his field.\n\nOscar added that when he starts producing more products, he would like to extend his business to be able to serve markets in other nearby communities.\n\nIt is for this reason Oscar is appealing to the Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a water pump as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1303869,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2844,"youtubeId":"Au8e1Enkglc","title":"Kiva Borrower

The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Venera will purchase clothes at wholesale price and then sell them for profit in her district among her neighbors. Venera will use the profit for reinvesting in the same business and renovating her house to have better conditions for her granddaughter.

She hopes the manure will increase her plantain production and she will therefore invest the gained profit in her restaurant and hopefully her revenue will eventually double. She can then construct a building to house her restaurant in the future instead of renting. She is optimistic about her family's future,  especially now that she will be partnering with Kiva lenders.

The only source of income for the family is the small monthly retirement pension of Gulo and her husband. Seasonally, the family sells the harvested maize that was grown on the family-owned land. It is hardly enough for the family to cover everyday expanses. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nGulo requested a loan from Credo to start a dairy farm. Her loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up program loans money for business start-ups and \"re-startups.\" It provides access to credit with less rigid conditions for the country's rural poor, who usually do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, Gulo will purchase a milk cow. She will place it in the old, empty farm building located in their yard. She will work hard on the farm. She will produce cheese and sell it in the village.

Claudia is requesting a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying ingredients for making her traditional dishes and to stock her store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":382.67,"image":{"id":1303487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for preparing traditional dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-03-02T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-01T14:50:10Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Yanira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.97},{"due_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":56.76},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.68},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.26},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.76},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.97,"local_amount":37.97,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356448278,"comment":null},{"amount":38.73,"local_amount":38.73,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":38.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364451433,"comment":null},{"amount":39.05,"local_amount":39.05,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082548,"comment":null},{"amount":40.45,"local_amount":40.45,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382265368,"comment":null},{"amount":45.86,"local_amount":45.86,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":45.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390739973,"comment":null},{"amount":25.1,"local_amount":25.1,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":25.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411736708,"comment":null},{"amount":49.07,"local_amount":49.07,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":49.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419769048,"comment":null},{"amount":46.15,"local_amount":46.15,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":46.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430001536,"comment":null},{"amount":60.29,"local_amount":60.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441329292,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-17T19:39:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":532625,"name":"Behzod","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Behzod is 31 years old and is married with two children.

His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor for business start-ups and restart-ups. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. With the loan, Mevludi will purchase chickens to restart a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard. He will raise them to sell them for a higher price. He hopes that the new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":435.75,"image":{"id":1302932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

The profits from the business will be used to reinvest in the business.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

She is grateful to God for the strength He has given her to raise and provide for her six children and get through challenging situations.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Magdalena works from 7:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night. One of her daughters-in-law helps her in the store and with some of the household chores. In hopes of increasing her inventory and offering clients a wider variety of products, Magdalena is requesting this loan. She plans to use the support from the loan to purchase products to stock her general store. She hopes that this investment will help her to generate more business and profits, and will in turn improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1303983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She sells her produce from a stall in a market, which is a great location for attracting new customers. Rosa Alicia already has a wide customer base, since she sells fresh, high quality produce at affordable prices and with excellent service.\r\n\r\nRosa Alicia is an entrepreneurial woman who is dedicated to her work and goals in life, and she is always looking for new opportunities to grow her business and succeed. In recent weeks, customer demand for her produce has increased substantially, and she is now looking for new ways to keep up with demand and invest in her business. Since she does not have the capital necessary to keep up with client demand, she is requesting this loan from INTEGRAL.

He joined the group with an aim of accessing credit to better his business operations. The main challenges he faces are finding customers for his current business and seasonal weather.\r\n\r\nJoseph is applying for a loan of 15,900 Kenyan shillings to buy seedlings and fertilizers.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nBalbina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat only home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nBalbina hopes her business will expand and dreams that the time will come when she will no longer need to borrow money. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and then selling them by the piece.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.  She is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan to help her continue in the operation of her business.  She will use the loan to expand her product inventory by purchasing groceries, toiletries, and beverages.\r\n\r\nEdna hopes to expand her business and dreams to have their own house.  She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with two of her children who work and both have a university education, thanks to Marta's efforts. Now, they help her out with the household expenses. For fifteen years, Martha has been self-employed, selling day-to-day basics like food items, cleaning products, sweets, etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Martha is hoping to grow her store further, which is why she's seeking a loan with INTEGRAL. With the loan, she will be able to buy a greater quantity of various items, including: eggs, sodas, juices, french bread, baked goods, candies, snack foods, coffee, and other goods that her customers are looking for. With this loan, Martha is quite confident that she will be able to achieve higher earnings and get ahead in life.
