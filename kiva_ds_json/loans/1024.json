Gevorg used to have a business where different kinds of fruits and vegetables were sold, but he stopped this because he joined military service. He has recently returned from service and decided to restart his trading business, but his current savings are not enough to implement his plan.\r\nHis loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up and re-startup credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Gevorg will purchase fruit and vegetables at wholesale prices and take them to sell at his open market store. Gevorg plans to increase the turnover in his trade business gradually. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of his family. Gevorg will work hard and will be able to improve the living conditions for himself and his family.

She is 19 years old.  She isn't married and lives with her parents.  Since her childhood, she has always dreamed of becoming a wealthy businesswoman.  She studied in a course on dressmaking and she already has several years of experience in this field.  She now wants to turn her handicraft into a business.  With this aim, she studied in a course called \"Attain Success\" that is put on by the Association of Business Women, and she received her graduation certificate.  She is fully capable of starting her own business since she has the skills for this field.  \r\n\r\nShohida will sew traditional women's dresses and sell them at the local market.

Rysbubu has a higher education in teaching, having married after graduating.  She is a retiree, but aside from her pension their family's income comes from animal husbandry and farming.  As a result of Rysbubu's hard work, she now has two milk cows, 40 sheep, and one head of other cattle.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Rysbubu applied to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy young cattle, which she will fatten and sell.

She was born and raised in this village and she is very well adapted to the village way of life.  She knows all the ins and outs of eastern life and she skillfully uses her know-how to put her plans into action in the village setting.  Guliston is married and has one child.  She always tries her hardest for the family's well-being.  She starts doing household chores early in the morning and she bakes such big and tasty flatbreads that her husband calls them \"finger-licking good.\"\r\n\r\nDespite their support of one another, Guliston and her husband aren't able to improve their living conditions, so Guliston decided to start her own business for the family's well-being.  With this aim, she studied in a course called \"Attain Success\" that is put on by the Association of Business Women, and she received her graduation certificate.  She wants to start a business trading cattle, since she has experience in this field.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of $1,000 (USD) to buy cattle in order to start her business.  She is relying on your kindness.  This loan will help her improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1263906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle to start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kumsangir","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.412778 68.684444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2012-12-25T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-24T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guliston","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78.02},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.35},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85.49},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":94.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.02},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.37,"local_amount":74.37,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-02T09:58:54Z","rounded_local_amount":74.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339740993,"comment":null},{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":75.36,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-22T08:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":75.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347056287,"comment":null},{"amount":83.96,"local_amount":83.96,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355801982,"comment":null},{"amount":72.59,"local_amount":72.59,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":72.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510226,"comment":null},{"amount":80.72,"local_amount":80.72,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915509,"comment":null},{"amount":83.97,"local_amount":83.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693222,"comment":null},{"amount":529.03,"local_amount":529.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":529.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556024,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T14:42:31Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:57:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":511523,"name":"Ezekiel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ezekiel is a married man living in the Likoni area of the coast province in Kenya.

is a 57-year-old married woman with five children. Shukufa has been breeding cattle and cows for the past ten years. She and her husband live on a pension, which is too small. When they had jobs, they had enough salary, and breeding cows was not primarily the source of income. However, after retirement, living got harder, and now, breeding cattle and cows have become primarily the source of income in her family. \r\n\r\nShukufa usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them for 5-6 months, then resells for more profitable prices in the livestock bazaar. Her monthly income is 120 AZN and this business is the only source of financial income in her family. Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.

She has been selling refined oil and palm oil at a local market for 30 years. It is not a profit-making business when supplies are bought retail; profits are minimal and stock shortages constant because she is forced to use up all of her stock before being able to get new supplies, and the transport costs are high. Therefore, she would like to buy several cans of oil wholesale. This would allow her to minimise stock shortages and would reduce her transport costs, as well as increasing her capital, her sales and thus her profits.

Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing their profit

is pictured inside his store.\r\n\r\nRaed is a 25-year-old single young man. For the past four years, he has been operating a mobile phone store, selling different types of mobile phones and accessories to customers. His project is well known in the market and has a lot of loyal customers. It has been profitable and is the only source of income for Raed, but it needs more liquidity to cover some necessary costs.\r\n\r\nRaed is requesting a shariah-compliant Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a new collection of mobile phones and accessories. This will attract more new customers and satisfy his loyal ones, increasing his sales and improving his income.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

El origen del nombre viene del mapudungun (lengua mapuche): \"kila\", que significa \u201ctres\u201d y \"kura\" que significa \u201cpiedra\u201d, por lo que se deduce que el nombre equivale a \"tres piedras\", como  el nombre que le dieron los primeros habitantes de este valle en referencia a los tres cerros que son perfectamente visibles. \n","en":"This communal bank, El Remolino, is made up of 21 entrepreneurs who make a living in various businesses, including market stall, clothing sales, toy sales, lingerie, vegetable sales, household items sales, services, and other areas.  All are from the community of Quilicura in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nJacqueline is the president of the communal bank group.  In the photograph she's seated in the first row, the first from the left, wearing a black-and-white shirt.  Her hair is dark brown and she's wearing it back with sunglasses on her head.\r\n\r\nShe has made a living in the open-air market and packaging business for two years.  She says she sets up her stall in an open-air market, selling everything to her customers.  She works Friday, Saturday, and Sunday according to her availability.  She buys the merchandise and supplies she needs in the city of Santiago, where she finds a wide variety of articles and novelties at economically advantageous low costs.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she'll buy Christmas items and packaging products.\r\n\r\nOne of Jacqueline's goals is to grow and always have current merchandise to sell to her customers so she can generate greater income and have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJacqueline lives with her husband and her children, ages 10 and 9.  Her dream for her family is to have her own house to give her children a good home; for work, to continue with her job and grow every day.\r\n\r\nShe's very grateful for and happy about this opportunity from Fondo Esperanza because it lets her invest in her business.  She says the trainings have been fundamental for her business as well as her personal development because she has learned to better organize and distribute her income and investments.\r\n\r\nQuilicura is a commune in the capital of Chile, located in the far northeast part of the metropolitan region. The origin of the name is from Mapudungun (the Mapuche language): \"kila\" 'three' and \"kura\" 'rock.'  So the name Quilicura means \"Three Rocks,\" the name given by the first inhabitants of this valley to the three hills that are perfectly visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6325,"image":{"id":1264750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She started her business fifteen years ago, motivated by the need to generate additional income for her household to help cover the basic household expenses.  Her children support her, which encourages Lida to keep moving forward. \r\nLida likes her works because it allows her to stay in the comfort of her home, to take care of her children and to dedicate her free time to other things.

Her family now enjoys financial security, thanks to the joint effort of all her family members.  On the other hand, she doesn't like that at times she has to walk for hours selling her products.

With the loan of 2000 nuevos soles ($800 USD) that Lida is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of a variety of merchandise, like towels, sheets, clothing and sandals.

She lives with businessman Cayo, the father of her two children, Erick (19 years old) and Brayan (18).  They live together in their house which they bought after a lot of hard work.  Nelly works selling pre-cut wood, such as strips and boards for walls and floors.  She buys the wood from the sawmills and sells it out of her house, where she has a space set-up for this work.  She is friendly with her customers who now favour her with their business and she is highly recommended.  With her own capital, Nelly started this work two years ago, when she sold wood in small quantities.  Sales grew thanks to emand for the product.  She is occasionally supported by her partner in the little spare time he has.  Nelly thinks the business is quite profitable because of the profits she earns, which come from the warm reception she offers.  Before starting this work, she was having financial difficulties with the rising costs of having children. She needed to support her partner with these costs, so she chose to take on this work.  Seeing the positive results that she has had all this time, she would like to continue with her business.  This will be her twelfth loan with MFP.  Thanks to this communal bank, she is happy to count on the working capital they provide her, as this is how she will be able to fulfill all her pending orders.

She's very happy because she's able to generate income for her household, and previously she only had whatever financial help her partner offered her.\r\n\r\nShe likes what she does a lot because she's able to have her own money and contribute to the household finances since she has worked in this business.

She has been living with her partner William, who is 38, for the last 6 years, and they have a 2-year-old son. She lives with her partner's mother and they all help to raise her son who they want to have a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nLucia rents out a taxi to a driver who goes to her house every day to pick up the vehicle which he uses on the main streets of the city. Lucia earns money from renting out the taxi which helps her to cover some of the household expenses. However, her vehicle needs to be in good working condition, and that is why Lucia needs to take good care of it every day, making sure that it is clean on the outside as well as checking that all the internal systems are working correctly. A mechanic helps her with this task. She also takes care of the car's documents which always need to be up-to-date so as not to cause any problems with the transit police. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this for 2 years after buying the taxi with her own money earned from working very hard in her previous businesses selling food and clothes. She eventually ended up going back to both of these businesses. She likes her work because it gives her time to take care of her baby who needs a lot of attention because he is still very young, and in the future she will be able to do other work to provide her with more income and improve her quality of life. Unfortunately, things have not always gone so well, and at the beginning it was difficult for her to start her business because she didn't know much about it, but with time, she learned new skills, and now she feels happy to be doing what she is doing, and she hopes to be able to buy another taxi in the future and eventually have a larger business. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan from the MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has the financial support to help her to grow her business. She pledges to make punctual repayments as she has always done with her previous loans. She is also happy to belong to the bank because all of the members are very responsible and supportive. With the amount requested (S\/.1500), she will buy some car parts and tires, and have her taxi serviced by a professional. She will also get the car's documents up-to-date, buy auto liability insurance, and make some repairs to be able to keep her business running.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1264887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to have her taxi serviced and to purchase car insurance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-26T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-25T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":218.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":229.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":249.73},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":259.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":274.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":218.77,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":224.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573120,"comment":null},{"amount":91.6,"local_amount":229.01,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:01Z","rounded_local_amount":234.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122762,"comment":null},{"amount":99.89,"local_amount":249.73,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":255.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868587,"comment":null},{"amount":103.62,"local_amount":259.05,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":265.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577419,"comment":null},{"amount":107.49,"local_amount":268.71,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":275.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529656,"comment":null},{"amount":109.89,"local_amount":274.73,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":281.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974688,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-26T23:25:49Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":511900,"name":"Jesus Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario es  estado civil casada no tiene hijos vive con el esposo  en el Recinto TARIRA perteneciente al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de Los R\u00edos. \n\nPertenece a la Ventanilla RENACER se encuentra ubicada el  recinto TARIRA, perteneciente al cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedica a labores agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias. \n\nRosario se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz y arroz.

She is still single and has no children.  She lives in her parents' home along with her brother.  They all work together everyday to be able to have a better quality of life.  Renata works preparing and selling fast food.  She has a \"broasteria\" (rotisserie restaurant) where she works together with her parents.  Renata gets up very early in the morning and goes with her mother to the market.  They look for the freshest and most nutritious meats and products to work with.  They always offer their distinguished customers the best.  At home, in the afternoons, they prepare what they need and have everything ready by 6:00pm, which is when they start selling their delicious and well-prepared plates of \"pollo broaster\" (rotisserie chicken).  The business has been running for eight years, but Renata is now in charge.  She has been working there for about two years.  The \"broasteria\" was previously run by her parents.  With the income that the business generates, Renata can cover the costs of Veterinary School.  A lot of the time, Renata's schooling expenses don't leave enough money for other activities.  The business is going well, and they earn a good enough income to surpass their previous difficulties.  Renata is now very optimistic in everything she does.  Her longer-term goal is to expand her business, but for now she just hopes to establish herself and progress little by little.  This is Renata's sixth loan with MFP.  As such, she is grateful to those who make her loan possible and allow her to continue working toward her objectives.  In addition, she is very committed to punctually complying with her repayment plan, just like she did with her previous loans.  Renata is very happy to belong to her communal bank, as all of the members are good, friendly and supportive people. \r\nWith the requested sum of S\/.3500 ($1375 USD), Renata will purchase tables, chairs and materials to improve the condition of her store front, like fixing up the ceiling and the floor.

She is married to Luis, who is a businessman and father to her two-year-old daughter. He wants to give her a better quality of life. Together, they live in their own home that they worked hard to buy.\r\n\r\nJessica sells soda in a variety of flavors and brands. She uses a refrigerator where she stores her products at chilly temperatures, which is what her customers like because the area is warm. She serves her customers in a very friendly way from her home. She started her business more than two years ago, purchasing stock in small amounts with her own money. Seeing the good reception her business was getting, she decided to continue, and, until now, she has worked alone.\r\n\r\nShe feels her business is fairly successful because of the good income it gives her. Before, she had financial troubles because her husband's earnings were not enough, and with the arrival of her daughter, their expenses increased. Jessica decided to start her business, which now helps her through tough economic times.\r\n\r\nSeeing the good results and the reception that she continues to have, Jessica plans to increase her stock and grow her business with the money she will earn through the carpentry business that she has with her husband. (Through that same business), she has the know-how for this task. This will be her third loan with Kiva partner MFP. She is pleased to know that she can count on this line of credit to grow. She likes working with her communal bank because she considers the group responsible and united.\r\n\r\nWith the money requested, 1,500 nuevos soles, she will purchase more merchandise for her business, such as soda in a variety of flavors, growing her stock available for sale, and looking for more precious commodities to purchase in volume."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1265034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"purchase soda in a variety of flavors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-26T21:41:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-25T21:41:04Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":225.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":238.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":247.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":248.8},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":265.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":274.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.29},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.28},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.52},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.29,"local_amount":225.72,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":231.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573130,"comment":null},{"amount":95.28,"local_amount":238.2,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":244.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122772,"comment":null},{"amount":98.83,"local_amount":247.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":253.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868595,"comment":null},{"amount":99.52,"local_amount":248.8,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":254.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577429,"comment":null},{"amount":106.24,"local_amount":265.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529666,"comment":null},{"amount":109.84,"local_amount":274.61,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":281.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974697,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T10:55:48Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":511957,"name":"Felix Raul","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or F\u00e9lix  de 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es originario de Condega, Municipio de Estel\u00ed, casado, padre de 3 hijos mayores de edad, de oficio comerciante se dedica al negocio de taller de mec\u00e1nico en general, desde hace 13 a\u00f1os, su nivel acad\u00e9mico es hasta primer a\u00f1o de secundaria, F\u00e9lix inicio su actividad laboral  desde muy peque\u00f1o trabajando en un taller de mec\u00e1nica a otras personas, luego fue de haber obtenido experiencia y total dominio en el negocio, decide poner su propio negocio de taller de mec\u00e1nica en general en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, se siente satisfecho con su negocio el cual le ha generado muchas ganancias, en su actividad paga mano de obra , este ha sido su primer negocio, ya que cuenta con el apoyo de su hijo mayor.\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para un manometro y herramientas tales como llaves , gata hidraulica, tuercas etc. El cual ser\u00e1 de ayuda pues con la compra del motor podr\u00e1   entregar su trabajo en tiempo y forma, sus planes futuros es mas tierra para  ampliar el \u00e1rea del negocio  para mayor atracci\u00f3n de los clientes con el objetivo de generar mas ingresos, sus metas pr\u00f3ximas es llegar a comprar mas herramientas para mejorar la infraestructura del negocio, ya que su deseo es tener una mejor vida y poder salir adelante con su familia.\n","en":"F\u00e9lix is 55 years old and is from Condega in the municipality of Estel\u00ed.

She grows potatoes, corn, quinine, and peas, and cares for them with dedication in the evenings\r\n\r\nShe says that during the potato harvesting season, she takes them to the nation\u2019s capital where she can find good buyers and keeps the other vegetables to sell in her own town, where she has steady customers.\r\n\r\nShe has many plans at the moment.  One of them is to build a house of her own and begin saving money for her own farmland.  She is a member of the \u201cPampa Blanca\u201d communal bank and this will be her 9th loan through MFP.  She is happy there and has been working with the association for many years.  The other members are very human and above all have a great desire to help one another.  Antonia will use the money from this loan to buy bird guano (fertilizer) for her next harvest. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1264493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-26T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-25T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":163.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":169.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":176.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":183.37},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":190.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":197.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":206.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":212.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.21,"local_amount":163.02,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573101,"comment":null},{"amount":67.81,"local_amount":169.54,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122743,"comment":null},{"amount":47.84,"local_amount":119.61,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":122.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868568,"comment":null},{"amount":96.04,"local_amount":240.09,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":245.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577400,"comment":null},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":190.71,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529637,"comment":null},{"amount":79,"local_amount":197.5,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":202.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974679,"comment":null},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":206.81,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":211.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996045,"comment":null},{"amount":85.09,"local_amount":212.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:03Z","rounded_local_amount":217.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863679,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T01:43:16Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T15:21:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512008,"name":"Dorys Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dorys Catalina a sus 44 a\u00f1os de edad, casada con dos hijos ambos mayores de edad uno de 21 y otro de 26 a\u00f1os, el de 26 ya no estudia sino que trabaja, la joven de 21 a\u00f1os estudia en 1er a\u00f1o de la universidad, la Sra.

Raquel makes a living selling food and staple household items, such as: rice, sugar, eggs, milk, oil, condiments, beans, flour, etc. She sells her goods out of a small stand that she rents in the central market, and she has been working in the market for the past five years. She has always worked at her stand on her own, and has learned how to work hard to get ahead in life. Raquel begins her daily work routine around 4:00 every morning, and does not arrive back home until 9:00 each night. Even though it was difficult at first, she has become accustomed to this routine.\r\n\r\nRaquel\u2019s favorite aspect of her job is the time she spends with her clients, and she takes great pride in her customer service. She knows that the fruits of her labor go hand in hand with her household needs, and she works very hard so that she can help her husband with household expenses. Raquel feels accomplished and proud of all she has done, and she hopes in the future to open up a larger store with a wider variety of products.\r\n\r\nRaquel is grateful for the support she has received from MFP to make her dreams a reality, and this will be her second loan with the organization. She also appreciates her role as a member of the community bank, as she feels it is a group of responsible, good people.

She is married to Leonardo, who works as a mechanic and they have a seven year old son who they love very much.  They live comfortable in their home.  Gloria sells groceries and has a small store in her home, from where she happily tends to her customers who are mostly her neighbors and who prefer to buy from her.\r\n\r\nShe started this business more than eight years ago out of necessity for additional income.  She used her own money plus a loan to buy her merchandise in small amounts, later growing and increasing her number of customers.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because of the earnings it leaves her and the good results.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to stay at home and not worry about an income.  It also allows her free time that she can use to care for her home.  She doesn\u2019t like when her customers ask for credit; she\u2019s already had bad experience with this type of sales and people not paying.  Now she only sells for cash and she has better results.  She plans to continue growing the business and therefore this will be her second loan through MFP.  She is grateful for the financial support that will allow her to solidify her plans.  She also feels comfortable with her communal bank because she knows the other members and considers them to be responsible and united.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 1,000 PEN to invest in groceries in quantity, looking for the lowest prices to maximize her profits.  She believes that by having a greater amount and variety of goods on hand, her business will continue to be successful and her profits will continue to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1265046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T03:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T03:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":164.83},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165.98},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":182.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":60.23,"local_amount":150.58,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":154.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573131,"comment":null},{"amount":63.57,"local_amount":158.91,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":162.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122773,"comment":null},{"amount":65.93,"local_amount":164.83,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":168.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868596,"comment":null},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":165.98,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":170.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577430,"comment":null},{"amount":70.86,"local_amount":177.16,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":181.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529667,"comment":null},{"amount":73.02,"local_amount":182.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":186.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974698,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-27T06:31:48Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512064,"name":"Loryn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Loryn, 29, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines.

de recursos econ\u00f3micos lo llev\u00f3 a trabajar desde muy chico para poder sustentar sus necesidades. A pesar de tener un trabajo que le demanda mucho tiempo y esfuerzo, \u00e9l no se neg\u00f3 a educar y mantener a su peque\u00f1o hijo que en la actualidad tiene 2 a\u00f1os de edad y que por circunstancias adversas sufri\u00f3 el abandono de su madre. Ahora Carlos vive con su hijo en el Pacto una parroquia del Cant\u00f3n Quito ubicado en la Provincia de Pichincha en la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador. Pacto est\u00e1 ubicado en el noroccidente del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, su historia inicia en la \u00e9poca preincaica y su nombre se deriva de acuerdos realizados entre partidos pol\u00edticos importantes. En cuanto a su econom\u00eda, es una zona agr\u00edcola y ganadera, debido a su situaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica y geogr\u00e1fica, lo cual tambi\u00e9n produce efecto en las cosechas de las cuales se obtiene productos de la Regi\u00f3n Costa como de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra. Su gente vive al d\u00eda a d\u00eda de estas actividades, aunque es un lugar alejado de la ciudad, existen familias que han emprendido en todo tipo de actividades para cubrir sus necesidades y las de su comunidad. \nCarlos hered\u00f3 de sus padres la habilidad para elaborar los ladrillos de panela,  un producto utilizado para endulzar en reemplazo del az\u00facar pero de forma m\u00e1s natural  y saludable que utiliza como materia prima la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y que adem\u00e1s aporta vitaminas al organismo. Carlos dedica a esta actividad desde 8 a 10 horas cada d\u00eda paralelamente con las actividades del hogar que incluyen el cuidado de su peque\u00f1o hijo. Carlos con la experiencia que ha adquirido a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os y experimentando el crecimiento que ha tenido la industria de la ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y sus derivados en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, se siente preparado para dar un paso de crecimiento para lo cual solicita un cr\u00e9dito que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de semillas de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y otros implementos que har\u00e1n que su producci\u00f3n aumente para que Carlos pueda mejorar sus estilo de vida y el de su hijo, d\u00e1ndole la educaci\u00f3n que \u00e9l no tuvo la oportunidad de obtener en su juventud. Adem\u00e1s a Carlos le gustar\u00eda en el futuro comprarse un veh\u00edculo que le permita llegar a m\u00e1s clientes que demandan el producto. Carlos agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa en Ecuador y a Kiva por hacer posible el crecimiento en su vida laboral y personal. ","en":"Carlos, 36, is a single man.  Thanks to his parents' efforts he was able to finish elementary school, but then their lack of financial resources sent him to work at a young age so he could support his needs.  Despite having a job that demands a lot of time and effort, he hasn't neglected raising and supporting his young son who currently is two years old and who, due to adverse circumstances, was abandoned by his mother.\r\n\r\nNow Carlos lives with his son in Pacto, a parish in Quito Canton in the province of Pichincha in the Republic of Ecuador.  Pacto is located in the northwest of the Quito Metropolitan District.  Its history began in the pre-Inca period and its name comes from pacts made between important political parties.  With regard to its economy, it's an agricultural and livestock area because of its climate and geography.  This also affects the harvests, which produce coastal as well as highland crops.  The people there live every day from these activities; although it's far from the city, there are families that have undertaken every type of work to cover their necessities and those of their community.\r\n\r\nCarlos inherited his parents' ability to make bricks of brown sugar, a sweetener that replaces sugar but in a more natural and healthy form that uses sugar cane as its raw material and that also has vitamins.  Carlos spends eight or ten hours a day on this job in addition to the household activities, including caring for his young child.  With the experience he has acquired over the years and the growth in the sugar cane industry in the last few years, he feels ready for growth.\r\n\r\nThis is why Carlos is requesting a loan to buy sugar cane seeds and other implements that will increase his production so he can improve his lifestyle and his son's.  He wants to give his son the education that he himself didn't have to opportunity to get in his youth.\r\n\r\nAlso, Carlos would like to buy himself a vehicle in the future so he can reach more customers who request his product.\r\n\r\nCarlos is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in Ecuador and to Kiva for making possible his business growth and personal growth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1265087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sugar cane seeds and supplies to make brown sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Pacto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-12-27T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-26T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":76.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83.44},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":85.95},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":87.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":90.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":96.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.05},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.1},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":77.33,"local_amount":76.77,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":77.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516835,"comment":null},{"amount":84.05,"local_amount":83.44,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347068690,"comment":null},{"amount":86.58,"local_amount":85.95,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494957,"comment":null},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":85.92,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":86.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524885,"comment":null},{"amount":88.17,"local_amount":87.53,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133189,"comment":null},{"amount":89.1,"local_amount":88.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313730,"comment":null},{"amount":90.68,"local_amount":90.02,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":90.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565336,"comment":null},{"amount":472.54,"local_amount":469.11,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":472.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814381,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-28T04:48:41Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":512068,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Alma.

Es soltero y no tiene hijos. Vive en casa de sus padres, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus 3 hermanos y padres a quienes apoya y quiere mucho. La actividad que realiza Fernando es la de electricista que consiste en realizar arreglos de equipos el\u00e9ctricos, equipos de sonido entre otros. Aprendi\u00f3 este oficio estudiando en un centro de adiestramiento industrial.  Le gust\u00f3 y decidi\u00f3 desarrollar esta funci\u00f3n desde hace 2 a\u00f1os. Viendo que su mano de obra era requerida constantemente empez\u00f3 a comprar los materiales b\u00e1sicos que se necesita para cumplir su labor con mejores resultados. Ahora trabaja con empresas privadas que necesitan de su servicio. Cuenta con la ayuda y complicidad de otro electricista quien le presta algunos equipos el\u00e9ctricos con los que \u00e9l no cuenta por ahora. Lo que le gusta de su actividad es que le ha permitido tener ingresos econ\u00f3micos sustanciales con el cual poder pagar los gastos propios de su hogar y darles una mejor calidad de vida a sus hermanos, lo que no le gusta de su actividad es el riesgo que implica su cumplimiento y tiene que estar hasta muy tarde en las noches para poder terminar y entregar los planos de electrificaci\u00f3n que le piden en las fechas solicitadas. Estas horas de trabajo le han dado algunos malestares de salud, pero eso no lo desanima y sigue adelante. Desea instalar su propio taller de servicio el\u00e9ctrico. Este es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 2 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Por ello agradece la confianza y la ayuda que le brindan para que pueda concretar sus planes. Asimismo, se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas como lo hizo en el cr\u00e9dito anterior. Comenta estar a gusto con su banco comunal pues conoce a sus miembros y los considera personas responsables. Con el pr\u00e9stamo solicitado de 1500 nuevos soles, los invertir\u00e1 en su totalidad comprar herramientas de b\u00e1sicas de electrificaci\u00f3n como pinzas, algunos cables de aislamiento y otros. \n\n","en":"Fernando is 21 years old and is a friendly, enterprising man.  He is single, doesn\u2019t have any children, and lives with his parents and three siblings whom he supports and loves very much.  Fernando is an electrician who repairs electronic and sound equipment among other things.  He learned this trade at an industrial training center and he liked it and decided to develop this function two years ago.  Seeing that his labor was in constant demand, he bought basic supplies to be able to work better.\r\n\r\nNow he works with private companies who need his services.  He has help from another electrician who loans him some electrical tools the he doesn\u2019t have himself.  What he likes about this is that it allows him to have a substantial income with which he can pay his own household expenses and provide a better quality of life for his siblings.  What he doesn\u2019t like is the risk that his commitment exposes him to risk, and that he has to work very late to be able to deliver by the due dates.  These working hours have caused him some health problems but it does not discourage him and he continues ahead.\r\n\r\nHe wants to set up his one electrician\u2019s workshop.

Two of Gulya's children attend school, one is still small and is too young for school.  Gulya has been raising livestock for 8 years as a source of income for her family, having started this business with 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulya's hard work on her farm, today she has 2 dairy cows; her monthly earnings from her holdings are around 15,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.  In order to continue growing her business Gulya turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase 2 cows to fatten and for earnings from the sale of dairy products.  Gulya plans to invest the earnings from the loan into growing her business by building a shed for the animals.
