His wife is a homemaker who looks after their children, and she also sells milk.  Uktam is involved in cattle breeding, and he raises cattle on his own farm.  He also works as a building engineer, but since his salary from that job is not enough to live on, he raises cattle.  Uktam has a few head of cattle on his farm, as well as a dairy cow which gives ten liters of milk a day.  His wife sells milk to the neighbors.

The primary business activities of the members are, for example: food sales, sales of crafts, a grocery store, fuel sales, drinks, fish, meat, fruit, sandals, materials, and much more.\r\n\r\nMabel is a member of the group and her primary economic success has been in the sales of sandals and fruits like pineapple, pawpaw (papaya), grapes, and bananas. She runs a shop where she sells sandals and fruits, from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., at her residence. She buys items from the market and supplies part to her punctual customers and sells part to the nearby customers. It has been 10 years since she began this business, and it is going very well for her, thanks to the effort she puts into her work and the support she received from ID-Ghana through Kiva. At this time, Mabel is in need of a loan of 1,000 Ghana cedis (GHS) to buy enough fruits and sandals to supply to customers. With Christmas approaching, customers are demanding for childrens' sandals for the celebration.\r\n\r\nThe members as a whole are thankful for the opportunity that has been offered and promise to make payments of each of their different loans on schedule as arranged. The group needs a total amount of 9,800 GHS to improve their

She lives in a rural village in Moung Russey district in Battambang province in Cambodia.  She is blessed with one daughter and one son, both of whom are too young for school and still her responsibility. To offer a decent life for her family, Rim has a business farming rice which enables her to earn around 23,000 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nRim has been with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) for three loan cycles already with which she has accomplished improvements to her family\u2019s lifestyle. Now she is in need of money to purchase fertilizer and pesticide, and to cover the cost of labor. Thus, she is leading a loan group of three female members to apply for a loan of 3,800,000 KHR in total.

She has two cows and has produced milk for many years. She started her business by selling goats and sheep at the festival of Eid-ul-Azha, and gradually purchased cows to begin her business of selling milk.  Miraj sells her milk to many of her neighbors, along with butter, cheese and ghee that she makes from the milk. She has a good client list and her business is good enough for her to lead a decent life.\r\n\r\nMiraj is a mother of eight; two daughters and six sons. Her sons also help in her business, while her husband works at a government job.  She is in her sixth loan cycle and has a strong association with the Kashf Foundation.

She buys animals (baby goats and baby cows) at low prices, brings them up and sells them at higher prices.  Her husband also assists her in selling the animals in the local market.  She is supporting her family of four through all her hard work.  \r\n\r\nShe contacted the Kashf Foundation in order to improve her business and to increase her earnings.  Now she is requesting a loan of 20,000 PKR for the purchase of two more goats.  She hopes to grow her business and dreams to give her children a good and high quality education through her efforts in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":224.17,"image":{"id":1241949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase two goats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Raiwind","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.254444 74.217778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2012-12-01T08:21:38Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-31T08:21:38Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasheeda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1415},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1683},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1732},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1888},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1944}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.31,"local_amount":2872,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3100.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331170206,"comment":null},{"amount":16.86,"local_amount":1499,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1618.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339552945,"comment":null},{"amount":17.36,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1665.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347102809,"comment":null},{"amount":17.87,"local_amount":1588,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T14:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355847958,"comment":null},{"amount":18.39,"local_amount":1635,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1765.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364556665,"comment":null},{"amount":18.93,"local_amount":1683,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1816.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372955165,"comment":null},{"amount":39.53,"local_amount":3514,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3793.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390822039,"comment":null},{"amount":20.51,"local_amount":1834,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1979.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.13,"payment_id":410117215,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":1888,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2038.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":419882490,"comment":null},{"amount":21.56,"local_amount":1944,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2098.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.31,"payment_id":429531214,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-02T05:47:53Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T17:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499814,"name":"Parveen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Parveen is a strong and healthy 31-year-old married woman with three children.

She helps her husband to run a grocery store located outside of their home.  When the couple started their relation with Kashf five years ago, their store was small with very few items.  They wanted to increase the range of products but the lack of funds made this almost impossible.  Mussarat borrowed some funds from Kashf in anticipation of business improvement.  Over time, they have added new items to the store and it has become popular in the community.  They want to increase their inventory since the population of their neighborhood has increased in recent years.

There was barely enough left on which to survive.  She says that she arrived at her uncle\u2019s home with a just few pieces of clothing.  That is where she met her husband.

With the money she set up a beauty salon on the ground floor of the house that belongs to her parents.\n\nGabriela's a single mother.

They already have more than 3 years in this trade. They sell the tortillas Monday through Saturday in their home from 5:00 PM to 7:30 PM. It's also worth mentioning that she also plants corn and beans (the trade of her father) but he helps them. It is a family trade and they have more than 15 years of doing it. Today she has the furnishings and equipment necessary to do these activities.\r\n\r\nTo do the work of making and selling the tortillas, she needs to buy (corn, ground pork, cheese, loroco, oil, and vegetables like cabbage, carrots, etc.) these products she purchases in the municipal market that located 2 kilometers from her house. She purchases these products one day a week since they are perishable and do not keep in refrigeration for long.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo (Field Foundation) is to buy 50 lbs of corn, 6 lbs of ground pork, 6 pounds of special cheese, 3 pounds of loroco, 1 gas iron, vegetables like cabbage, carrots, etc. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Iris, is that in the place where she lives it is very big and populated and there is a lot of demand for food in the evening.  For this reason she had the idea of selling hand made tortillas from her home. \r\n\r\nDue to purchase the products for the creation of handmade tortillas so that the sales will be successful, she will be able to obtain increased income. With this income she will be able to give a better life to her young son and stability to her family. \r\n\r\nAs a product of the good investments of credit, she has future plans to construct a small house. Today they live with her parents and she want to be independent, by having her own home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1242463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a 32-year-old married woman with three children, one (a son) of whom is dependent on her and currently in school. Phalla earns her living through farming rice and raising pigs, the businesses in which she has been involved for more than 10 years, earning around 26,000 KHR per day and saving approximately 13,000 KHR after offsetting her daily cost of living. Phalla, a seventh-cycle client with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner), is leading a group member who is just a first-cycle client to apply for a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 KHR each. The previous loans that the group leader, Phalla, already received and successfully paid back have enabled her to send the dependent son to school and improve the family\u2019s livelihood. Now with her requested loan portion, Phalla will buy fertilizer to support her rice field with part of her loan. The rest of her loan will be used to buy pig feed and cover household expenses. Phalla\u2019s hope in the future is that her current businesses, rice growing and pig raising, will run smoothly so that she can boost her income and save some of the profit to keep her son in school.

parallel to her primary and secondary studies.  Her studies ended with high school; unfortunately she was not able to continue with further studies due to a lack of economic resources.  A few years after finishing high school she met her current partner, with whom she has a 3-year-old dependant.  Although they live in one of her mother's houses, their goal is to be independent.  In order to achieve this they are seeking to increase their income.  The family worked together to be able to afford an agricultural plot.  After much effort they succeeded in buying two plots, on which they grow bananas, frying plantains and other crops.  However, in order to keep investing in their crops they need more funds.  For this reason the couple approached CIDRE to request a KIVA loan, and thus be able to increase their crop.
