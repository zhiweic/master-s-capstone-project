Gansukh, 51, is a taxi driver who services the districts of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He lives with his family in a house in ger district, a slum district in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. \r\n\r\nIn winter, he uses a coal fired furnace to heat his home and it emits too much smoke and harmful toxic substances into the air. Therefore, he decided to replace it with a smokeless stove, which is made with modern technology. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters, where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms. Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. In addition, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of main causes of Mongolian air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars on the natural gas.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Mr. Gansukh is taking will be used to cover the cost of the new smokeless stove in his house for reducing the pollution in the air.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children. She said her most difficult challenge is to work in a foreign country. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoy attending church and taking care of her family.\r\n\r\nVioleta is excited to be taking her 11th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business.

is 28 years old. She lives in Akhmeta District with her husband Soso and her 72-year-old father-in-law. Irma requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Irma\u2019s father-in-law and the small income earned by Soso, working as an agricultural worker in the village. It totals 250 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a three-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to restart the family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit Irma will purchase a horse. Soso and Irma will go to the local forest and bring wood from the forest on the horse. They will sell the wood in the village and earn an income.

lives in the coastal region of Kenya with her family; her husband and their five children. Her house is made of cement, but has no piped water; neither does it have electricity. She has a store in her house in which she stocks and sells makuti (thatching materials made from palm fronds). Once she came up with the idea of this business, she gradually made it into a reality thanks to her perseverance and effort. She works by herself every day without a fixed schedule, because she also must care for her family. She feels satisfied with her achievements because she has gotten ahead on her own, and this has helped her to gain the respect of her friends and neighbors who see in her an example to pass on to others. Riziki is requesting a loan to purchase more makuti for her store so that she can increase her sales. She expects to do this without any difficulties, and to continue working without any problems.

She lives in Ouagadougou, where she runs a store selling beauty products, \u201cpagnes\u201d (traditional wrap-around cloth), shoes and, recently, energy products (energy-efficient cookstoves, gas cooking rings, solar-powered lamps). To increase her sales of gas stoves, Gilberte would like to add a gas refill service to her business. In fact, without this service her customers are hesitant to invest in a stove, as they do not know where they can refill their gas bottles, and sometimes have to travel several kilometers in the city to find gas. \r\n\r\nGilberte has requested this loan in addition to a loan she received in July, and she plans to use the money to develop her energy product sales business. This second loan will allow her to buy 25 bottles of gas (five 12-kilo bottles, 15 6-kilo bottles and five 3-kilo bottles), as well as to buy the first gas refill for these 25 bottles. \r\n\r\nThanks to this diversification in her business, Gilberte will be able to increase her sales of gas cooking rings and her income. She will therefore be able to expand her store and buy a freezer, which she will use to sell juices and cold water.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1182446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

49-year-old Isha from the southern area of Torkpoi town in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is widowed with seven children between the ages of 18 years and 30 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Isha established her business within a busy market area. Before her husband died, the couple ran a farm, but after his death she had no one to help her with the farming. So she started a business to generate income to support her family. She works at the business twelve hours per day, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the costs of transportation.\r\n\r\nIsha requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, gari (tapioca) and coal. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her children's health and improve her standard of living. In the future, Isha plans to expand her business more. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1179160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 35 years old and lives in a small village of Tsalka district. He is married and has three children: 12, 15 and 17 years old. They go to the local school. The main source of income for the family is agriculture. In particular, they own four milk cows, 12 calves and sell cheese locally. Also they have a plot of land where potatoes are grown. Part of the harvested product is sold on the local market. \r\n\r\nWith the loan received from Credo, Nugzar plans to repair his cattle-shed and purchase an additional milking cow. He plans to expand the dairy farm through adding additional cows, but the existing cattle-shed doesn\u2019t allow him to implement this plan. Once his cattle-shed is larger, he will expand his animal husbandry business and the family\u2019s income from the sale of dairy products will increase. He will reinvest the additional earnings to expand his agricultural enterprise and make it more profitable.

","en":"Bermet is 53 years old and a widow with 7 children. She has been active in animal and crop farming since 1996, having started her business with 3,000 KGS. Bermet currently has one dairy cow, one bull calf, and 3.0 hectares of irrigated bean and potato fields. Her monthly income from the farm is about 5,000 KGS a month.\r\nThis income has allowed Bermet's children to start their own families. To develop her business further, Bermet has applied to Bai Bushum & Partners for a loan of 50,000 KGS, which she intends to spend on purchasing sheep for fattening and forage.

Beglar requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to re-start his agricultural business, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has a milk cow, dairy products of which are mainly consumed by the family members. Beglar grows greens on a family-owned plot of land. Harvested greens are sold locally. The average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris. It is hardly enough for food for a five member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nBeglar requested a loan from Credo to re-start-up a greenhouse of vegetables; Beglar used to have a greenhouse, but it was old and was destroyed. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Beglar will purchase materials to construct a greenhouse. He will construct it and grow cucumbers, tomatoes and greens during whole year. It will positively impact the income of the family which will increase and will no longer be seasonal as the greenhouse will function all year round.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country\u2019s rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Ivane will purchase seasonal fruits, mainly watermelons and melons, as well as peaches and pears.

Her main challenge is the difficulty of getting the used clothing from the store to the local market where she sells. She started this business with a little amount from her friend and she learned the business from her mother. What she likes about this business is that she is responsible for herself and is proud of herself. She has requested this loan to purchase more used clothing for her business.

He is a retailer, and has a ready-to-wear clothing store in a neighborhood of the capital which he has managed for seven years. His warm welcome, creativity, good clothing advice and experience have enabled him to build up a considerable customer base. \r\n\r\nThe growth of Samuel\u2019s customer base has brought problems, as he cannot meet demand because his capital is so low. This means he has to go and buy stock every weekend on a retail basis, and then return and resell this stock. This does not give him enough profit, and that is why a loan is so important for Samuel, as it will allow him to buy a bundle of clothing and shoes for his store. As a result, he will not only be able to satisfy his customers, but also make more profits. He plans to reinvest these profits in expanding his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1183977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy a bundle of clothing and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bafoussam","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-08-30T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-29T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13837},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14351},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14867},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15379},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15894},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16410},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":16924},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17439},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17954},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18467},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18982},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19496}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.79},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.67,"local_amount":13837,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":14480.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306538,"comment":null},{"amount":28.71,"local_amount":14351,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15018.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914878,"comment":null},{"amount":29.73,"local_amount":14867,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15558.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047112,"comment":null},{"amount":30.76,"local_amount":15379,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":16094.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436907,"comment":null},{"amount":31.79,"local_amount":15894,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16632.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989327,"comment":null},{"amount":32.82,"local_amount":16410,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":17172.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622939,"comment":null},{"amount":33.84,"local_amount":16924,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":17710.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437090,"comment":null},{"amount":34.88,"local_amount":17439,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":18249.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842153,"comment":null},{"amount":35.91,"local_amount":17954,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T08:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":18788.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381610169,"comment":null},{"amount":113.89,"local_amount":56945,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":59592.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390467731,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-31T05:18:22Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":466378,"name":"Lovette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lovette is 32 years old and lives in Jacob Town.

Her loan request was approved in the frame of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

from Sierra Leone! This is 39-year-old Joseph from Moriba Town, in the southern area of Bo. He is married with three children between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. His children attend school. Joseph left school at secondary level and started doing hard labor.\r\n\r\nJoseph runs an electrical appliance store, where he sells extension cords, electrical cable, sockets, lamp holders and bulbs. He has been running this business for ten years. He works at the business 13 hours a day and seven days a week. His other source of income comes from his wife who is a business woman. Joseph says that the main challenge to his business is insufficient capital to expand his business.\r\n\r\nJoseph has requested a loan in order to buy more extension cords, electrical cable, sockets, lamp holders and bulbs. The extra income from this loan will allow him to educate his children and improve his family's welfare. In the future, he plans to open a bigger store. He thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1179400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical

The term \u201cMakarimal Akhlakh\u201d denotes a person has a good heart and does the right thing. Since 2009, the number of group members has reached 300. The goal is to unify group members helping them with their work:  farming, fishing, general retail, import\/export, transportation, industry, crafts, construction, animal husbandry, mining, [fishing], arts and culture, printing and woodwork, public services, sales, processing seafood and produce, retailing spare parts, ice cream production, bakeries and providing various services. The GIE also aims to foster friendship and solidarity among its members so as to help them acquire the material and financial means necessary for their businesses and to take advantage of the benefits afforded by GIE. It is in this spirit that an agreement has been signed between GIE and UIMCEC, to benefit GIE members at the national level. The launching phase uses a sample of 120 active members divided into 12 groups with 10 people in each.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh-group 3 is composed of 10 GIE members who are in the same line of business. They are represented by Mrs. Marietou B.  She is a divorced woman who has been selling fabric, sewing supplies and other miscellaneous items for over 10 years. She starts her work day at 9 AM and finishes at 5 PM. She is a member of UIMCEC and is seeking a credit to replenish her stock by buying fabric and miscellaneous items. The growth of her revenue will allow her to cover the cost of her children\u2019s tuition and also  save money. Her dream is to become a large-scale entrepreneur and travel to   big industrial countries around the world to conduct import-export transactions.

She learned about Milango through a friend who invited her to our group, and she joined with the idea of accessing credit to improve her business operations. The challenges she faces include price fluctuations and inflation. Dama is applying for a loan for 22,000 Kenya shillings to buy vegetables and cooking oil.

Roberto ha recibido hace un a\u00f1o un financiamiento de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual  ha logrado incrementar sus ventas en un 20%, tambi\u00e9n ha logrado invertir en la terminaci\u00f3n de su vivienda y esto lo hace muy feliz. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es abrir un local al p\u00fablico y agregarle adem\u00e1s de sus productos, ranchos, v\u00edveres, y art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar, para finalmente terminar de hacer adecuaciones locativas a su vivienda. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, segundo financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n y con el cual comprara un congelador, para aumentar su capital de trabajo y financiar las ventas  de carnes ofreciendo cr\u00e9dito a sus clientes y ampli\u00e1ndose a un mercado que as\u00ed lo requiere para finalmente lograr aumentar el volumen de sus ventas. Mientras esto ocurre maneja una rotaci\u00f3n de inventarios de 4 d\u00edas y un margen de utilidades del 32%,  indicadores financieros desde donde se proyecta el crecimiento de su negocio. ","en":"Robert at 35 years old, lives in Salgar  <A HREF=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Corregimientos_of_Colombia\" TARGET=\"_new\">corregimiento<\/A> in the town of Puerto Colombia, located on the shores of the sea. Helped by his wife very early every day  to produces fried cheese fingers, Robert then distributes them to 30 stores in the town. His sales generate the earnings he uses to pay household expenses. Once his wife makes them, Roberto distributes them beginning at 5 a.m. on his motorcycle. He also sells beef, pork, fruits and cheese, which are sent to him from a dairy town in the department of Magdalena. He also sells these products to stores and principally to homes in his corregimiento where people know him and he has attracted many customers. \r\n\r\nRoberto received funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo a year ago, with which he succeeded in increasing sales 20%. He also invested in completing his dwelling and this makes him very happy. His future goal is to open a shop to the public and add to it, in addition to his current products, meals, food and items in the typical family shopping basket, so that he can finally finish making on-site adjustments to his house.\r\n\r\nCurrently he is applying for a Kiva loan, his second funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n, and will use it to buy a freezer in order to increase his working capital and finance the sale of meat by offering credit to his customers and expanding a market that needs credit, so that he can finally increase his volume of sales. While this is happening, he is managing a 4 day turnover in his inventory and a profit margin of 32%, the financial indicators from which he projects his business growth.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":736.31,"image":{"id":1175048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her nuclear family consists of just 2, herself and her husband, now that her children work independently.\r\n\r\nHer skill is making artisan hammocks, using Manila cord. Previously, she helped her husband in the business, but since he became bed-ridden some 3 years ago, due to brain cancer, she decided to take on the reigns of the business. She would need to pay for the medicine he required and the chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nRosa reports that her husband continues to be ill, though at times he recuperates, then falls ill again. But she says that with God's help, all is possible and the struggle will continue so long as God allows her to be at her husband's side. Rosa will continue working in her business, since it is the only means she has of covering the costs. She is very grateful to Ceprodel for facilitating a loan that will permit her to buy the primary materials required to fill customer orders.\r\n\r\nThat is why Rosa has visited our offices, to solicit a new loan to buy 3 sacks of thread (specifically those she uses), twists (for hook supports), and 10 beach chair frames (that will also require these materials). She now has her own customers who buy her products from her location in the artisan sector of the market. Rosa can also count on a small post alongside the highway near her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1174196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"buy 3 sacks of

She owns a store where she sells groceries, household staples, and stationery. After 4 years of experience in her family's business, she quickly learned how to operate a business and started her own. She sells from her counter each day for both cash and credit. She opens the doors at 7 a.m. and closes them at 9 p.m. She purchases her merchandise from warehouses in the city of Barranquilla very early and for cash. Her main customers are her neighbors, in particular, the homemakers who purchase small quantities--ounces, quarter or half pounds, or specific weights they request from Shirly--to make the family's daily meals. \r\n\r\nShirly's goal is to have a bigger location in the area and to become a grain dealer. Her great wish is to save so that she is elegible for the government housing subsidy. This is why she proposes to increase her sales. By investing the Kiva loan well, she feels she will gradually reach this goal. Therefore, she will use this first loan to buy groceries, household staple items, and stationery in larger quantities so that she can get discounts from suppliers, can save on her purchases, and be more competitive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1175046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He arrived in the city of Barranquilla looking for a better future ten years ago and started working as a domestic employee.  He then became a helper in a store and used his own savings and a loan he got from his boss to open his own business.  \n\nHis success is due to all the knowledge he\u2019s gotten ever since he was an employee, especially relating to kind service and low prices.  He recently ventured into wholesale sales in other businesses and he\u2019s been very well-received.  His goal now is to start home delivery service in which he also has experience.\n\nDefinitely, Jos\u00e9 is one of those people who despite their poor academic background have \u201ca nose for

competing with low prices and selling at wholesale and

She has been raising livestock and growing produce since 1985, having launched this business with a starting capital of 2,000 KGS. At present, Ainusa\u2019s farm includes three dairy cows, 25 sheep, and 1.2 ha [about 3 acres] of land used for planting corn and potatoes. Her monthly revenues are about 10,000 KGS. Ainusa\u2019s revenues have made it possible for her to buy an old, USSR-manufactured car for her business. In order to grow her business further, Ainusa turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 80,000 intended for the purchase of dairy cows in order to increase her revenues from selling milk and dairy products.

","en":"Nadja is a young 41 year-old woman.  She is a married mother of two daughters.  Nadja is a homemaker, and her husband, Aidi, is involved in private contract work - he is a plumber and a master of all trades.  Their oldest daughter works outside the city limits and supports the family budget.  Of course, these earnings are not sufficient to save for unexpected expenses, and this is why Nadja came to our organization for financial support.

The business is still categorized as a small business as Bernabas only has very limited capital to produce furniture. The limitation in business capital often drove Bernabas to refuse several orders from his customers. He then went to TLM and requested a loan of IDR 3,000,000 to buy wood.

Her sales are based from specialized guides of products or catalogs, which promote products with discounts on certain items. She has 7 years of experience selling beauty products. With the income that comes from her business she has been able to support her family, which is made up of her husband and their three children who are between the ages of 8 and 27 years old. Her business started when a friend enthusiastically showed her the advantages of independent sales. \r\n\r\nThe main items she offers are beauty products, jewelry and clothes, which she sells directly to the consumer, working with a financing system that allows her customers to make payments that take into consideration their financial ability. Ledis maintains relationships with the different suppliers that distribute her products through magazines and a multilevel sales system. She makes cash sales as well as sales on credit. Her business hours are 2pm to 7pm, the rest of her time is occupied by household chores. \r\n\r\nCurrently the special offers that are available in the catalogs include many products with special discounts. Her working capital is not sufficient to buy the amount of products she needs to be able to meet her potential demand for sales and her dream of prosperity. This is the reason she has applied for a loan through Kiva. It is the first loan she has taken out through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

","en":"Freddy is from Granada, he has 9 children, who are all of legal age. He works carrying objects from one place to another for a living. He has been doing this for 24 years. He began in this activity, because it is what his father did for a living, and he inherited the cart with the horse when he was 23 years old. This is his source of income. Formerly, his children helped him, but now that they are all married, he does it on his own, working all over the town, since this is his only source of income. He would like to become well known so that people who need to transport something will hire him. He feels satisfied with the activity he does, that's why he expects to continue with this business for as long as he can. He requests this loan to buy another horse. His goal is to fix his current cart and buy another horse, and hire someone else to do the transportation as well. This kind of service is more affordable for low income people who can't afford to pay for a truck or other vehicles to transport their things.

Shahnaz is currently running a stitching school in her house. She is known around town as the best stitching teacher in town. She has been in business for seven years now and says that these seven years have been a blessing. She provides for her four children who are going to school, because unlike other children in town, their mother is able to pay for their education. \r\n\r\nWhile speaking to Kashf's team, Ms. Shahnaz shared that life was not like this before.

She is engaged, and the mother of three children, two of whom attend school. She is a shopkeeper in a market in the capital where she has been selling fresh food according to the season and charcoal for the last 6 years.
