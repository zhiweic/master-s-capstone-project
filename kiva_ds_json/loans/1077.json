Eman is a married woman from Jabalia. She lives in a simple house with her husband and two sons. Her husband works for a low wage, which is not enough to cover the family's needs. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a 2,517 USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing new living room furniture in order to improve the living conditions in her house. Taking this loan will offer Eman comfortable furniture so she can enjoy living in her house.\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Tingjahat\u2019s only wish is to provide education for all her grandkids, which she failed to accomplish for her kids, due to poor financial conditions of the family. She hopes to get a profit by selling the fully grown pigs and send her grandkids to a good institute.

","en":"Ziyodajon is a very hard-working and determined woman. She began sewing at an early age. After finishing school for the day, she used to sew dresses for girls and women of her village. When she graduated from high school, she was unable to attend university because her parents did not have the financial means to pay for her studies, so she was left without post-secondary education. After getting married, she sewed dresses for her female relatives and in-laws free of charge. As she has completed the course \"Get Ahead\" which was organised by the Association of Businesswomen, she now wants to turn her skills into a business. She will provide sewing services out of her home to local citizens, and her sister-in-law will assist her in running the business. Ziyodajon is seeking a loan of 2,000 US dollars to buy a sewing machine. She is waiting for your kindness.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":1311706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy sewing machine to set up a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ziyodajon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.03,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":0.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364510321,"comment":null},{"amount":0.09,"local_amount":0.09,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":0.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372915607,"comment":null},{"amount":1000.18,"local_amount":1000.18,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381693312,"comment":null},{"amount":999.7,"local_amount":999.7,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":999.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390556114,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T18:46:28Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:58:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537450,"name":"Maha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maha is a 38 year old single lady.

forty two years old, married and has three children.  In order to start providing a source of income for her family, she started a business with livestock.  She began this business with only 5,000 KGS after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

So Valerik has applied for this loan to pay for Gor's university tuition.\r\n\r\nThe loan is very important for Valerik and his family to give Gor an opportunity to complete his education and become a good specialist."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":389.76,"image":{"id":1311930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for university tuition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-03-15T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-14T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerik ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":190000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14442.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":14843.3},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":14825.1},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15354.2},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15509.4},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":15625.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16019},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16165.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":16413},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16689},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16885.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":17228.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.1},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.06},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.73},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.19,"local_amount":14474.3,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":14879.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364630190,"comment":null},{"amount":74.11,"local_amount":29642.1,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":30472.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373026067,"comment":null},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":15427,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":15859.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381815436,"comment":null},{"amount":38.6,"local_amount":15439,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15871.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390674226,"comment":null},{"amount":39.29,"local_amount":15715.3,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16155.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399919920,"comment":null},{"amount":40.24,"local_amount":16096.6,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":16547.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410202902,"comment":null},{"amount":40.56,"local_amount":16222.1,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":16676.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157143,"comment":null},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":16194.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":16648.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308218,"comment":null},{"amount":41.71,"local_amount":16685,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":17152.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845504,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-15T18:05:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537486,"name":"Furaha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Furaha is a very hardworking woman.

It was natural choice to study design. After that I studied jewelry design, which I've practiced since 2003. Making jewelry offers me a sanctuary away from the world where I can do what I want. I love art and three-dimensional pieces, and I love to be able to touch what I create in my mind. To me, my craft is like a magical experience that allows me to express what I feel through silver and gems.\r\n\r\n\"I want to thank those who are helping fund this micro-credit from the bottom of my heart.

She has been doing this work for almost 13 years.

He began his business as a father, to make his family comfortable. His business is located in the outskirts of the city and his main customers are men and women. Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about SLL 400,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000.

She used most of her profits to save, planning to build her house. Now she is requesting a loan for materials to build her house.\r\n\r\nJuana is one of Esperanza Internacional's entrepreneurs. She came to Esperanza Internacional almost five years ago for a loan to expand her business. She joined the group Vecinas Unidas (United Neighbors) in one of the rural villages in Samana, where she has received nine loans to invest in her business. Esperanza Internacional is running a program where most of their clients pay back their loans, fulfill the commitment to expand their businesses, and show fidelity to their groups. They can request loans to improve their houses while running their businesses and attending group meetings.

She hopes to have the capital to continue with the second weeding process that is essential to have a quality harvest in order to get good prices from the buyers. \r\n\r\nHer long term goal is to finish building the second floor of her home and later on, open up a grocery store. For this opportunity, she needs 1,500 nuevos soles to pay the day laborers and proceed with the second weeding process to optimize her final production.

She resides in Kanibadam. She is married and is raising two children. Her spouse works as a private carpenter in town and this is his main income. Muborak herself is engaged in selling women's clothing and bags in the central market. She started this activity two years ago. At first, she could not manage a very big inventory, but after she found out about lending at Arvand she decided to take a loan to increase her inventory. One of her very first loans helped her very much. During the time she was borrowing from Arvand, she acquired her own store.  \r\n\r\nHoping for a brighter future for her children, she works day and night. With the new loan, Muborak plans bring a new range of women's clothing and to expand her business. She is very grateful to Arvand for the financial support and

Oksana has her own business. Oksana has a shop and sells products made from wooden rods. She also deals in wedding decorations for rooms and cars. All that she has, she has achieved on her own. Her husband divorced her because of her inability to have children.

","en":"Nurjamal is fifty two years old, married and the mother of two children.  After the collapse of the USSR, she was given a plot of land.  She is the main source of income for her family and has worked with livestock since 1995.  She began her business with 15,000 KGS and thanks to her hard work and perseverance, today she owns one cow and 1.2 hectares of land where she plants beans, potatoes and strawberries each year.  Her business brings in around 180,000 to 200,000 KGS each month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Nurjamal has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 130,000 KGS to buy one cow.

Also, she wanted to feel like a productive person and support her partner with the household expenses.

married, and has 3 children. The main business of her family is animal husbandry and crop growing. In 2011, she decided to get into the area of fattening and re-selling cattle with a start-up capital of 70,000 Kyrgyzstan som (KGS). Today, her farm consists of 3 dairy cows and 1 horse and brings in a monthly income of 15,000 som. For the purpose of further developing her farm, Sairakan has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 115,000 som to purchase cows. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to invest in future expansion her business.

Her goal in life is to improve her living conditions, to send her children to a good university, and of course to expand her business. She is very kind, sociable, intelligent and energetic. She began her business in 1995 with a start-up capital of only 1,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Today, she has a turnover of 70,000 Som.

Her farm now consists of 6 head of cattle and cash assets of 6,000 Som. In addition to animal husbandry, she grows cotton on a 1.4 hectare plot of land. For the purpose of further developing her business, Anarkhan has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 Som to purchase cows and to plant cotton, corn and clover.

With this extra work, he is building a house and kitchen on his plot of land.  The money from his livestock business helps him with his building work.  As Nurmehamed says himself, \"not all at once, but little by little the sale of each sheep helps the building project and I hope that soon I can finish the bedroom and kitchen for my wife.\"  At the moment, Nurmehamed needs extra money.  He wants to buy small lambs and feed for them.  With this goal in mind, he has turned to Arvand and he hopes that he will find support and the resolution to his problems."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325.1,"image":{"id":1312038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T09:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T09:50:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" \u041d\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":325.1},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":332.87},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":342.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325.1},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":332.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325.1,"local_amount":325.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":325.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774270,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-19T04:01:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":537828,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is 46 years old and married with five children, one of whom is in school.

Hence, she has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a 110,000 som loan to purchase an assortment of clothing. She plans to invest the income from the loan in improving her family's standard of living. She dreams of having her own children.

","en":"Aigul is a 37-year-old wife and mother of four. She has worked in a bakery for many years, but she cannot feed her family on this income alone. Hence, she has also worked in crop farming for 15 years. Her initial investment in this business was 15,000 som. Thanks to persistent work Aigul is able to rent a 3 hectare plot of land where she plants beans.

He usually gains about PHP 5,000 each month and he wants to keep improving transport services and earn more income. For this, he is now asking for a loan of PHP 6,000 to buy crude oil and maintain his motorcycle. This will help improve the safety of all his passengers. \r\n\r\nSomeday, Alberto hopes to generate enough income to have savings for emergencies.

In his free time he enjoys spending time on his small plot of land and sometimes he cooks a tasty barbecue to share with his family.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Luis works as a driver, providing a taxi service in his town. He works every day for about ten hours and thinks that it is going well because he knows the areas where there is high customer demand.\r\n\r\nLuis is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to the provided help he can do general maintenance, painting and buying tires for his vehicle, so he can continue serving his customers, and so he can continue working and striving towards his big dream of moving ahead growing pecans on his small plot of land.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":781.17,"image":{"id":1313045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

Ella tiene grado de educaci\u00f3n de primaria completo pero por falta de apoyo econ\u00f3mico ella no pudo seguir estudiando ya que sus padres son de bajos recursos econ\u00f3micos y lo que ellos produc\u00edan lo lograban distribuir sabiamente para que ella pudiese aprovechar a sacar la primaria completa.

She is hardworking and enterprising. Marta completed her primary school education but she couldn\u2019t afford to continue her studies since her parents are poor. Whatever they produced, they managed to use wisely so she did complete primary school. \r\n\r\nAs a young girl Marta learned about growing coffee from her parents who taught her how to look after the land. Now she and her husband work as coffee farmers; he is the only person who helps her with weeding, pruning, and fertilizing, so they don\u2019t pay any labourers. Marta has been a farmer for more than five years. The land they work is their own as they inherited it from her husband\u2019s parents. It\u2019s located about two kilometres from their house, and they walk there every day.\r\n\r\nNow Marta is seeking a loan to buy fertilizer and manure for the coffee plants as the product they use is expensive and difficult to acquire. Her goal is to have her fields produce more and keep the plants healthy so that she can earn more money. Then she will be able to reinvest in the coffee fields; this is the only means she has of earning money to support her family.\r\n\r\nMarta\u2019s dream is to see her children graduate from university so that they can have a better standard of living, more income, and benefit from the effort that their parents put in today on the land. This is the land that they will one day inherit and can use to create companies and businesses to generate employment for others.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":1312225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy fertilizer and manure for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T15:40:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":14500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1475,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":29251.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390787287,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T17:33:25Z","paid_date":"2013-08-18T10:01:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538580,"name":"Martine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"martine est une m\u00e8re au foyer qui \u00e9l\u00e8ve seule ses enfants;pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ceux de sa famille,elle s'est lanc\u00e9e dans la commercialisation du credit de communication.par ailleurs,elle vend \u00e9galement des friandises ( bonbons,biscuits,etc....).so\u00e0n activit\u00e9 se d\u00e9roule bien,mais elle sollicite n\u00e9anmoins un credit chez nous qui va lui permettre d'augmenter son stock de marchandises et de credit de communication.les benefices g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s seront utilis\u00e9s pour l'achat d'un contenaire afin de rendre plus confortable son point de vente et \u00e9galement pour ameliorer les conditions de vie de ses enfants.","en":"Martine is a housewife who raises her children alone.

She has two children, one of whom is an adult and has an independent life and the other lives under her care and is a student.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores is single and has given her children education and support, thanks to her daily work and efforts. Currently she lives with her younger son in the parish of Chig\u00fcilpe, some 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, the capital city of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a place that has an active trade as it has become a land port of exchange between the mountain ranges and the coast of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThis parish has several houses of cement and of wood mixed with cement. It has a much visited river where tourists and residents practice various sports and they have the opportunity of getting to know the culture of Ts\u00e1chila through legends related to visitors at campfires. Santo Domingo is the third most populous city of the region, and also contributes in the areas of agriculture, livestock, fishing and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dolores took advantage of her talent for preparing delicious typical food, and opened a food stand outside her home 14 years ago. Many of her customers recommend her in the neighborhood, as the flavors are delicious and all of her dishes, stuffed potato patties served with peanut sauce, slow roasted pork, and grilled beef tripes, etc., are greatly desired dishes all over Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThis woman has had problems with her stove. She has been working for many years every day from the early hours of morning until after the sun goes down, and she has maintained it, but all the same, she believes that everything would be better with a new stove.\r\n\r\nWhen she wanted to go ahead with the work, she could not find easy financing, as there are many hoops to jump through in order to be granted credit. In this search she found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who with the help of Kiva could grant her a loan which will be part of the growth of her business and so Mar\u00eda Dolores enriches her quality of life and that of her daughter. Upon hearing about Kiva\u2019s methodology she expressed her thankfulness and sent many greetings and blessings to people around the world making dreams possible for so many micro-entrepreneurs like her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1313029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a new industrial gas stove for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-16T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-15T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":516.8,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.17,"local_amount":78.92,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494997,"comment":null},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":84.37,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:09Z","rounded_local_amount":85.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133230,"comment":null},{"amount":87.12,"local_amount":85.76,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":87.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313769,"comment":null},{"amount":89.01,"local_amount":87.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565374,"comment":null},{"amount":123.8,"local_amount":121.87,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":123.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814414,"comment":null},{"amount":59.19,"local_amount":58.26,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":59.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320588,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-16T18:37:10Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":538544,"name":"Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Javier es casado y tiene dos hijos, uno de ellos est\u00e1 en edad escolar, viven en casa de los suegros de Javier, la casa se encuentra ubicada en la zona Rio Seco  de la ciudad de El Alto.\nJavier estudi\u00f3 hasta el nivel secundario, y con  su esposa se dedican al armado de shorts deportivos, ellos reciben  cada semana ciertas cantidades de telas para su respectivo armado.\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo requiere para  adquirir una maquina cortadora para acelerar su trabajo.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Javier es equipar su taller de costura con m\u00e1s maquinas y convertirse en un microempresario.\nEs la segunda vez que solicita cr\u00e9dito junto a IMPRO y la primera vez con KIVA.\n","en":"Javier is married and has two children.

She is the main source of income for her family.  Since 1995, she has worked with livestock, having started her business with 10,000 KGS.
