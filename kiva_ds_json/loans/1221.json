Maclellan has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Albert, Hellen, Rebeccah, and Agripinah.\n\nJivuye A village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser.  Maclellan believes that the dispenser will help to kill bugs in drinking water. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Maclellan\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1438385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To improve health and productivity by increasing access to safe drinking water through chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-09-25T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-25T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maclellan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeccah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripinah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-25T18:19:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":612038,"name":"Beatrice's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Mulundu village in Kenya, Beatrice has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser.

She lives in a house with mud walls, a concrete floor, and an iron roof house with her grandchild. Beatrice works as a maize and beans farmer and is an active member in her community, especially the women's group.\n\nMulundu village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from a protected spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Beatrice and the 25 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nBeatrice has volunteered to act as the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. She volunteered to be the promoter to assist the community to grow and to help prevent water-borne diseases. Someone in Beatrice's family has suffered from water-borne diseases in the past and she wants to prevent this from happening again in the future.

Her major business challenges are seasonality and holidays, because her customers are mainly university students.\r\n\r\nAgatha aspires to see her business grow into a retail shop and also to build her own house so as to stop renting.  She resides in  a rented house; the family has access to electricity and piped water. Her monthly expenses include school fees and rent.

He lives with his parents and grandmother in a small village in Khulo district. His grandmother is provided with a retirement pension. The family has a cow. Gocha's mother milks the cow every day and produces cheese to sell. They also have a plot of agricultural land, where maize and walnut trees are grown. They always have high-quality products, which are sold to local retailers. Along with these agricultural businesses, Gocha decided to start a transportation business. He sought a loan, but the local credit providers usually demand experience and some stable income from the borrowers. His credit requests were rejected several times, as he was unable to satisfy their requirements.

He is 48 years old. He is a married man. He has four children: two sons who are 10 and 19 years old and two daughters who are 16 and 20 years old. His wife and daughters are homemakers and his sons go to school. For twelve years, Rustam has worked as a cook preparing ethnic dishes. He mainly cooks delicious Tajik plov (a Central Asian rice dish). In his free time off from work, Rustam decided to start doing animal husbandry, along with his job as a chef. The idea for two simultaneous jobs came from his brother, who has bought and sold livestock for several years now. He will help Rustam in the beginning, so that Rustam can easily start his own business. Rustam is taking out a loan to buy two calves, three cows and a bull-calf in order to start raising cattle at home.

This loan is very helpful and very useful for me; that\u2019s why I want to say thank you a lot for this program and all of the lenders.\nIn the picture, Neffa and her mother,

Three of them are dependents. She lives in her home, located in a neighborhood of San Lorenzo, in southern Honduras, where she sells merchandise with the help of a daughter. Clisanta sells used clothing for children and adults. In addition to selling out of her home, she also goes out to sell in various areas of San Lorenzo. Clisanta is asking for the loan to buy bundles of American clothing like blouses, pants, dresses, shirts, swim trunks, etc., as well has low-cost plastic knickknacks since she wants to expand her business.

He has lived his whole life in the countryside, where he learned all the tasks related to agriculture and livestock, thanks to his father's teachings.  Now he makes his living raising cattle for milk production, and the milk that he gets is sold in the market.  In this way, he generates the necessary income to cover the basic needs of his home.\r\n\r\nThe client is a sensible, disciplined and hardworking man.  In spite of adversities, he always looks for options that allow him to get ahead.  This is why he is applying for a loan to invest in the purchase of agricultural inputs (compost and fertilizers) necessary to fertilize the grass where the cattle feed.

has always had the entrepreneurial spirit. He is happy, outgoing, and has an infectious smile. So when Alexis found himself unemployed last year he decided to start a business for himself. Why depend on more short term work when he could follow his dream of running a small business, and create employment for others while doing it?\n\nThe primary means of transportation for most Rwandese is the matatu, a mini-bus taxi that is often overcrowded and overloaded with cargo. Most of these buses are very old, and with a lack of proper maintenance and second-hand parts, they are very dangerous on Rwanda's curvy, hilly roads.  Alexis saw that the cost of repairs deters owners from properly maintaining their matatus, and set his sights on finding a way to make the repairs more affordable and, in turn, the buses safer.\nEarlier this year, Alexis started an auto shop to provide repairs and spare parts to the bus companies. In addition, he has partnered with a local vocational school to hire graduates from its auto repair program. With Alexis these students will receive a full time job\u2014rather than a low-paid apprenticeship\u2014and will provide Alexis with highly skilled technicians.\n\nRight now, Alexis's business is small, but he has finally secured a deal with his first large-scale client to provide spare parts for their entire fleet of buses. This $10,000 loan will give him the working capital to service this client and hire two auto repair students from the next graduating class, giving Alexis the capacity and credibility he needs to bring in other big clients and grown his business in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":1439637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"To hire two employees and secure a new large-scale client.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":319,"posted_date":"2013-09-25T21:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-25T21:00:20Z","loan_amount":10000,"lender_count":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":10000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10000,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-04T10:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429411708,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T02:43:37Z","paid_date":"2014-01-04T10:06:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":609300,"name":"Alimamy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 31-year-old Alimamy.

She is a trader who sells fresh seasonal produce (tomatoes, carrots and cabbages). She has been working in the marketplace for three years old. She has a solid understanding of her suppliers, as well as the customers she has served over time thanks to her experience in this area. But she constantly finds herself running out of produce.

She tells us that for a year she has been making a living selling chickens as a street vendor in the Los Cux hamlet.  On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays Liria does not go out to sell chickens but works washing and ironing clothes.  Liria is applying for this loan because she needs to buy chickens on credit.  The lorry that comes round selling the chickens sells on credit but, on many occasion, the chickens have been injured and die.  So, Liria prefers to buy on credit and can choose which ones she takes and make sure that they have not been injured.  Liria also wants to help her children, who are studying, including one who is working for his degree, which costs more.

It is made up of four ladies who work together in different areas in Sana`a, Yemen. This is a group of women with initiative, values and good proposals on how to conduct business nowadays. They requested a loan of 200,000 YER from AMB. \r\n\r\nLinda is 32 years old and a married woman with three children. She is a merchant; specifically she sells new clothes for adults and children, according to the season. She sells her products from her house. She buys her merchandise from distributors and stores where the prices are cheaper. \r\n\r\nShe began this activity as a result of selling her business from home. With the income from her business, she was able to upgrade her home and enjoy more comfort. At the present time, her business doesn't get her as much profit due to the bad situation in Yemen. So she applied for a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB to acquire articles of clothing such as dresses, shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, etc. She will sell them to her customers, thus giving her the opportunity to improve her income from her business. \r\n\r\nOne of her personal dreams is to send her children to private high schools.

Since he was a little boy his mother would take him to take lunch to his father and the other workers. As he grew up his father taught him the work that he did, and in this way he learned well and saw that it was a job with which he could earn money and be successful.

His father also farms, but in order to provide for the rest of the family, he works on his own.\r\n\r\nThe loan he seeks will be used to buy fertilizers, pay laborers, pay the rent on the land he works, 2 liters of herbicide, and 10 pounds of bean seed.

He would like to invest in the purchase of cedar and palo blanco woods for production.\r\n\r\nRoberto has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was 11 years old I walked into a wood workshop and asked the owner to teach me the carver's craft. My desire to learn was very strong, and I was motivated by my ambition to be the best and of course, to help my family. It hasn't been easy to establish myself as a lone artisan, but my wife's support encourages me to constantly renew myself as an artist. I believe it is important to showcase the handcrafted nature of wood carving, and that's why I take time to teach. I don't want to see this art form disappear. I also stress the importance of working with certified woods and being conscious of preserving the environment. In fact, we have participated in reforestation campaigns to ensure green and healthy forests. I am so grateful to the Lord for allowing me to achieve what I wanted. I have a workshop I can leave to my children, I have a good job, and I try to instill in others the example of hard work, will and honesty that my parents taught me.\"\r\n\r\nA message from Roberto: \"Thank you all for the opportunity of this microcredit so I may keep producing. I am working on increasing my stock and developing new designs to generate more sales.

For knotting carpets, different kinds of natural and synthetic fibers are used, namely, wool, cotton, jute, and viscose. Carpets are woven by hand on a structure called a loom. There is no better kind of the carpet than a carpet made by hand, though this is far from implying that all hand-tufted carpets are superior to all machine-made ones. Traditionally, carpets are woven on wooden looms. The carpet is generally woven in a warp, i.e., a chain of vertical threads, fixed almost vertically in front of the weaver.\r\n\r\nHer husband is very expert and knots very fine carpets. This is a very slow and time-consuming procedure; he knots carpets over nights. This is the reason her husband can sell at a high price, but the problem is that the customers do not always agree over the demanded cost. The demand for fine carpets has been increasing from time to time.\r\n\r\nHer husband wants to buy more raw material for knotting carpets, but he does not have enough savings to make this purchase possible. Therefore Rubi has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can buy raw materials, such as polyester, wool, cotton, jute, and viscose fibers for knotting carpets.

This is a place known for its busy commerce, its traditional fiestas of San Pedro and San Pablo, and the cheerfulness of its people. \r\n\r\nThis is where Rosa lives. She is 34 years old and in a common-law relationship from which she has three children, ages 17,12 and 8. Two of her children  go to high school and youngest goes to primary school. Her husband works as a construction helper.\r\n\r\n12 years ago, seeing that her husband did not earn much in his job and that his job was not secure, Rosa told him to build her a small shed in which she began to raise chickens. Over time she has expanded her chicken operation and currently has up to 400 chickens per season. The season lasts two months, by the end of which time the chickens are ready for sale.

Having a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

This will be supplemented by the sale of carbon credits, which the school will generate from using the water tank.

Munkhzul is 33 years old and lives with her two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

She has been working as an assistant cook at a kindergarten for the last two years. Her elder daughter goes to high school while her youngest attends kindergarten. This summer, she began to renovate their house but due to lack of finances, she couldn't finish it in time. So she is requesting a loan of 4,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as bricks, cement, fiberglass and foam. After making repair and insulation using those materials, her family will be able to live in a comfortable and warm place without worrying about the upcoming winter. Also, the family will burn less coal for heating because of insulated walls thus, releasing less pollution into the atmosphere.
