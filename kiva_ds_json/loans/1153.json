","en":"Guadalupe is 61 years old, married, and has four children.  She has been working for approximately 40 years to provide for their family, with the help of her husband.  Guadalupe makes tamales and bread to sell and also has a mill for grinding boiled corn which has one hopper.  Her husband used to work as a builder in the area.  He also worked as a farm laborer when building work was scarce.  Together with her family, Guadalupe also cares for 5 head of cattle and grows sorghum over 0.7 hectares in order to provide fodder for their cattle and grain for their farmyard birds.  She also grows corn over 1.4 hectares which is used for her family's own consumption and, if the price is right, she sells some in order to cover some household expenses and the cost of cattle fodder.  The area in which she lives has two well defined seasons: a rainy season when she grows basic grains and fodder for the cattle and a dry season when pasture is scarce and dried out.  There is no natural water source for filling water troughs or watering crops.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe buys her farm supplies in the city.  She has to catch the only bus that services her community or travel by pick-up truck for 15 kilometers.  Then she has to carry her products on her back until she reaches her farmland with her family and whoever else she hires to do this work because her husband is no longer able to work for health reasons.  Fifteen years ago he suffered an accident on a construction site which left him in a coma.  He lost a large part of his reasoning ability as well as his ability to carry out heavy labor.  Guadalupe is practically the only one who provides income for their household.\r\n\r\nGuadalupe will use the loan that she is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides and seeds.  She will also pay laborers to farm 0.7 hectares of sorghum and 1.4 hectares of corn.  This loan will allow her to meet the need her family and farmyard birds have for basic grains and provide her cattle with fodder during the dry season.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Guadalupe hopes to be able to work differently, perhaps with her own capital.  She would like to improve her cattle.  The cows that she has right now are bred for their meat.  By crossing them with a dairy bull she could obtain animals that adapt well to the local climate and produce more milk.  This would make more income for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1378384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides and seeds, and to pay laborers to farm 0.7 hectares of sorghum and 1.4 hectares of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T11:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":81.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":85.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":98.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.32,"local_amount":75.32,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":75.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390801851,"comment":null},{"amount":81.07,"local_amount":81.07,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":81.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814930,"comment":null},{"amount":77.87,"local_amount":77.87,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":77.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090767,"comment":null},{"amount":75.93,"local_amount":75.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856761,"comment":null},{"amount":82.47,"local_amount":82.47,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":82.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505044,"comment":null},{"amount":607.34,"local_amount":607.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":607.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T22:06:13Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T11:33:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":576698,"name":"Jehova Es Mi Roca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo est\u00e1 formado por tres socias emprendedoras una de ellas es Charlotte mujer de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, acompa\u00f1ada con dos hijos , su negocio es ser costurera y vender cosm\u00e9ticos de la Avon desde hace 15 a\u00f1os en su comunidad ya que es muy reconocida, este cr\u00e9dito lo quiere invertir en la compra de cosm\u00e9ticos como cremas faciales, cremas para manos, cremas para pies, cremas para cuerpos, delineadores, m\u00e1scaras, pinturas de labios, pinturas de u\u00f1as, perfumen de var\u00f3n, perfumen de damas, colonias para despu\u00e9s de afeitar, lociones para hombre etc.Yahaira es una mujer que tiene 34 a\u00f1os y su negocio es la venta de cajetas y Rafaela tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y su negocio es tener una pulper\u00eda.","en":"This group has three entrepreneurial members.

She lives with her husband and 3 children, whom she loves very much, in the house which she inherited from her mother.  She has worked for many years selling fruit and food on a casual basis, when each fruit is in season.  When there is a glut of citrus fruits, she sells them in the mountains and, as they are very rare in that area, sales are good and she increases her earnings.  She also says that, during holiday periods, she sells food in various town squares around the area, which also provides additional income. She now hopes to buy a large amount of fruit with the capital obtained, but fruit is scarce this year and she has to increase the selling price of her goods.  This is her first loan with KIVA. She is grateful for the help, as it will enable her to make progress with her business and improve her income.  Furthermore, she promises to make her repayments punctually.  Margarita will invest the S\/.1500 soles in the purchase of  a variety of fruit for her business.

Using those materials, her husband will repair and insulate their old house.

It comprises four women who know one another through ties of kinship and community. The women average 40 years of age and are married mothers of six children. They have different businesses, such as trading in condiments and vegetables, just like MARIAM, who is the first person in the photo standing from the left. The women live in large traditional families in N\u2019TENTOU, in the sub-prefecture of Ouelessebougou (R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro, Republic of Mali). They have been working in small-scale commerce for several years and are in high demand for their businesses. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying the growing needs of their customers, the group members decided to join the loan program at the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. They are on their fifth solidarity loan. \r\n\r\nMARIAM, the group's president, is well-known in N\u2019TENTOU and excels at selling vegetables condiments. She intends to use her loan to purchase different kind of condiments (black pepper, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, oil, salt, tomato paste). She gets her supplies from Bamako and locally from wholesalers. And she resells her goods in OUELESSEBOUGOU for cash or on credit to a customer base composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to make a monthly profit of 25,000 francs CFA that will enable her to repay the loan and reinvest in her business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1379696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase condiments, such as onions, cabbage, salt, and tomato paste to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Tentou ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":240,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":120472.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678694,"comment":null},{"amount":240,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120472.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924307,"comment":null},{"amount":240,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":120472.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207498,"comment":null},{"amount":240,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":120472.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972171,"comment":null},{"amount":240,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":120472.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T00:33:57Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575522,"name":"Ram's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Living in a village located in Srey Snom district of Siem Reap Province, Ram is a 35-year-old mother and blessed with three kids; two of them are still in school.

For this, he borrows the bajaji from a private company which he has to pay approximately 280 USD each month. This amount equals 45% of his total income.\n\nOne month ago Zawadi also started his own social business with solar energy. With the help of African Solar Rise, he wrote a business plan and started selling solar products to his passengers. Furthermore, he developed the idea of his own \"Solar Bajaji Project\": to create awareness about solar energy he wants to equip his own bajaji with solar products so that his passengers can experience this ecological energy solution during their ride through Dar es Salaam. With a Kiva loan we can make this project come true, and Zawadi can buy his own bajaji to equip it with solar products.\n\nDue to his organisational skills, the repayment of the loan won't be any problem for Zawadi.

He is a businessman involved in the buying and selling of a local brew commonly known as waragi. He has many customers for the commodity because it's easily affordable for the residents. He has been operating this business since 2002 and it is his major source of income for looking after the family. \r\n\r\nHe supplements his income by practicing agriculture, but on a smaller scale.

","en":"Guilber is a very modest person, with limited economic resources. He is single and lives with his parents, sharing the expenses and responsibilities of the household. Guilber's main activity is the growing of beans and peanuts. In the current farming season, he suffered a decrease in production due to early frost which affected the ripening process. As a result, Guilber has had a loss of revenue which he had planned to invest in the purchase of young bulls. Nevertheless, Guilber still wants to buy the livestock. This is why he is asking for a loan, which will help him a lot. He says that raising the cattle will provide him with an added value, because he will have animal drawn traction for his personal use and to rent out. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":483.38,"image":{"id":1378981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy four young bulls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":483.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":483.38,"local_amount":3333.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3340,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419833261,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-26T10:02:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577103,"name":"Valentin Celedonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"VALENTIN  tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad es casado tiene dos hijos, vive con la esposa y con los hijos en la ciudad de Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\n\nEs Integrante de la VRC GENESIS, se encuentra ubicada en el recinto atascoso, Pertenece al Cant\u00f3n ventanas se dedican a labores agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias.\n\nVALENTIN se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, adem\u00e1s se dedica a la crianza de patos y pollos.

He always dreamed of being educated, but financial issues stopped him from pursuing that goal, so he is now raising animals. However, he does like his work because he receives a good income from it. Since Faiziev has two children he is doing everything he can to provide them with all they need. He dreams that his children will study in the best educational institutions and work in their chosen specialties. Currently Faiziev is planning to expand his herd and wants to buy more livestock. He recently learned from friends about the organization Arvand and decided to apply for a loan, since he does not have enough cash to buy the animals.

He is married and has four wonderful children. He and his family live in a rural town. The children attend the local school and Najmiddin and his wife try to do everything possible to ensure that they are well educated and prepared for the future. Najmiddin started his own business because he wanted a steady income. Now it has already been 18 years since he started raising animals to sell. He has a field near his home where the livestock can graze. His wife also helps him. She cares for the animals and milks the cows. Najmiddin himself also works in the local hospital, which provides additional income. But the more predictable and stable income comes from selling livestock. The house where Najmiddin and his family lives feels too small, since the children are growing and need more room.

","en":"Shakar is a wonderful older woman. She is married and has three grown children. Shakar has had a good married life: her husband understands her and helps with everything. Shakar is an active woman: she always likes to have something to do. People even call her a town activist. She works in the school as a janitor, which earns her additional income. She also spends a lot of time helping her children raise their children. But she has her own business which earns her a stable income to cover living expenses: she raises livestock. Right now she has two animals. The business brings her a good profit, which covers food, but not enough for the other needs of the family. For example, Shakar's house is in bad shape and needs major repairs, but they don't yet have the financial resources to pay for them. Shakar herself dreams of building a large house with good living conditions where she could live with her children and grandchildren. But to do that she will need to increase her income so that she can save for construction. This is why Shakar wants a loan: so that she can buy several head of livestock to expand her business and save the resulting income for construction of a new house. She hopes for your support and thanks you in advance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1377892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shakar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":84.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":87.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":99.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.13},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.72},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.32},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.59},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.51,"local_amount":68.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":73.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616149,"comment":null},{"amount":16.03,"local_amount":71.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":76.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860019,"comment":null},{"amount":16.58,"local_amount":73.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":78.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136764,"comment":null},{"amount":17.13,"local_amount":76.17,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900960,"comment":null},{"amount":17.72,"local_amount":78.75,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550142,"comment":null},{"amount":142.03,"local_amount":631.23,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":676.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T18:09:02Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577120,"name":"Ruben","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruben de 56 a\u00f1os de edad  es un hombre  muy responsable con sus obligaciones de hogar, ya que siempre se ha caracterizado por brindarle lo mejor a su familia.

For the last three months, he has had around $60\/day in sales on average (just mobile phone airtime credit sales). \r\n\r\nAs the business continues, he hopes to get a Kiva loan as a working capital loan in order to do more transactions on weekends.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":214.2,"image":{"id":1376603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bogor Selatan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-27T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-27T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.8,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pangestu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":214.2,"local_amount":2000000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2233068.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.8,"payment_id":419961858,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T13:53:42Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T20:26:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577138,"name":"Ana Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nAna tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene dos hijos.

She has been farming since she was a young girl.  At the age of 12 her dad would take her along with him when he went out to farm.  She says that he told her \"it will help you when you have your own family\".  Now that she does have her own family, it is indeed helping her.  Her farming has allowed her to help her husband.  In addition to this work, Ana also owns a small store which she is working hard to stock because the farm work is becoming very tiring.  For this reason, her dream is to have a well-established store.  Ana gets up very early, at 5.00am, to prepare her husband's breakfast as she has never liked him to go out without his morning coffee.\r\n\r\nAna sometimes buys the materials that she needs for her farm work in the city.  To catch the bus to the city she has to first walk for 30 minutes.  If she doesn't catch a motorcycle taxi it is a long journey.\r\n\r\nAna is requesting this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy a bag of seed, two gallons of herbicides, 11 sacks of fertilizer and two liters of pesticides.  Through this investment, she will buy the supplies she needs for her crops as winter has already begun and her corn fields need fertilizing.\r\n\r\nAna would like to expand her small store as the farm work is becoming very tiring as she grows older.

So she wants to increase this to help her family have a higher income.\r\n\r\nWorking capital loans to Ruma agents allow them to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions. Each Ruma agent has a balance with Ruma that allows them to sell mobile phone credit or process bill payments.

When the balance is at zero, the agent cannot process any additional sales or bill payments and has to top up their balance by giving Ruma field officers cash in exchange for electronic credit.  \r\n\r\nFor operational efficiency, Ruma can collect from agents only as frequently as once a day and cannot collect on the weekend when banks are closed, and cash can't be safely deposited there. As a result, agents often have lower sales on the weekend and have unfulfilled potential to make more transactions during weekdays when their balances are empty.  \r\n\r\nThis working capital loan allows credit-worthy borrowers to reach their full sales potential. The loan is structured like a line of credit that the borrower uses and repays as needed during the loan term. At the end of the term, the borrower is responsible for paying back any outstanding balance so that the total amount can be returned to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":253.46,"image":{"id":1376637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to process more mobile phone credit sales and bill payment transactions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Serang","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":219,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chara","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":253.46,"local_amount":2500000,"processed_date":"2013-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2729306.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":439841519,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-30T14:08:35Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T14:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":577169,"name":"San Jose Obrero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 \u201cSan Jose Obrero\u201d se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed, una ciudad con dif\u00edcil acceso a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n.

She lives in Lahore, Pakistan. She is a responsible mother of six children. Her husband is a rickshaw driver by profession. For the past many days, his rickshaw has not been working properly and because of this, he is unable to generate any income. He wants to repair it as soon as possible. However due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of repairing the rickshaw. Therefore, Parveen, as a member of a three-person lending group has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of repairing his rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business. Parveen is very thankful for

His father lives with him and has outgrown the age of digging. The son therefore decided to continue with the business to earn income to take care of his family and his aged father, who needs intensive care that suits his old age. \r\n\r\nBoaz therefore applied for a group loan with Bwanda Bakyara Kwetungura Group in order to improve his agricultural business to a standard that can match his requirements through mulching and manuring the tomatoes. The main challenge he is facing now is weather; there is a lot of sunshine which necessitates him to water the tomatoes, thus making it more expensive for him to meet his target of being the chief supplier of Rukungiri district by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1262.82,"image":{"id":1376688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Onesmus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Innocent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mable","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sezi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zabroni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":649999,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":650498.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689683,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":650002,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":650501.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480814,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":649999,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":650498.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879964,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":650499.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983621,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":650001,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":650500.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635731,"comment":null},{"amount":12.82,"local_amount":33333,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":33358.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863180,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-30T15:31:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575663,"name":"Shamshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamshad is a 35-year-old woman.

Several years ago, Ne\u00f3fita was in delicate health and because of this she opened a food store.

She is a good person and very responsible.  She is married and has two children, whom she loves very much.  Cimi is currently living in a rented house, alongside her husband and young ones, and is fighting to move ahead in life.  Cimi mends and makes clothes.  She has a workshop in her home and has been doing this work for sixteen years.  She learned her trade from a young age, when she worked for another woman who was a seamstress.  Little by little, and with a lot of patience, Cimi learned the dressmaking skills and decided to work independently.  Putting the skills she had been taught by her previous employer into practice, Cimi was able to earn her own income.  Now Cimi has a workshop with a business partner.  In the time she has worked in this business, Cimi has always looked for the best way to her job.  On many occasions, pressure from customers has made Cimi feel that she was not going to complete the work efficiently.  However, she has faced her difficulties and now has plans to expand her business, though she knows that the path to this is long and so it is a long-term goal.  At the moment Cimi is preparing to start creating her own designs to sell, as she has orders from customers.  On this occasion, she is applying for 1500 Nuevo Soles and is very excited to learn that there are people who can provide her with financial support to continue developing her business.  Cimi promises to be responsible and make her repayments on time.  Cimi will use the loan to buy material, needles, thread and other supplies for her dressmaking workshop so as to continue with her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1379294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy material, threads, needles and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-06-28T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-28T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":227},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":239.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":238.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":257.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":261.84},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":275.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.83},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.01},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.23,"local_amount":227,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:23:30Z","rounded_local_amount":232.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975897,"comment":null},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":239.53,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":245.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390997279,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":238.63,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":244.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864742,"comment":null},{"amount":94.36,"local_amount":257.36,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":263.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353114,"comment":null},{"amount":96.01,"local_amount":261.84,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":268.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904876,"comment":null},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":275.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":282.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090876,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-28T11:56:12Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575688,"name":"Rakhal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakhal is a 31-year-old married woman and a mother of four children.
