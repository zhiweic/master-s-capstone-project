Ukraine from the Republic of Georgia. As time passed, he met a wonderful woman, married, bought a house and began to farm. He has applied all his strength to trying to make his business more profitable each year. At first he grew vegetables unprotected outside, then built small greenhouses, and they redid them again so that he now has large hoop greenhouses. The organization Hope Ukraine helped Khoren greatly in building the greenhouses. \r\n\r\nKhoren has fantastic helpers: his wife and four children. This year one of his daughters was married, so Khoren wanted to put as much extra work in as he could in order to help the young couple start their life together. He started heating the greenhouses, but it didn't go well. He got low quality, toxicant tubing, which caused his seedlings to die. Still, Khoren did not give up, and is again asking Hope Ukraine for help, so that he can buy a new boiler and  tubing. He very much hopes that this time he will have a good harvest and earn extra income which he can use to help his children.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1464022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a quality greenhouse heating system","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":159,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khoren","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T06:38:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630031,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Antonia trabajo de muy joven en el comercio tanto en la localidad de Santa Cruz como en el tr\u00f3pico de Cochabamba, lamentablemente por problemas de entendimiento con su pareja esta separada, actualmente tiene un dependiente su hija menor que esta estudiando en la ciudad de Santa Cruz, para poder ayudar a su hija  con  los  estudios la se\u00f1ora Antonia trabaja con el comercio de refrigerios ofreciendo este servicio en su casa y tambi\u00e9n vendiendo de ambulante en la calle, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os a tenido algunos inconvenientes por su salud que no le a permitido tener capital para mejorar sus servicios, por esta raz\u00f3n solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de  una heladera que le permita mejorar  los  servicios de refrigerios y la venta de jugos  tropicales, de esta forma seguir\u00e1 colaborando con los estudios de  su  hija que aun le falta culminar el ultimo a\u00f1o.","en":"Since she was very young, Antonia has had businesses both in Santa Cruz and in the tropics of Cochabamba.

cucumbers. In the courtyard, he has a beautiful house with impressive cleanliness and order. \r\n\r\nLast fall, thanks to a loan from Kiva, Sergei installed a heating system and greenhouses, and was very happy with them. In March, he planted cucumbers and spent night and day heating the greenhouses. He was expecting a successful harvest, but over time he noticed that the plants were not growing actively. He measured the temperature, and it turned out that the soil was not warm enough. Sergei was concerned because cucumbers are heat-loving plants, so he began to investigate the problem. He discovered that the heating pipes had leaks, and thus were half empty. Sergei was disappointed; the harvest began much later and he lost profit.\r\n\r\nNow Sergei is requesting a loan of 40,000 UAH in order to buy new, quality hoses, as well as coal for heating. Sergei is hoping that next year, everything will work correctly -- after all, he loves order!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1464046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy new hoses and coal for heating greenhouses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-11T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-10T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":4900,"lender_count":145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T16:38:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630138,"name":"Neng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neng, 40, is a resident from the Samrong district of Takeo Province.

Vodyanoye, in Ukraine.  For many years already, he has been growing vegetables such as radishes, tomatoes, zucchini and parsley on his plot of land.  His hardworking wife and daughter help him run the business.  Alexander is a good farmer and he loves his work.  Next to his house, he has created a beautiful courtyard with a paved driveway, a new vineyard, and a gazebo where it is nice to relax, in the shade, in the summer.\r\n\r\nEverything is in order on Alexander's property.  He has built seven greenhouses in which he manages to sow crops and get a harvest three times per year.  Alexander is very serious about his business.  Whenever he learns something new, he tries to apply it to the business.  This year, he wants to install a heating system inside his greenhouses, as he has seen how profitable it has been for many of his friends to install heating systems in their own greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAlexander is requesting a loan of 40,000 hryvnia.  He is ready to start a new season in well-heated greenhouses.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Alexander is featured with his

In the past, Lubov worked in the garden with her husband, but he is now handicapped with spine problems and can only move with the aid of crutches. Lubov worries a lot about her husband and it was very difficult for her to continue with her business, but she now gets help from her son and they work together.\r\n\r\nThanks to previous Kiva loans, Lubov and her son built and equipped two greenhouses. There is enough space on her land for one more greenhouse. To avoid losing a year, Lubov decided to request a loan of 20,000 UAH and build the additional greenhouse.\r\n\r\nLubov loves her three children.

In addition to her responsibilities at school, Fridda currently works 40 hours a week and earns $11 a day. With a career in economics, she expects to earn $20 a day, a substantial increase from before.

It is just 10 minutes from the city of Portoviejo, which is the capital of the Manabi province of Ecuador.  It is full of history and is the place where the members of the Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n communal bank meet every 2 weeks.  This is also where Deisy lives.  Deisy is 49 years old, separated, and has 3 children of ages 24, 19, and 18.  The youngest two live with her still and are college students.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a great mother to her children (having to earn a living for herself after separating from her husband), Deisy has an internet cafe business in her house.  She also sells school supplies, ice cream, soda, and spicy snacks.  She works every day from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm.  She has many customers, including students that go there to meet together or do homework on the computer.  She has had this business for more than 3 years and has been expanding it little by little.

Married and the mother of nine children, she lives with her husband and three of her children who work in farming and household activities.  Zoila completed only four years of elementary school despite her parents' efforts because she comes from a low-income family.\r\n\r\nZoila has worked with her husband in agriculture for five years, specifically growing coffee.  She learned this work from her parents when she was little; took her to work picking coffee on other people's farms to be able to survive.\r\n\r\nThey acquired part of the land where she currently has her crops with a lot of effort; she inherited the other part from her parents.  Her fields are located a kilometer from her house, so she walks there every day with her children and husband.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Zoila and her husband get out of bed optimistic.

The above listed things are very important in our life; they form our life. If we know how to manage our time and plan actions, we will succeed in many aspects of our life. These rules are used in the developed countries like the USA, European countries, etc. I also like European culture. The culture of the European countries plays a big role in world history, and I want our country to have good relationships with these countries. During my studies at AUCA I would like to get internships in some of Europe's countries. Fortunately the education schedule and system does allow students to take international internships. I would like to mention that this is not the only opportunity that AUCA gives to all of its students. One of them is a Kiva loan. So, I would like to apply for it, so that I will be able to cover my tuition

Gloria Mar\u00eda ve diariamente la escasez de empleo impidiendo que ella trabaje en una empresa privada o p\u00fablica por lo que decidi\u00f3 dedicarse al comercio y ha iniciado un peque\u00f1o negocio de venta de comida el cual la apoya su madre. El punto de su negocio es estrat\u00e9gico ya que es muy transitado por transportistas de buses, camiones, volquetas, etc. y en la zona no hay ning\u00fan tipo de negocio que ofrezca lo que ella hace. Ella ha identificado que los niveles m\u00e1s altos de venta que tiene son los fines de semana pero carece de equipo y herramientas para atender a sus clientes y mejorar su establecimiento.\nPor lo que hoy en d\u00eda ella se ve en la necesidad de solicitar financiamiento para la compra de utensilios de cocina, materia prima, mandar a elaborar un rotulo para que su peque\u00f1o negocio sea m\u00e1s visible, mesas, sillas para que sus clientes puedan sentarse.\nElla sue\u00f1a con que su peque\u00f1o local deje de ser peque\u00f1o y tenga las condiciones adecuadas para que su clientela pueda sentirse c\u00f3modas logrando obtener mejores ingresos, mejorar la atenci\u00f3n y brindando mejores servicios de los que actualmente ofrece. Con las ganancias ella planea hacer un \u00e1rea recreativa para los ni\u00f1os y las familias innovando en su negocio y haciendo un gran \u00e9xito de \u00e9l.\n","en":"Gloria Maria is a young very hard-working entrepreneur, 27 years of age, who is single and responsible for no children. She finished secondary education, thanks to the moral and financial help of her parents, despite their limitations and lack of resources. She graduated with a diploma in science and letters.\r\n\r\nDaily, Gloria Maria witnessed the shortage of jobs, impeding her from working in a private or public enterprise, and she decided to dedicate herself to commerce. She began a small business with her mother's help selling meals. The location of her business is strategic, a route much traveled by buses, trucks, dump trucks, etc. In the zone there is no business similar to hers offering what she offers. \r\n\r\nGloria has noted that the largest sales come on weekends but she lacks the equipment and tools to attend to her customers and improve her establishment. For that reason, Gloria sees that she needs to request financing to purchase kitchen utensils, primary materials, to have a sign made so that her small business will be more visible, and to buy tables, and chairs so that her customers may be seated.\r\n\r\nGloria's dream is that some day, her small business will cease to be small and she can have adequate conditions for her customers to be more comfortable, helping her obtain better income and improve services over those currently offered. \r\n\r\nWith her improved earnings, she plans to create a recreation area for children and families, innovating her business and making a grand success of it.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.12,"image":{"id":1467130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy kitchen utensils and equipment to attend to customers.

For three years now, she has been managing her family food expenses by running two activities: a motorbike for transportation and tailoring. Secilia, who is a tailor, is also training students how to design and make clothes.  She works from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm each working day and is able to make a fair monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be Secilia's third loan from Kiva partner Tujijenge Tanzania. She used her previous loans to expand her portfolio by starting a motorcycle business for transportation and purchasing missing tailoring materials and one business machine.

is a first-year student of the American University of Central Asia, Department of Economics. Here is her story.\r\n\r\n\u201c[A] few years ago a friend of my sister told us about her orientation week at AUCA, classmates, professors, classes and everything that she experienced at AUCA. Her story admired me so much, and I was always thinking about this place. After a small research and talking to students about different universities of Bishkek, I [came to the] conclusion to enroll AUCA. Among offered departments I chose the Economics Department. Of course other universities in Kyrgyzstan also have departments of economics and offer different specializations. However, the Economics Department of AUCA is a unique place where I will gain knowledge in English and will be granted Bard degree that provides a great opportunity to be employed with transnational companies abroad. Besides, I study in diverse community with students from all over the world, gain knowledge from high-qualified local and foreign professors, and will become demanded professional in high competitive job market. I believe that as a result, I will gain knowledge and skills that will lead and open doors to my bright future and achieve my goals to help not only my family, but also a community where I have obtained basic knowledge at school. I would like to mention that this is not the only opportunity that AUCA gives to all its students. One of them is Kiva loan. So, I would like to apply for it, so that I will be able to cover my tuition fees.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1466953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She lives in her parent's house in Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a city known for its indigenous Tsachila residents and for being a productive farming and livestock-raising area. There is much commerce here, as it is the port of exchange between Ecuador's coast and mountain regions. \r\n\r\nJessica built her business over time and out of necessity and lack of employment. She began selling girl's headbands and chocolate balls that she made. As the business grew, she gained experience selling other items. She now has a bazaar in a school where she works with her mother, who also has a small shop. They help each other, and she works from Monday to Saturday for at least 10 hours a day. Business was very good this year, and she has added a copier and school supplies.\r\n\r\nShe has applied to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for a loan to buy notebooks, pens, pencils, paper, and more to stock more inventory for the bazaar. Jessica expects to increase her earnings with this investment and be able to offer her son a better standard of living and all that he needs so that one day he will have a career. Jessica thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and Kiva for the support to make her dreams a reality. One of her dreams is to have a house where she can set up her bazaar and stop renting.

","en":"Zilola is a friendly and positive woman. She has a husband and a few kids. She lives with her family in a small rural village. Zilola is a real master of needlework. She embroiderers national dresses. This is how she makes her living. She has worked at this activity for a long time. She has had time to study all of the details of this business and teach some students. Zilola and her family, from the beginning, have been used to fulfilling orders at a high rate. And because of this, today she has a lot of regular clients. Her spouse works in Russia. He helps her generate income for the general budget of the family. Every month he sends her money.

Malohat is one of these people, who tries to improve life conditions and stimulate economic being of her family.  She is divorced and raised her daughter, who is now 25 years old, by herself.  Her daughter has one child.  Malohat had worked at a kindergarten for many years.  Today, she needs more income because her only daughter became a widow and returned to Malohat's home after her husband's death.  Malohat started her own business in reselling women's and children's clothing three months ago.

Since 2006, she has been running a beauty salon business. Siwajibu works from 6 am to 8 pm each working day, and is able to make a small return each month. \r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania; she will use it to improve her beauty salon by expanding the size of the premises and painting it a nice color. \r\n\r\nWith the previous loans (all of which paid back successfully), she bought a business generator to maintain her business service in case the electricity is shut off. Siwajibu managed also to put a new electricity machine, which currently provides electricity for every power user.

She set up a sewing studio in a small space in her home.  She works Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm and her oldest daughter helps her.  She learned this business from some friends and thanks to training courses provided by the mayor's office she was able to expand her knowledge and improve her technique, which has made her known in the area and won her contracts with good businesses for whom she makes uniforms.  Her charisma, drive, and dedication have allowed her to get ahead and previous loans have provided her with the support to strengthen her business little by little.  This is why she is asking for her sixth loan; she needs to renovate her workspace (paint and expansion) and perform maintenance on her sewing machines' motors.  This will improve her work conditions and give her more space to facilitate her end-of-year output, as her demand increases.  She will also be able to fill her orders in a timely manner with excellently executed, quality garments.  This will generate more income for her household and pave the way to acquiring new contracts.  Berta wants to keep working hard to move forward with her income-generating business as she dreams of having a much bigger sewing workshop that will allow her to grow and offer job opportunities, especially to single mothers.  In this way, she will improve the quality of life of not only her family, but that of all the people who take part in this difficult, demanding work.

One of the members has a small store.\r\n\r\nGladys is a 40-year-old married member of the group with four children who range in age from 8 to 19. They are her treasures and the \u201clight of her eyes\u201d. Like some families in the community, her family is involved with weaving of typical skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d. Currently, Gladys has four employees and because of their assistance, she is able to meet the demand for each week. She has applied for a new loan with Friendship Bridge which she will use to buy a variety of good quality yarn. Gladys is very happy to have this working capital because she will have more material to work with and therefore, more income.\r\n\r\nThe nine women, along with their families, appreciate the opportunity to secure a loan which ultimately benefits everyone in their families since many of the businesses are family businesses. They also look forward to their monthly educational trainings on topics like sales and promotion, savings and indebtedness, medicinal plants, and healthy meals. Armed with their loans and information from their educational trainings, these women look forward to the future where empowered women will eliminate poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1181.88,"image":{"id":1455869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy a variety of good quality yarn to make clothes.

the well-being of their families. Sometimes it is a struggle, but they persevere because they know that a better future lies ahead for themselves and their families. The loans funded by Kiva investors and the educational trainings that they receive from Friendship Bridge are a vital key to their success. They are proud of their accomplishments.\n\nThe ten ladies of the Trust Bank recently completed a loan cycle with Friendship Bridge.\n\nThese loans were generously funded by Kiva investors. The women appreciate the generosity of Kiva investors. The ladies are truly honored that people from all parts of the world believe that the women of \u201cUkux Kem\u201d can progress with the proper tools. Because of the success of the previous loan cycle, the group is requesting a new loan from Friendship Bridge funded by Kiva investors.\n\nThe Ukux Kem Trust Bank is aptly named, as the ladies weave and sell textiles like tablecloths, napkins and traditional shirts or \u201chuipiles\u201d, as well as the traditional skirts or \u201ccortes\u201d.  Juana is a 59-year-old mother of five children and is widowed. She joined Friendship Bridge around five years ago. Juana was greatly relieved when she first found out that she was eligible for a loan, which she is using in her textile manufacturing business. \n\nShe will use the funds to produce more textiles such as the beautiful, traditional skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d, tablecloths and napkins. As the high-selling part of the year is approaching in November and December, Juana has requested a new loan, which she will use to purchase quality thread and yarn in bulk. She employs one of her children, and the pair work hard to make enough income to support the family. Juana makes delivery of her products at least twice per month. Because of her efforts, she is pleased to make her monthly loan payments on time and support her family.\n\nJuana, along with the other members of the Trust Bank, are actively involved in the monthly educational training programs offered by Friendship Bridge.

By capitalising on this, they will increase their stock inventory, improving their supply capacity for their customers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes they can stay in business with the motorcycle workshop and hopes to open a new service centre in the future, when her son comes of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.58,"image":{"id":1456833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy new stock, which is available at good discounts at this time of year because of businesses having clearance sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-12T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-11T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2014-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":56.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.41},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.58,"local_amount":106.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":106.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716411,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T16:57:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625698,"name":"Secundino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Secundino de 48 a\u00f1os, es una persona que vive con su esposa, con quien ha pasado momentos felices como tristes uno de los m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles, fue la noticia que les dieron que por cosas de la vida, no podr\u00edan tener hijos; para poder formar una familia y ver sus hijos crecer, fue algo muy triste dice Secundino; pero a pesar de eso siguen adelante, y tratan la manera de vivir feliz juntos los dos.

She is married and is raising wonderful children. Malohat has more than 8 years of experience in sewing and selling pillows. She buys fabric from the local market, sews the pillows and sells them to her customers at the local market.
