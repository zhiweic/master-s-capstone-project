The men are considered brothers by the community because they are always together doing things, talking, and helping one another. They live in a small, quiet town, where transportation used to be a problem, but taxis are now readily available.\r\n\r\nMarce, 40, represents the group and has been married for 18 years. She has three dependent children who are in school. Marce is hardworking and enterprising. She has three businesses: a diner, a small grocery shop, and selling clothing. She started selling clothing when her mother gave her clothing as a gift 15 years ago, and she works at this job Wednesday through Saturday. She has been managing her grocery store Sunday through Tuesday for four years.  \u201cI wanted to start another business to increase my income and help pay household expenses.\u201d Her grocery shop is in one of the local markets. \u201cI started selling sandwiches and tacos four years ago, but my customers liked my recipes so much that I decided to open a diner to offer more items.\u201d Marce's diner is open every day and is managed by her employees while she is at her other two businesses. \r\n\r\nRafael also sells clothing and has applied for a loan to buy more. Marce's businesses are successful, though her diner has competition. \u201cI think my diner stands out because the food is delicious, and the juices are 100% natural.\u201d The owners of her prior location asked her to move, as they wanted to run the diner. Marce moved to a space where the owners are very nice, and she was able to put in air conditioning. She says she is very lucky. The new location is less visible, but customers know where to find the best food. \r\n\r\nMarce dreams of growing her businesses and opening another diner. She smiles and says, \u201cI will name it Maricela 2.\u201d Her current diner is called Cocina Maricela. If she is able to open a second diner, she will give up her other businesses to concentrate on selling food. \u201cI want my children to become professionals rather than becoming merchants, which is a very hard trade. My daughter is in middle school, and she wants very much to study for a career. I will support her in every way so that she can achieve her dream.\u201d Fernando supports Marce's businesses, but he will invest in household appliances."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4450,"image":{"id":1423912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy groceries such as bread, eggs, milk, sugar, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":58000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6664.61},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6824.01},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6987.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7154.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7325.43},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7500.63},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":7680.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7863.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":511.34},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":523.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":536.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":548.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575.48},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":589.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":603.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1034.94,"local_amount":13489.06,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13537.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227963,"comment":null},{"amount":1085.03,"local_amount":14142.01,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14192.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991808,"comment":null},{"amount":1726.82,"local_amount":22506.84,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":22587.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644456,"comment":null},{"amount":603.21,"local_amount":7862.09,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":7890.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877917,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T21:04:08Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607050,"name":"In\u00e9s Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En Los Bajos de Montecristi, ciudad conocida por su gran diversidad de productos t\u00edpicos, como por ejemplo los sombreros de paja toquillas conocidos dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds se re\u00fanen cada 15  d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal La Dolorosa Del Pechiche.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora In\u00e9s, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen cuatro hijos de  18, 15, 12 y 8 a\u00f1os, los tres mayores estudian en colegio y el menor en escuela.

With this money she plans to purchase more items for the new semester, when pupils and students return to attend schools and colleges.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1428284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more items for the new semester, when pupils and students return to attend schools and colleges.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agsu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 48.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Shamama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.66},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":111.11,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419772350,"comment":null},{"amount":141.66,"local_amount":111.11,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430004771,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":111.11,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T10:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":111.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439641019,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T08:00:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605410,"name":"Hadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the story of Agus, son of Hadi:\r\n\r\nI live near from the rice field.

","en":"Sherali lives with his family in the town of Vahdat. He is 36 years old, is married and has two daughters. One year ago, Sherali opened an internet cafe, which brings him a sufficient income, as it is located in a highly trafficked area.  Sherali has one worker, whom he pays a monthly salary. His internet cafe is open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. \r\n\r\nSherali currently needs a loan.

She is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. She is a hard-working person who takes care of her family by doing business in animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nYegana raises cattle to sell meat. She has been in this business for 10 years. Her husband supports her in the business. The business takes a lot of effort, but together they run it successfully. She sells the meat in the central bazaar where the demand for meat is high. People in Azerbaijan consume plenty of meat because it is used in most dishes. Some traditional meals like kebabs, dolma, and others require beef in their preparation.

In this way, she will continue to offer her services with the ultimate desire to achieve her greatest goal: to have a well-known clothes-making workshop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":183.23,"image":{"id":1425569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T17:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T17:00:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Biviana Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":113.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":126.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":134.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":136.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":141.87},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":155.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":153.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":161.86},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":165.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":174.19},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":178.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185.9},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":194.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":209.32},{"due_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":216.63},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":224.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.26},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.76},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.75},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":113.38,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":115.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054814,"comment":null},{"amount":45.92,"local_amount":125.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":127.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819711,"comment":null},{"amount":46.35,"local_amount":126.41,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":128.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472631,"comment":null},{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":134.69,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":136.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T23:47:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605480,"name":"Madiarjo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is the story of Febriana, daughter of Madiarjo:\r\n\r\nI live in Karang Bawang village, and this is flood-prone area.

is Analina, 40, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Rodolfo, a driver. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAnalina operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat homecooked meals during evenings, when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but also a matter of convenience and a means of frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one person to two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than purchasing raw food. Analina's regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. \r\n\r\nAnalina earns a minimum 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. To help continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 18,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more products, such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings and frozen foods. \r\n\r\nAnalina dreams that her business will continue to flourish and hopes to have a good life.

He lives with his mother, brother and wife. The only employed person in the family is Armen's wife, who works in the private sector at a very low salary. To be able to take care of the family's basic needs Armen breeds livestock, including pigs and piglets. The livestock is the main source of income for them. Armen's family helps him a lot in the activities related to the livestock breeding. \r\n\r\nAs the family's needs are increasing day by day, Armen wants to expand the livestock of pigs and piglets. For this reason, he asks for the lenders' support to help him collect a loan of USD 3,000 to purchase 13 new pigs and to buy some forage for the livestock.

In particular, they have nine pigs and sell piglets seasonally at a good price. In addition, they have a plot of agricultural land, where they grow different kinds of vegetables. They always have high quality products, which they sell to local retailers for good prices.  As the family has only seasonal income, Zurab decided to start dairy farming. He sought credit from local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables the rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan to start or re-start a business. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of $3,100. With the credit he received, he will purchase a cow. After the cow is purchased, the family will start producing dairy products including cheese and yogurt to sell. They will also use the milk products to feed the family. \r\nThe new business initiative will give them a chance to have financial stability and earn a better monthly income.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1428353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Pirveli Sviri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T18:20:06Z","loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zurab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101.36},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105.6},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":108.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":113.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":122.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":123.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":129.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.51},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":137.31},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140.29},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145.61},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.51},{"due_date":"2015-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.96},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156.62},{"due_date":"2015-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.95},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.6},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.94},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.91},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.51},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.31},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.29},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.61},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.51},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.96},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605903,"name":"Qajik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Qajik is a farmer from the Bandivan village in the Shirak region.

La cliente es una mujer emprendedora, activa, pujante y tiene muchas ganas de salir adelante; por eso se motiva a solicitar el cr\u00e9dito que desea invertir en la compra de una m\u00e1quina fileteadora con la cual podr\u00e1 mejorar y agilizar su producci\u00f3n, lo que le permitir\u00e1 entregar un producto bien terminado y de buena calidad, creando la posibilidad de aumentar sus ventas y los ingresos que recibe, con los cuales podr\u00e1 seguir invirtiendo en su negocio y fortalecerlo para que sea rentable, reconocido y perdurable en el tiempo. Diana es consciente que para lograrlo debe trabajar arduamente; s\u00f3lo as\u00ed podr\u00e1 garantizar una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica favorable para disfrutar de mejor nivel de vida y bienestar, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo.","en":"Diana, 34, is married and does not yet have children.  Several years ago she learned everything related to dressmaking, thanks to the teachings of her family.  She has more than three years of experience in this field because she has worked in different workshops where she has been expanding her knowledge and perfecting her technique.  Now she wishes to resume making quilts because she already has customers for these products since she made them some time ago and the customers are requesting them again.\r\n\r\nDiana is an enterprising, active, and strong woman who is eager to get ahead in life.  This is why she is motivated to ask for a loan that she wants to invest in the purchase of an overlock sewing machine with which she could improve and speed up her production.  This would allow her to deliver a completed and high quality product, creating the possibility of increasing her sales and the income that she receives, which she could continue investing in her business and strengthening it in order to be more profitable, well-known, and long-lasting.  Diana is aware that in order to achieve this she has to work hard; only this is able to guarantee favorable financial stability to enjoy a better living standard and well-being, in the company of her husband."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":186.81,"image":{"id":1430397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T18:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T18:30:01Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71411},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73385},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75413},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":77498},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":79640},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81842},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84104},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":86429},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":88818},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91273},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93797},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96390}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.81},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.37},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.81,"local_amount":119633,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":120607.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807486,"comment":null},{"amount":40.31,"local_amount":76775,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":77400.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095574,"comment":null},{"amount":41.6,"local_amount":79246,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79891.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074627,"comment":null},{"amount":42.09,"local_amount":80171,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80823.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009824,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-16T00:59:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605899,"name":"Nickson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nickson is 31 years old.

is from Dalarik village of Armavir region. His family consists of his elderly father, wife and four school age children (a daughter - 8 years old and three sons - 9, 13 and 15 years old).  Zohrab is working in the local self governance body, but the salary he receives there is not even close to covering the family's everyday costs. To take care of his large family, Zohrab breeds a livestock of cows, pigs, piglets, and cultivates alfalfa and grapes. He now wants to maintain and enlarge his livestock a little bit.

The group chose its name because it is a piece of biblical praise that they liked. This group is made up of five happy, enterprising people, each one of which pursues an economic activity with the goal of improving their quality of life. This group is located in a community called Huixcolotla where the main sources of employment are raising livestock and growing sugarcane.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosa is 37 years old; she was able to study only until secondary school. She has four children with her husband, Julian, who learned the carpentry trade when he was working in the United States. When Julian returned home, he decided to open his own carpentry business. Rosa says that they work very hard in the workshop to support their children and provide them with better academic opportunities in the future. They specialize in making furniture (tables, beds, bookshelves, chests of drawers, armoires, windows and doors) and in special orders from customers. They have ten years of experience in the business and during this time they have built their clientele based on the quality of their work; they put significant amounts of time and effort into each piece because they know it will brighten the lives of the family who uses it. \r\nA loan from Vision Fund will help Rosa and Julian purchase wood, nails, contact glue, wood screws and varnish, and to maintain their equipment. This will allow them to continue their business; Rosa hopes that it will keep growing and that someday their children will work alongside them. \r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nBenjamin, lime sales\r\nLucio, pig sales\r\nAzahel, sugarcane farming\r\nElena, bakery\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1201.43,"image":{"id":1430381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase wood, nails, contact glue, wood screws and varnish, and to maintain equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huixcolotla, Tierra Blanca, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-09-15T21:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-15T21:30:01Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azahel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4200},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227974,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991819,"comment":null},{"amount":325,"local_amount":4200,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4254.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644467,"comment":null},{"amount":226.43,"local_amount":2926.18,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2963.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877927,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T02:02:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605943,"name":"Mariafe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariafe is 54 years old, married, and has three children.

She is unmarried and lives with her family. With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Sara is one of the many Iraqi woman who is working from home.  She uses her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\r\n\r\nSara has five years experience and has been working hard to attract clients, improve her skills and increase her productivity. One obstacle she has is the lack of reliable power supply in her area and that having access to electricity for only a few hours a day leaves little predictability about the exact hours when she will be able to work. To overcome this problem she is taking a loan from Kiva partner Relief International Microfinance Iraq in order to buy a generator and an A\/C for her work area. \r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor and thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

The business model of the beauty salon is such that Nelli gets only 50% of the total daily revenue.\r\n\r\nOver years of hard work, Nelli was able to gain a client base that are using only her services. So, in order to increase her income she has decided to work only at home. Now Nelli needs financial support for purchasing a hair dryer, scissors and other working tools specialized for her work. Nelli requested a loan from local financial institutions several times, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because her business isn't registered as a formal business. Nelli has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So this loan will greatly assist Nelly and will give her a chance to develop her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":222.81,"image":{"id":1428501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for a hair dryer, scissors and other working tools for providing hairdresser services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T01:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T01:40:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":19437.6},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17278.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":18236.7},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":18278},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":17706.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":19213.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":19479.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18834.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20008.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":19794},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":19942.9},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20689.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20717.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21034.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21469.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":21786.8},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":21742.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":22592.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":22904.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":22986.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23491.3},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23755.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24119},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24499}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.86},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.36},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.55},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.21},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.98,"local_amount":37136.7,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":37380.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410203183,"comment":null},{"amount":45.19,"local_amount":18443.9,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":18565.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157455,"comment":null},{"amount":86.64,"local_amount":35361.9,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":35594.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845813,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-20T16:13:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607576,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dora, de 20 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y es madre de un ni\u00f1o de 03 a\u00f1os con quien vive en su casa propia.

She lives with her parents and her four siblings, working together to financially support their family.\r\n\r\nShe works in agriculture growing thyme on plots of land that her family has around their home. She learned to do this from her parents since she was a little girl, when she worked for half the day and studied during the other half. \r\n\r\nNow, she has been working independently in agriculture for 10 years since she finished school. Because of the lack of existing job opportunities, she decided to start her own farm, which has now become her principal source of income. \r\n\r\nShe has seen that the earnings generated from working in farming are excellent. Therefore, she wants to expand her harvest by requesting a loan of 4,500.00 Q for the purchase of thyme seeds and organic fertilizer that she needs to farm and so have successful sales, improving her income alongside her family.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to continue working and helping out her family, improving their living conditions and likewise supporting her other siblings who are still studying in the community\u2019s school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2.56,"image":{"id":1430548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase thyme seeds and organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Solola","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -91.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":246,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2.56,"local_amount":20.03,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T08:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":20.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":409993963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-16T23:32:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606049,"name":"Hajara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hajara is married with five children, and all go to school.

Unfortunately, she hasn't been very lucky in her family life: she was unable to have a child and she and her husband got divorced.  Halima had wanted to adopt a child, but her husband had been opposed to it.  \r\n\r\nHalima currently lives with her mother.  Her brothers and sisters have their own families.  In order to provide for herself and her mother, she sells various fabrics at the bazaar of her district, and she makes a good, stable income from this business.  At times, she can even afford to buy treats for herself and to bring some to the children of the local orphanage.  When she sees the joy in their eyes, she feels happy herself.  Unfortunately, because she is a single woman, she cannot adopt a child, but she still hopes for the best.  On weekends, she takes two or three children to her house so that they can feel the warmth of a real home.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Halima and her mother live together hasn't been repaired for a long time, because Halima has never had the financial means to perform any repair.  In fact, all the earnings from her business are spent to meet the daily needs of her family.  And in order to perform repairs, Halima would need a large amount of money.  \r\n\r\nHalima has therefore turned to MDO Arvand to receive a loan for the purchase of building materials to repair her house.  She looks very forward to a positive outcome, and thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":141.24,"image":{"id":1421544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"to buy building materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T05:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T05:00:01Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":330.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":342.07},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":354.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":366.43},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":379.26},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":392.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":406.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":420.49},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":435.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":450.44},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":466.2},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":482.52},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":499.41},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":516.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":534.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":553.7},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":569.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.41},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.32},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.3},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.59},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.33},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.88},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.35},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.28},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.41,"local_amount":330.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":330.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900999,"comment":null},{"amount":71.83,"local_amount":342.07,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":342.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550181,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T01:58:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607104,"name":"Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento ESPERANZA,  Est\u00e1  compuesto por ocho integrantes siete mujeres y un var\u00f3n,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

Franklin lives in this city. He is 43 years old, single and lives with his parents. He has been a member of the communal bank for five years. He really appreciates the help that this institution has given him in his efforts to get ahead. Franklin is a very hardworking man who is using his knowledge to get ahead in life. He works in his family's woodworking and furniture-making business, where he sells his creations. They make beds, other types of furniture and anything else you can make out of wood. They sell out of their workshop as well as in other cities, where they sell at very good prices. Their business has been around for over 50 years and has been passed down from generation to generation. Franklin decided to take out a new loan similar to the previous one, since it helped him tremendously: he was able to weather a very tough situation precisely because the loan enabled him to invest in supplies to make furniture. This loan will be used to buy wood, paint, nails and other carpentry materials that they need to make their products. His dream is to keep in business and to sell more furniture.

With the 800 soles she asks for, Rosa will buy more drinks to sell, of various makes and tastes."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":140.47,"image":{"id":1430537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy drinks to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":128.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":127.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":140.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":147.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.6},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":118.46,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":123.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410353834,"comment":null},{"amount":48.12,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T18:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":133.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905598,"comment":null},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":127.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-21T10:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":132.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091585,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-17T15:42:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607582,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":20.95,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build a feed silo to store feed for her two cows, who are about to give milk.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T09:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":155.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.05},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.95,"local_amount":20.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716639,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T01:46:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606075,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane is 51 years old and lives in Kapan city.

All of them are women who know each other very well. Their great friendship is what distinguishes them. They have been getting loans from VisionFund for two cycles. They live in a Mazahua community and still conserve their regional traditions. The most important crop there is corn. In fact, during the month of September, the people in the area can finally enjoy the ears of corn after several months of cultivation. The members chose the name Manita de \u00c1ngel because at the group representative's house there is a plant with that name. Alicia is 39 years old. She has been married for 22 years to Fabi\u00e1n who is a merchant. Together they have created a family with three children who are in school. Alicia sells accessory products such as beads, pins, headbands, antennas, threads, batteries, etc. She has been doing this for 22 years. Alicia remarked \u201cI started selling from a small tray, walking around the plazas. I started the initiative to sell myself.\"  This time, with the loan, Alicia will buy more merchandise since it is important to have products to offer. Alicia and her husband have difficulty selling their merchandise since they weren't allowed to set up in the plazas. but they worked really hard and were able to get a stable spot in the street market. Nonetheless, they also go out to sell in other places to cover a wider area and have more profit. Alicia's goal is to be able to have another stable spot, more than anything to grow her business. Her earnings will be a big help to pay for her children's education expenses. They really want to be able to go to college and improve their quality of life. The members of the group are Ana Elizabeth and Janet. They are going to use their loans to invest in clothes. Felisa, Celedonia, Josefina and Rosalba will use it to invest in cleaning supplies, and Irene will invest in sheep and chickens. They are very grateful to Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan. It will be a big help to grow their businesses, which will allow them to improve their and their families' quality of life.

","en":"Jedislenni is 28 years old. She is the mother of one 8 year old son and lives with her romantic partner. Seven years ago, she started working in a women's clothing store as a counter salesperson. A few months ago, she decided to go off on her own and she opened her own business. It consists of selling blouses designed by her. After she designs them she orders them to be made and then distributes them to different customers in the city. She does all of these activities alone, but during special times she hires someone else to help her because the number of orders goes up, especially the second half of the year. This requires her to have good working capital. She is an active, enterprising, creative and driven woman.  In order to keep getting ahead, she is asking for this loan to invest in buying raw materials (fabric, accessories, thread, buttons) and to pay the sewers who make her designs. This allows her to increase her working capital and get more production to satisfy the requirements and needs of the customers who are stocking up for the Christmas season. All of this is reflected in the increase of profitability and income she makes. With them, she wants to keep investing in her business until she attains her dream os having her own brand that is recognized in the marketplace, getting production to distribute wholesale and generate more employment opportunities. This way, Jedislenni will be able to improve her family's quality of life and well being.

She lives with her husband, Helder,  with whom she has four children to look after, in her aunt's house.  While Nerida makes a living looking after farmland, her husband's job is buying and selling animals such as bulls, sheep, and pigs.  Nerida tells us that, thanks to this work, the couple are able to cover daily household costs, such as food and the children's school costs.  In the beginning it was very difficult to start to earn an income because the couple did not have the necessary capital.  Nevertheless, with a lot of effort and patience, the couple saved up the money.  Now, Nerida is hoping to be able to improve her potato, corn and other crops, which she grows on rented land, in a business with other farmers.  Nerida still does not have her own land.

Gulnara's industriousness has enabled her monthly income to reach 2,000 som (KGS). Thanks to her efforts, she has been successful. Currently her farm has 1 dairy cow with a calf. With the goal of increasing her number of animals, Gulnara applied for a loan at the Bai Tushum & Partners microloan bank in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. Gulnara plans to put the income earned from the loan into increasing her number of animals, and she hopes to marry off her older son in the future as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.29,"image":{"id":1408067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-09-16T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-16T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1821},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1929},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1986},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2043},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2103},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2164},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2227},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2292},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2359},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2431}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.51},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.7},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.41,"local_amount":3591,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3693.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014093,"comment":null},{"amount":79.88,"local_amount":3804,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T09:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3912.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426988,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-18T14:33:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":605961,"name":"Warni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The story of Saeful, son of Warni:\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a first grader in vocational school now.

This is 35-year-old Rosina from Masvingo. She is single with no children. Rosina is a member of Tanaiwa Group. She also cares for five dependents. Rosina runs an agri-business selling tomatoes, beans and vegetables. The business has been in operation for 20 years.

35-year-old Fatmata from the Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of one year and four years.  \r\n\r\nShe began her business because she wants to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband. In 2008, Fatmata established her general store business. She works at the business from 8 am to 12 pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, juice, and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. In the future, Fatmata plans to own the biggest shop in the community. She thanks you for your
