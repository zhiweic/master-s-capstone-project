","en":"Amina is 60 years old and lives with her husband. She was born to a simple farm family as one of many children but grew up as a very independent child and always helped her mother around the house. Amin has a college education and has raised two children with her husband who now live in Bishkek. Amina is a kind an honest woman and loves life. She and her husband are now retired but have started a livestock farm together in 1992. They began their business with 1,000 som (KGS) but their hard work and perseverance helped them expand the herd to include 4 cows, 20 sheep and 2 horses. The monthly profit of the family is about 3,000 som (KGS). In order to continue expanding her livestock business, Amina has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 55,000 som (KGS) which she will use to purchase a cow and a few sheep. Amina is planning to use the profits from this loan to continue increasing the number of animals and so be able to improve the lives of her family. In the future Amina hopes to save enough money to purchase a car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1223474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow and sheep to increase the herd","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"At-Bashi Village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-27T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-26T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33000},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":705},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":705,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":33161.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071269,"comment":null},{"amount":470,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":22107.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-30T04:59:19Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:26:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":488441,"name":"Aurita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Aurita.

Jahya initiated his business by raising 50 catfishes. At the moment, he has three fishponds and raises 1,000 catfishes. It takes three months to raise the fish before selling them to the customer. His wife and the children are also involved in looking after them.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Jahya really wants to enlarge his business by purchasing catfish seeds and building up the pond. Unfortunately, he does not have enough capital to go through with this plan. Jahya then went to TLM and applied a loan amounting 4,500,000 IDR (Indonesia rupiah).

He says they chose this name because this little plant is very lucky. Although in the past some people didn't meet their payments and left the group, the remaining members are responsible and continue with the group because they help each other so the group can meet all payments. \r\n\r\n\"To\u00f1o, the photographer\" says he is known in his town. He started his business more than 30 years ago because since young he was struck on photography because his parents gave him a camera for his birthday. From there, he likes to take pictures of all beautiful things that nature has. \r\n\r\nThat's why he used to go to the Mariposa Monarca Sanctuary at an early hour, which is not far from his home, to take pictures of the sunrise with the butterflies when the sun had its first flashes of light and illuminated the beautiful forests of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. He says that caught his attention and decided to take a photography course through correspondence. Since he didn't have a steady job, he decided to start a photo studio and take the best moments of people and thus obtain profits from what passionate him that is photography. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to VisionFund because he wants to buy materials he uses for his photography such as material for developing, films for cameras, photo frames, albums for sale, bags, digital cameras, USB drivers, etc. He says he buys the material in the city of Mexico in several stores specialized in photography. He expects to improve the quality of life of his family with this loan.\r\n\r\nHe says his goal is to have a place where he can have his own business because rents are very high and he has losses. He also expects to have more work in order to make his dreams come true.       \r\n\r\nThe other 11 members of the group are Gabriella, Edit Veronica, Esperanza, Maria de Jesus, Ma Consuelo, Maria Eugenia, Edith, Maria Claudia, Natividad, Margarita y Juliette.

Living with them are one daughter who studying nursing in college and two grandchildren. They help one of their daughters to support her children. Juan belongs to a group called El Fresno de la Soledad [The Ash Tree of La Soledad]. He says that they chose this name because there was an ash tree near their meeting place, and because their community is called La Soledad, and they decided to join the names together to name their group so that it would be easier to remember. He says that he has had a small grocery store for eight years, and that he opened it so that he could better help his family and his household. He also cultivates avocado and corn, which he sells at a supply center in a nearby village. He says that he sells his products twice a week to various other stores. He tells us that he opened his store in order to improve his household income and because there are no well-stocked stores like his in the area. He tries to have all the basic staples in his store for sale. He says that he is now requesting a loan for the purchase of eggs, even though the price of eggs has gone up quite a bit, because it is his most popular product. He will also buy sugar, soap, milk, bleach, salt, oil, cornmeal, rice, beans, chilli, mayonnaise, ham, sausage, bread, toilet paper, feminine products, etc. He wants to improve his store because he cannot afford to lose customers. His store is the best store in the community. He says that he also wants to buy some fertilizer and insecticides in order to improve his avocado trees, since he has to keep them very well-protected against the strong frost that is coming. He also needs to buy good fertilizers that won't burn the plants. \r\nThe other five group members are called Francisca, Omar, Rogelio, Felipe and Luis Antonio.

She is part of a group called \"Mariposas.\" \r\n\r\nShe says that it is the first time they have worked with Visi\u00f3n Fund, and that all the members are very happy. She says, \"We formed our group because we all need working capital to invest in our businesses. We went around asking several financial institutions, but none convinced us like Visi\u00f3n Fund, as it is the one with the lowest interest rates, and we decided to work with this institution.\" \r\n\r\nShe says that she works every day making tortillas with a woman who makes approximately 50 dozen tortillas a day by hand, the equivalent of some 600 tortillas. She works from Monday to Saturday to be able to help her husband with the household expenses, even though she would like to be self-employed and have a stable business. \r\n\r\nShe says she would like to sell tortillas from her home. Currently, she is asking for a loan to invest in the purchase of mattresses, sheets, bed coverings, towels and comforters by catalog. \r\n\r\nA friend told her that good earnings can be made selling bedding, and she hopes that it will go very well, as she bought the catalogs and people have already made several orders with her. Now all she needs is working capital to supply the orders. She says that she will sell on a payment plan, to make it easier for the customers to pay, and for her to gradually recover her investment. \r\n\r\nOlga is very happy, because she is really looking forward to having her own business, both making tortillas and selling bedding. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Feliza, Leticia, Maria Guadalupe, Anna Maria Arsenia, Juan and Sonia. They will invest their loans in the purchase of goods to sell: car parts, seasonal fruits and vegetables, seasonal women shoes, shoes by catalog, clothing by catalog, and candy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":1219309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

She is a member of the Las Divinas Communal Bank and says that they gave it that name because when they started the group a very popular serial started about some girls called Las Divinas and the group thought it sounded good and decided to name themselves that. Dora laughs a bit ashamed when she says the name of the group.\r\n\r\nShe says that she sells perfume for women and men, firming creams, scrubs, skin moisturizers, cosmetics, such as blush, powder and liquid makeup, nail polish and household items. She works for three companies and sells by catalog.

She says she already has various things on order since right now she does not have the capital for supplies because she sells to her customers on credit. She notes that she buys her products from authorized distributors because they give her good prices. She also wants to sell quilts by catalog. She says, \u201cI would also like to sell quilts so that I can provide a little more to my household and thus be able to buy my children what they need for their education. There are times when I cannot buy them supplies all at once. That is why I am so eager to buy them new clothes and shoes and not second hand items, as I am used to doing since at times I do not have enough,\u201d she says, smiling timidly.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Rosalinda, who will invest her loan in buying clothing for ladies and gentlemen, Maria Guadalupe who will invest in thread, frames, needles, and yarn to make blankets,

She is a woman eager to get ahead with her children. Recently she had to separate from her husband due to personal problems but she is doing as much as she can to help her children, whom she loves greatly, get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of Los Inversionistas Communal Bank and says they chose that name because the loans they request from the field partner are also invested in their businesses and, thanks to the funding, they have been able to gradually grow their businesses.\r\n\r\nMary, as they fondly call her, says that she engages in several activities in order to be able to buy what is necessary to educate her children because she has two in primary school. She says she gets up very early to make them breakfast and then takes them to their school. Immediately afterwards she puts up her stall, which she has in front of her childrens\u2019 school, where she sells drinks, sweets, caps, blouses and dresses knitted by hand that she makes herself. She also says that during the cold months she makes knitted scarves, caps, and gloves and they sell very well. In the afternoons, upon leaving her childrens\u2019 school, she collects her stall and then makes a meal quickly because then she goes to buy bread that she later sells on one of the principal streets of her town, which is called Zitacuaro. On weekends she goes to a restaurant to work as a waitress and thus is able to earn tips to maintain her household.\r\n\r\nMary says that she is proud to be a single mother because she, alone, is helping her children get ahead in their studies. She says \u201cthanks to the loans, they have made me save more and become more responsible and I have been able to manage the money I earn better and I have made my business grow and I am doing well.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe says that at the moment, she is requesting a loan to buy the supplies to continue doing her knitting. Now she wants to begin another business making flan, cheesecake, cakes and jello and sell them at her stall where she sells her knitted goods and sweets.\r\n\r\nMary\u2019s goal is to have her own home because she is now renting a house and she would like to have something of her own so she won\u2019t have to spend so much in rent. She also wants a space where her merchandise will be safe. \r\n\r\nThe other nine members of the group are named Mariana, Eva de los Milagros, Jose Antonio, Gloria, Maria del Carmen, Eva, Marcelino, Lucila and Esmeralda. They will invest in their business of selling shoes by catalog, buying and selling women\u2019s clothing, doing repairs in a machine shop, selling seasonal fruit and vegetables, perfume, cosmetics and will buy material to make embroidered handicrafts and compost and fertilizer to cultivate chiles manzanas (very hot chiles).\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":1220272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to

solidarity to receive loans from Kiva through IMF HOPE RDC with the goal of developing their businesses. \r\n\r\nChristian started his business in 2006. He sells charcoal at the market located north-east of the city of Lubumbashi. Besides that, he also runs a sewing workshop. He is a loyal client of IMF HOPE RDC who has already received 13 different loans and has repaid them properly. He intends to use the next loan to reinforce his business by purchasing sewing items and more sacks of charcoal in bulk that are needed by his customers and reselling them at a profit with the aim of increasing his profits.

Margarita is one of those producers who, year after year, makes Christmas look beautiful with spectacular poinsettias of different sizes, colors and varieties. She says, \u201cI am proud to belong to this bountiful land; it is lovely to work with the flower that is most requested in December because it represents the birth of baby Jesus.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe has been growing poinsettias for more than 10 years and, although sales have dropped drastically because so many people in the region also cultivate the flowers, she continues working because it is still a good business, although she invests too much time and capital in it. Right now she is requesting a loan to purchase fertilizer and paint for the greenhouses so the flowers will not mature too quickly and will be in good condition. She also will buy decorative paper because the big sales will begin in less than a month. She says that buyers from all over the country and abroad are coming because about 20 minutes away from her town there is a Monarch butterfly sanctuary and in December, the butterflies arrive.\r\n\r\nMargarita says she grows different varieties of poinsettias such as the Japanese, Chinese, Marbel, Marbel Star, etc. She says that her goal is to buy a van to use to transport her flowers and sell them in other states of the country so she will not have to pay freight because it is a bit expensive. \r\n\r\nThe four other members of the group are Diana, Erika, Maria Teresa and Florinda.

Jackline is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasese, in the Fortportal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children; one of them is currently in school. For the past four years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells herbal liquid soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more chemicals that will be used for making the liquid soap for sale, which will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her child. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to build a permanant house for herself. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

Ensherah is employed and earns a low salary, which is not enough to cover all her needs.\r\n\r\nEnsherah is requesting a USD loan from FATEN, to help her cover the cost of purchasing a new laptop. This will help Ensherah to do her homework and reports for work, and help her son in his studies. This will ensure a better future for Ensherah and improve the family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional computer parts and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAdora dreams to have a good future and hopes to expand her business all by the grace of God.

Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Chemwai and Kiyo'. She will use the loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nSusan has been doing this work for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services.\r\n\r\nSusan was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Because i have seen Juhudi Kilimo improving the lives of people in my village by financing farmers'. This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'I learnt about the kind of projects financed by micro-finance institutions'.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expenses are farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?' Susan replied, 'I will sell milk and get money to feed my family and also educate my children'.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Susan owns the following: 'cow, poultry, bicycle' but does not own 'pig, pump, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":676.16,"image":{"id":1224140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She is 57 years old and lives with her husband. Kulbarchin is a cheerful, kind and honest woman. Kulbarchin is a Mother Heroine [note: this is a title from Soviet times, given to mothers of large families], as she and her husband raised 8 children, most of whom now live in Bishkek. After the fall of the USSR, Kulbarchin began working in agriculture - animal husbandry and milk sales. Her husband helps her with the farming. Thanks to her hard work and determination, today their farm is very developed and well-maintained. The monthly income of their family is approximately 3,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Because livestock prices are currently low, Kulbarchin wants to increase the number of livestock she has, and has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy 12 sheep and 1 cow. She plans to use the income that will be generated by this purchase to increase her herd and thus improve her standard of living. In the future, she plans to further increase her herd, which will help to realize her long-held dream of building a house. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":1224158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 12 sheep and 1 cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl - Oktyabr village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-29T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-28T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulbarchin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":20226.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012455,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10113.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495372,"comment":null},{"amount":1505,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":70791.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776896,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-16T03:19:08Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:16:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":489006,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 35 years old, married and supports a family of five people.

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which lies in the northern part of the Rift Valley. She has seven children and has been doing her work for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, transportation services, and a personal business.\r\n\r\nRoselwe stated what is most enjoyable about farming is, \"Keeping dairy cows and horticulture!\" Her biggest challenge is animal feeds during dry season and diseases. The animals on her farm have been given the names of Korai, Cheboron and Lab. She will use this loan to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nRoselwe was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"Because it finances small holder farmers in their activities.\" This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She says, \"It is short term loans for farmers.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked, \"How will this loan benefit your family?\", Roselwe replied, \"Money from the sale of milk will help in paying the school fees for my children and [provide] milk for drinking.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Roselwe owns the following: cow and poultry, but does not own a pig, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV or DVD.\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

When asked \"How will this loan benefit your family?\" Esther replied, \"More milk for sale hence more money for family upkeep.\" This loan will help her buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Esther owns the following: cow, poultry, and bicycle; but does not own  a pig, pump, motorcycle, or automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan.
