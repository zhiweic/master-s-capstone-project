Unfortunately, Adrian was unable to study a professional career because he had to go to work very young to help out his parents who work in the fields as farmers; they taught him this business.\r\n\r\nOn his own initiative and with much effort and dedication, Adrian works in agriculture.  He has a small parcel he\u2019s growing corn, sweet potatoes and potatoes on.  He works every day starting very early in the morning and works for about 8 hours.  He believes he does well because of his experience and the kind way he treats others.\r\n\r\nAdrian is very grateful to Kiva lenders because thanks to the support provided he will be able to buy manure and fertilizer and pay labor costs to irrigate and medicate his crop.  In this way, Adrian will be able to maintain his crops in good condition and he\u2019ll get a good crop yield so he can continue working and striving towards reaching his greatest dream: to finish building his house and provide a good education for his little

This will be their 4th loan. The featured member Satyabhama is the one who is standing in the front with raised hand in the photo. She is 46 years old, living in a small house with her husband, four sons aged 18,16,14, and 12 years, and her father-in-law who is suffering from paralysis. \r\n\r\nSatyabhama is a very shy-natured and hard-working lady. Her main source of income is cloth weaving and selling. This is her traditional business. Presently she is managing her business successfully with two hand looms where she mainly weaves sari. Satyabhama and her husband do all the work jointly. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread) from a nearby town on credit basis and gives the finished products to the same merchant, which does not give expected returns. She is running in a continuous loss and facing a lot of trouble to maintain the household and cover educational and medical expenses of her family.  So she is planning to utilize the whole loan amount to purchase more stock of raw materials like yarn of her own. This will help her to arrest some unnecessary losses resulting from the credit delivery system and frequent movements to bring raw materials. \r\n\r\nSatyabhama dreams of constructing a house for her family because the present house is very congested for the family members. Jajnasini, Belmati,Sabitri and Purnami are the other four members doing cloth vending, cloth weaving, and footwear

Mukula is one of them who is sitting in the middle raising her hand in the photo. She is 43 years old, living with her husband and two sons aged 32 and 30 years. \r\n\r\nMukula is a very energetic and hard-working lady. Traditionally she is running a cloth weaving unit in her house. Presently she has three hand looms for weaving of saris. Mukula has engaged two skilled laborers to help her in weaving. Mukula pays Rs.100\/- as labor charges to the weavers. Her husband also weaves saris in the first half of the day and in the second half moves to different villages by bike for selling. From this business Mukula earns a net income of 6,000 INR which is not sufficient to manage her family and plan for future. Her husband brings raw materials (yarn\/thread) from a nearby town on both cash and credit basis and gives the finished products to the same merchant, which does not give fair returns. So she is planning to utilize the whole loan amount to purchase more stock of yarn. \r\n\r\nThis will help her to arrest some unnecessary expenses resulting from frequent movements to bring in raw materials. The role of Mukula in the business is to do the work of processing yarn. Mukula wants to save some money for the marriages of her two sons in the near future and construct a house. The other four members of the group are Lalita, Anjali, Kshiramati and Dhanmati who are doing jewellery-making work, general store, tailoring and cloth weaving businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To pay for purchasing more yarn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"TUKLA,KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lalita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanmati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kshiramati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mukula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":156000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T14:42:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496539,"name":"Abagambakamu Kibogo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonard is a 32-year-old married man with six children aged between 12 years old and 1 year old who reside in Kagadi, Uganda.

is a careful mother of three children and a lovely wife. She started her business 10 years ago with cooking cakes, biscuits, pies, etc. She is hard working and works hard every day for nine or 10 hours. She has many customers and sells her products at the canteen. After the organization of the business, the quality of her family's living conditions became better. \r\n\r\nShe provides her children with all the modern conveniences, but her income is not enough to pay for her son\u2019s education at the university.

years old and lives in the city of Ica, in the Santiago district, with his partner and their little 2-year-old daughter. He loves his family and they are his main motivation in life. He is a very kind, hard-working, and enthusiastic person, who does everything he can to support his family. Unfortunately, Eleo was not able to become a policeman as he would have liked, because he had to start working when he was very young due to financial problems which meant he had to support his mother and his younger siblings. In his free time, he likes to play football with his friends, and his partner sometimes spoils  him by making delicious Tallerines Rojos [a Peruvian spaghetti dish] because it is his favorite food. \r\n\r\nOn his own initiative, and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Eleo works as an agricultural worker on an farm in his city.

He's a very honest, dedicated and hardworking person. He was born in a country area which is well known for its agrarian industries. His sons work in Russia, however, they don't have stable employment so Hotamaly can't rely on them fully for support. Therefore, he makes a living by growing crops ad raising animals, areas in which he has significant experience. Mainly, he grows wheat and barley.  His wife helps him run his business. \r\n\r\nHe uses profits from the crops to purchase cattle for cheap on the market, after which his wife fattens the cattle for a period of time and then they sell it for a high price. Hotamaly spends his income on his household in order to improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis year, he planted two hectares of land with barley, but was unable to reap a good harvest due to poor weather. Therefore, he approached our organization requesting a loan to buy some cattle and expand his animal raising business. He feeds his cattle with fodder from his fields. \r\nHotamaly hopes for your help.

Even though he does not have his own family, he has managed to forge a career future and many objectives to fulfill, a product of which is owning his house made of wood. He has three years experience doing farming work, having cocoa and organic coffee as his main product. He works at this job in a parcel of land that he acquired some years ago with the support of his parents and, since then, he has been able to pay some family bills since they are already at an advanced age.\r\n\r\nHe develops his work on many occasions alone and on others with the support of workers who he manages to hire often being his cousins and friends. He considers his work to be very beneficial since the quality of cocoa that his land produces is optimal and well quoted by collectors doing their very rewarding and profitable work. However, harvesting the cocoa is almost a dilemma since his parcels are found on very uneven land. Not foreign to the planting season and maintenance of the cocoa trees, he wishes to have bags of organic fertilizer and hire workers again to remove a part of the land on his land with the objective of making them more productive.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he wishes to accumulate capital to start a grocery business to occupy his time while he waits for the periodic maintenance that his plantations require. This is his fifith loan. He is very committed to compliance and responsibility. He is thankful to be part of his community bank made up of very responsible people who make savings a good tool for progress. With the 1,000 new \"soles\" he will hire workers to remove a part of land on his land and therefore maintain his cocoa trees.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1236182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T11:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T11:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":109.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":109.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":120.58},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124.55},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":128.64},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":129.46},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":140.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.78},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.91,"local_amount":109.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188853,"comment":null},{"amount":43.8,"local_amount":109.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":114.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572750,"comment":null},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":120.58,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":126.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122415,"comment":null},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":124.55,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":130.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868235,"comment":null},{"amount":51.46,"local_amount":128.64,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":134.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577054,"comment":null},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":129.46,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":135.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529350,"comment":null},{"amount":54.86,"local_amount":137.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":143.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974471,"comment":null},{"amount":56.14,"local_amount":140.36,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":147.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995904,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T14:30:44Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496303,"name":"Construyendo Sue\u00f1os Con Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco Comunal se llama \u201cConstruyendo sue\u00f1os con Esperanza\u201d est\u00e1 conformado por 19 emprendedores quienes se dedican a diferentes rubros entre los cuales se encuentran; venta de empanadas, venta de lencer\u00eda, venta de perfumes, venta de joyas de plata, feriantes, venta de ropa, servicios entre otros.

This group of teachers has come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to apply for a loan of  8,300,000 Sierra Leone Leones for the entire group. With the help of this loan, they can meet certain financial challenges that cannot be met with their salaries alone. And at the end of each month, they repay the loan, using their monthly salaries. Their school\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for doing the deductions and making the repayments on their behalf. \r\n\r\nKhalie is the featured leader of this group of teachers.

Hace 3 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 dar un giro a su actividad econ\u00f3mica, desde entonces se dedica a la producci\u00f3n integral de cacao, opt\u00f3 por este rubro debido a ser una actividad algo mas din\u00e1mica mas no sencilla. Es poseedora de unas parcelas adquiridas a unos t\u00edos quienes en calidad de sobrina optaron por brindarle un precio nada despreciable.\nPara el desarrollo eficiente de sus actividades cuenta con el apoyo de Cayo, adicionando a ello la contrata de jornaleros con quienes viene trabajando desde su primera temporada de cultivo. Considera su trabajo muy rentable debido a ser el cacao un producto permanente y de producci\u00f3n en cantidades masivas que dejan en cada producci\u00f3n una buena rentabilidad para el sost\u00e9n familiar, no obstante el inconveniente principal que aqueja una producci\u00f3n final eficiente son el ataque de algunas plagas y malezas que se apoderan de los \u00e1rboles de cacao e impiden un normal crecimiento de los frutos haciendo de este un gran problema que la afecta no solo a ella sino tambi\u00e9n a gran parte de los agricultores de su zona.\nRequiere para la presente temporada contar con capital suficiente, que le permita invertir en la contrata de jornaleros para el deshierbo y la poda de los \u00e1rboles cuyo pago en su caso lo debe realizar de forma adelantada, adicionando a ello sacos de abono org\u00e1nico muy necesarios para garantizar una producci\u00f3n final eficiente.  Este es su s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, desde su cr\u00e9dito inicial tuvo la gran oportunidad de hacer que su trabajo sea mas din\u00e1mico ya que el contar con capital a la mano le fue de gran ayuda. Se siente muy comprometida con el trabajo  de su banco comunal siendo ella muy puntual a las reuniones de grupo.\nCon los 1,000 nuevos soles realizar\u00e1 el pago por adelantado a los jornaleros para brindarle el mantenimiento integral preventivo a sus plantaciones de cacao.\n\n","en":"Elizabeth, 34, is married to Cayo, 33. They have two children, Soledad (14) and Adriel (11). They live together in a house made of bricks, where they share their life experiences. Three years ago, she decided to drastically change her line of work. Since then, she grows cocoa, an activity that is more dynamic, but not necessarily simpler. She owns several parcels of land that she bought from her uncles and aunts, who gave her a good price because she was part of the family.\r\n\r\nCayo helps her to be more efficient in her work, and in addition, she hires day laborers, with whom she has worked since the first sowing season. She thinks her business is very profitable because cocoa is a multi-season plant and can be produced in large quantities, which results in good profits for supporting her family. However, the main obstacles affecting an efficient production are plagues and weeds that take over the cocoa tree and hinder the fruit\u2019s growth. These are not only her problems; they affect most farmers in the region.\r\n\r\nShe requires now enough capital for the current season, in order to pay for the labor needed for weeding and pruning the trees, which in her case, has to be done in advance. In addition, she will buy compost, which is important in order to guarantee an efficient production. This is her seventh credit with MFP. Already from the first credit, she was able to dynamize her work by having capital available, which was of great help. She is committed to working with her communal bank and she attends all the group meetings punctually.\r\n\r\nWith the 1000 nuevos soles [PEN] she will pay the day laborers in advance for the

He lives together with his wife, 30-year-old Rosana, and they live happily together as a family alongside their two children.  For the comfort of his family, Gelacio managed to buy a house made from wood.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he was a very young boy, Gelacio was a lot of help to his parents in their many farming activities and tasks, helping them to grow a variety of produce including the most widely-grown crop in the region: cacao.  When he came of age and settled down in a formal relationship with Rosana, Gelacio started receiving his own material inheritance from his parents consisting of plots of land containing organic cacao trees.  As a result, for the past eight years he has been a large producer in his area, in common with many other local people.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Gelacio has experienced both good and bad moments.  One which particularly stands out is when his crops were attacked by a plague of insects.  On more than one occasion this has ruined his crops and forced him to completely re-new his plantings.  Gelacio is currently starting a new stage of planting new cacao trees.  At this time, he must take all necessary measures to ensure a good-quality yield.  One of his needs is to acquire sacks of organic fertilizer (bird guano).  He also needs to put to one side enough money to be able to hire day laborers who will be a great help to him in maintaining his crops and weeding around his trees.  \r\n\r\nGelacio is happy to be requesting his first loan from MFP.  He feels grateful and committed to making his repayments.

areas surrounded by water of the Atlantic ocean. Many of the members are selling goods like clothing, shoes or cosmetics. Others sell seafood, run fried food stalls and other businesses. \r\n\r\nMarcelina is a married woman, mother of eight children, five of whom live together with her and their father. She said that her most difficult challenge has been to built her house, which she started and still needs to finish.

He's single and the father of little Diego, just three-year-old.  Luis owns a wood-frame house and currently lives in the town of Santa Rosa.  He has earned his living producing coffee and cacao for five years, and he's his own boss thanks to some parcels of land he managed to buy.  Since he was very young he has been obsessed with work and the desire to succeed.  \r\n\r\nLuis generally works alone because there's not that much land and it's easily accessible.  He likes being a farmer because he considers it honest work and a good and harmless way to make a living.  Nevertheless, he does have to deal with periods when brokers are paying low prices for his product while he hopes for better next season.  He wants to keep on working undefeated, so he needs to start out every season with seedbeds and guano fertilizer in order to produce a quality product.\r\n\r\nAmong his medium and long-term goals are, on one hand, to buy more land to expand production to a higher level, and, on the other hand, to open a grocery store in the city so he can rest a bit from farming while he's not needed on the farm.  Luis has had four loans with MFP and is really grateful for their confidence, to which he intends to respond with punctual payments.  Moreover, he completely approves of the communal bank's performance because the environment inspires collective responsibility. \r\n\r\nLuis plans to use the 3000 soles to buy organic fertilizer and coffee and cacao plants for his seedbeds.  He'll put the rest aside for a rainy day.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1236216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer and cacao and coffee plants for his seedbed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":329.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":328.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":361.75},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":373.66},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":385.96},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":388.41},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":411.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.95},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.89},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":126.25,"local_amount":329.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":330.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188858,"comment":null},{"amount":125.93,"local_amount":328.52,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":329.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572755,"comment":null},{"amount":138.67,"local_amount":361.75,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":363.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122420,"comment":null},{"amount":143.24,"local_amount":373.66,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":375.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868240,"comment":null},{"amount":147.95,"local_amount":385.96,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":387.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577059,"comment":null},{"amount":148.89,"local_amount":388.41,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":389.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529355,"comment":null},{"amount":157.72,"local_amount":411.44,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":413.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974476,"comment":null},{"amount":161.35,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":422.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995909,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-19T14:32:24Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496667,"name":"Kaba Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is called Kaba and has two partners as its members.

Kassim sells cereals (simsim or sesame, sorghum and groundnuts) near the roadside.

His main clients are restaurants and households for daily consumption. His major challenge is the continuous price fluctuations of the cereals. He also spends a lot of money on renting a pounding machine, apparently. He hopes that he will be able to own his own machine using the next loan so as to reduce the cost of renting.\r\n\r\nHe is promising to pay all his loan installments on time.

areas surrounded by water of the Atlantic ocean. Many of the members are selling goods like bread, clothing, shoes or cosmetics. Others sell seafood, run fried food stalls and other businesses. \r\n\r\nJanira lives together with her long-term partner and her little child. She is running a bakery where she sells bread. She started her business around six years ago. She has been investing every loan to increase her sales and to buy different gadgets. This is her 11th loan.

Their three small daughters Leonela, Ruth and In\u00e9s bring additional joy to their home and represent the motivation that every parent needs in order to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nThey currently live in a solid material house, which is rented. Her commercial strategy is to take advantage of rising opportunities and this is why two months ago she opened a grocery store with her effort and with Filem\u00f3n\u2019s and their daughters' help.\r\n\r\nShe also works in the agricultural sector, but since there is no constant demand for labor, she thought of making the most out of this situation. Her daughters take care of the store when she is working. This is a good way of taking care of the family\u2019s economy, since neighbors and friends visit the store regularly, which has resulted so far in good income. Given the good acceptance, she plans to buy more merchandise. By investing, she will be able to strengthen the store\u2019s position in the future and turn it into a good source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe plans, in the long term, to buy a vehicle in which she can transport the merchandise from the country side into the city and in that way reduce the final cost. This will result in better profits. This will be her fourth credit with MFP. She feels satisfied with what she has achieved so far, and with the loan, she expects to keep growing, for the community\u2019s sake. She enjoys being part of the communal bank, because her group is composed of old acquaintances, which makes her feel confident.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 3500 nuevos soles [PEN] to buy merchandise for her store, like essential supplies and beverages in bulk."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":1236221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy essential supplies and beverages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":384.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":383.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":421.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":435.86},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":450.2},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":453.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":479.93},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":491.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.76},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.12},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":148.18,"local_amount":384.16,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":388.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188859,"comment":null},{"amount":147.81,"local_amount":383.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":387.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572756,"comment":null},{"amount":162.76,"local_amount":421.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":426.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122421,"comment":null},{"amount":168.11,"local_amount":435.86,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":440.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868241,"comment":null},{"amount":173.65,"local_amount":450.2,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":454.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577060,"comment":null},{"amount":174.75,"local_amount":453.06,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":457.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529356,"comment":null},{"amount":185.12,"local_amount":479.93,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":484.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974477,"comment":null},{"amount":189.62,"local_amount":491.61,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":496.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995910,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T23:09:49Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496685,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa, 48, is a widow with two children and lives at West Point.

She is 24 years of age and lives with her husband and one son, age 2 months, and one daughter, age 5 years, who has just started schooling in the village school.\r\n\r\nPadmini is running a photo studio in a very small room in her house with the help of her husband. She has a computer system, a digital still photo camera and a normal video camera for her business. Her husband mainly manages the photo studio. In the absence of her husband, Padmini also takes photographs. Apart from in door service, her husband also attends calls and orders at various social festivals, government programmes and other functions as a photographer. She also gives the video camera on hire basis at a cost of 1,000 INR per day. \r\n\r\nIn normal season (from June to September) Padmini earns 5,000 INR per month, and in festive season (from October to May) she earns 8,000 to 10,000 INR per month. \r\n\r\nThe locality of Padmini has a great potential for her business but, due to shortage of space, she is not able to expand it as she would like. By using the present loan, Padmini is planning to purchase an advance digital camera for her business. From the extra income, she has a plan to construct a separate photo studio on her plot, which she wants to materialize very soon. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of her group are Santoshini, Pankajini, Tikini and Surangi, who are doing milk businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for purchasing of a digital camera.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Chhatapipal, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santoshini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tikini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surangi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pankajini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":64000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-18T01:20:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496769,"name":"Stanley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stanley is a water vendor in Mombasa, Kenya.

Now she has two cows producing eight liters of milk per day. Nepura supplies this milk to a traditional milk-processing unit of her village at 20 INR per liter.

is Helen; she previously accessed a 10,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts, accessories and to maintain her pedicab. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children and for their personal, house hold and business expenses. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 10,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and to maintain her pedicab. Her profits from her business will definitely help her sustain her family's daily needs and cover the educational expenses of her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nHelen hopes to expand her business in the coming years and dreams to give her children a good and quality education.

All the four members of this group are women from the village Kurebhana and belong to the below poverty line category. Kurebhana is a remote village in the district of Bolangir of Odisha, one of the poorest districts in India. A majority of the inhabitants of this village depend upon cultivation. In this village, almost all families are in the milk business. \r\n\r\nDukha is one of the members of Maa Santoshi group who has raised her hand second from right in the photo. She is 43 years old and is a straightforward lady, living with her husband, three sons age 24, 22 and 18 and one daughter, age 20. All her children have dropped out of school after secondary education and are helping their parents in farming. \r\n\r\nThe primary work of Dukha is farming from which she gets a low return with which it is very difficult to maintain her family. So she started a milk business for extra income with the help of her husband in the year 2009 by purchasing a cow from a loan availed from Mahashakti Foundation. Now she has three cows producing 10 liters of milk per day. \r\n\r\nDukha supplies this milk to a milk-processing unit of her village at 20 INR per liter. She gets the price of milk in every 10 days. As there is growing demand for milk in the locality, Dukha has planned to use the present loan for purchasing another cow of improved variety. Dukha has a dream to save some money for the marriages of her children and construct a house.\r\n\r\nThe other three members, Bilasini, Nalini and Anandini, are doing milk, vegetable and grocery store businesses. Since inception Dukha has been managing the group with utmost sincerity with good name and fame in her locality.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1236813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kurebhana, Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-11-17T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-17T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nalini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dukha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":88000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-11-17T18:32:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":496843,"name":"Rose Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose Marie is 27 years old, married with three children.

The couple have two children who are 22 and 9 years old.  They live in their own home which is located in an indigenous community in the central jungle.  Silvia is a woman who works hard to realize her dreams.  She started farming when she was 18 years old.  She and her husband have learned how to work the land and produce crops.  The crops they grow are coffee, ginger, citrus fruits and beans.  \"I like to grow everything so that I have income year round\", she says.\r\n\r\nSilvia's sales center is located 20 minutes from her community and so she doesn't experience any problems in getting there.  She says that fertilizers are the most expensive part of her business, as well as paying workers to take care of and harvest her crops.  However, in spite of all this Silvia remains committed to her business.  She is currently planning to plant more coffee and already has a nursery ready for this.

She lives an independent life and is a single mother of two daughters who are her reason for living. She is also proud of having achieved the construction of her own home of good materials from a young age. Her first agricultural activities, specifically the production of cocoa and coffee, were done with her parents. Later, she inherited plots that had always supported her ancestors. Thanks to this, for the last 20 years, she has been able to forge an independent life for the sake of her daughters.\r\n\r\nShe likes to work in the field since doing good work during the season results in the corresponding product leaving a good profit, as in the case of organic cocoa. However the issue of transportation of the sacks of dry cocoa ready for distribution has not been resolved properly.

","en":"Shahlo is a young mother with one child. Due to unfortunate circumstances, she divorced her husband. Currently, Shahlo lives with her mother and works as a waitress at a resort. \r\n\r\nShahlo first turned to MDO Arvand, LLC for a loan when she operated a small retail stall near a regional hospital, selling food to the hospital's visitors and patients. Since then, Shahlo has found another job, also related to retail, and now earns a very good income. She is requesting this loan to repair her apartment, which is in need of a renovation. Shahlo plans to use the loan to purchase building materials. \r\n\r\nPrevious loans from MDO Arvand have been very helpful to Shahlo and she expresses her gratitude for their financial

He's 36 years old and has five children aged 12, 14, 16, 18 and 19 years. He's a farmer by trade and grows corn and beans. He has gotten five years' worth of experience without any academic knowledge. He first started working on his father's land at age 12. That's how he acquired experience, since he needed to become independent from his parents and look for a way to provide food for his family. He currently gets help from his children and he sells his produce in the same district where he lives. His expectation is to increase production so that he can improve his family's living conditions.\r\nJuan requests the loan in order to purchase a cow and the rest of it is for purchasing supplies such as compost and fertilizer. That will help him to maintain his crop and increase its production, so he can offer his customers high quality produce at good

He started his business activity by running a butcher shop, but now operates his own kebab cafe in his yard. For this, Hrachik has constructed a few buildings in his yard: the open-air cafe is located on the second floor, with several small gazebos placed around it on the ground. The cafe is located near the Kapan-Kadzharan highway, and so Hrachik's main customers are truck drivers, as well as Kapan's residents. Hrachik would like to use the building's main floor, which is protected from the elements, to serve his customers in wintertime, thereby increasing his family's income.\r\n\r\nHrachik has received four loans from Nor Horizon. This time, he is asking for a loan of $1,600 to open the cafe's main floor for business: perform necessary repairs and purchase new tables, chairs, and tableware.\r\n\r\nHrachik is 57 years old and he is a professional cook. He is married and has two children: a son and a daughter. Hrachik's wife takes care of the household and helps her husband in the kebab cafe. Their daughter is married and lives with her husband.

She leads an independent life alongside her family, which is made up of her parents and her siblings. She owns a house built of adobe blocks.\r\n\r\nShe grows organic cacao on several parcels that she rents for seasonal production. For the past year she has also been dedicating part of her capital to hiring laborers, who are a big help with the hard work in the fields. \r\n\r\nShe likes working in with agricultural products because they are sought after by the whole sale buyers. Even though she works on rented parcels, they still result in good earnings for her and her family. This despite that fact that sometimes rain and sudden changes in the weather force them to stop working, which puts them back considerably. \r\n\r\nAs with all farmers, she needs sufficient capital to cover the entire growing season until the harvest, processing, and sale of the product.  On her list of requirements is sacks of manure and money to pay her workers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to keep working at the same rhythm so that she can, in the future, buy her own parcel and continue working in this business. This is her first loan with Microfinzas Prisma. She is already grateful for the trust that has been shown her and she pledges to make her repayments punctually. She feels very comfortable with the way her communal bank works and promotes teamwork.\r\n\r\nThe 500.00 PEN (Peruvian nuevos soles) will compliment her working capital so she can buy inputs such as manure and also hire laborers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1236767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She is a good woman who is kind and determined. She is a single mother of six children who live independently of her. She has her own house where she has lived alone for a long time. Thanks to her work, she was able to educate and feed her children. Her children are now of legal age and help her with some of her expenses, but she still works a lot in order to pay her expenses. Juana's work mainly consists of selling groceries; she purchases wholesale and then sells at retail prices. She obtains good profits that surpass her original investment. The business is located in her house and she has been running it for more than ten years. Occasionally she generates income by working as a seamstress - repairing garments or creating her own designs. She also makes a living by breeding pigs and selling them when they reach the ideal weight.\r\n\r\nShe likes her grocery business because it allows her to be in contact with her customers and distribute her time so she can do all the other work that is necessary for maintaining her finances. She hopes to continue with her growing business in this way and expand her workspace.\r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

Her values were instilled by her mother and today she does the same with her little children. She has a small shirt-sewing workshop which she has had for some time. She decided to start this business after being laid off by a business and that was when she began to be a micro-entrepreneur and became her own boss.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for from Fodemi will allow her to buy a larger quantity of cloth (in rolls) now that the Christmas season is approaching. For her, this is a good opportunity to gain more clients and promote her shirt designs to the entire town.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's dream is to have a large designing and tailoring workshop for casual and athletic clothing so she could provide work for the people in her neighborhood who need it, as well as help her home economically. She also dreams of improving her quality of life and providing her two little children with a good education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1236967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with four children, all of whom go to school. She has no additional family members. She sells Irish potatoes. She also gets an additional income from selling fruits at the market. She has been in this business for the past 6 years. She works six days a week. She has requested for a loan of Uganda Shillings 400,000 from MCDT SACCO to buy more bags of Irish potatoes to sell. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality.

lives in Kampala, Uganda. She is married with four children and all her children go to school. She takes care of additional family members (two sisters). She sells charcoal at the market on a retail basis. She also gets additional income from selling secondhand clothes. She has been in this business for the last 1 year. She works seven days a week.  \r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of Uganda shillings 1,000,000 from MCDT \u2013 SACCO to buy bags of charcoal.
