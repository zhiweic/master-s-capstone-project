Several times, she has requested loans from local financial institutions for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were rejected each time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for the family is the small monthly refugee pension from the local government and the monthly salary earned by Manana\u2019s nephew, who works as a mini-bus driver locally. Besides, Manana works as daily worker seasonally. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start a clothing sales business. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with reasonable conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. Manana will purchase clothes at wholesale prices and resell them in her district for a profit.

works for RESTIO ENERGY, a Barefoot Power distributor in South Africa. \n\nThis is his story: \n\nRESTIO ENERGY Company is a registered company and a leading energy for development consultancy, based in Somerset West, South Africa. The company was founded in 2001 and has since led and participated in numerous consultancy and project development initiatives across the SACD and East African region. RESTIO is understanding energy poverty and developing sustainable solutions to address these realities. RESTIO works principally in the \u2018off-grid\u2019 and \u2018low-income\u2019 sector covering the fields of renewable energy and liquid fuels for both electric power and thermal energy in order to provide these communities with access to an integrated and sustainable energy solution.\n\nRESTIO ENERGY was set up by Robert. He is a leading development consultant in the African renewable energy industry with specializations in sustainable energy service business models, the productive use of renewable energy, energy and development programme evaluations, and energy project feasibility studies. He has worked with a host of development organizations, including the World Bank, United Nations, Millennium Challenge Account, GVEP-I and GIZ. He holds an MSc degree in Environmental Change and Management from the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, as well as a Master of Social Science degree in Social Anthropology. He also serves on the Consumer Working Group of the Global Cookstove Alliance.\n\nThe need for affordable and clean energy among the South Africans not connected to the grid in the townships was the idea behind starting RESTIO and the commitment to promoting original, financially sustainable and accessible solutions to a range of energy related problems and challenges. According to Robert, \u201cWe understand that energy is an essential element in achieving sustainable development and we aim to understand and address the obstacles impeding the successful delivery. We focus on a broad range of market opportunities, from working with those facing energy poverty to more mainstream opportunities in commercial, agricultural and industrial arenas. Working with a client profile including private, public and non-governmental organizations, we develop, promote and distribute energy solutions that inform, present income-generating opportunities, and offer convenience and value for money.\n\n\"We aim to reduce the use of candles and paraffin lanterns, which will in turn reduce accidental fires as well as accidental ingestion of paraffin. We also believe that current illumination options, in addition to the dangers, are more expensive in the long-run than Barefoot Power products.\" \n\nImportantly, the presence and use of Barefoot Power products within these rural households will provide an invaluable demonstration of the effectiveness and performance of PV-based lighting products in communities where such products currently have very little traction. This will be used to further stimulate the demand for these products.\n\nThe loan will be used toward the cost of procurement of 1,800 Firefly Mobile Lamps from Barefoot Power. This will assist with the cash flow requirements for the purchase and distribution of the Firefly Mobile Lamps to individuals and communities in six provinces in South Africa, supported by a government contract through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR). Through it, RESTIO will be in a position to reach 1,700 people in remote areas through a coordinated formal distribution as dictated by the DRDLR.\n\nIn order for the Firefly Mobile Lamps to become increasingly accessible to all markets, RESTIO requires economies of scale, so the more people who benefit from the use thereof, the more this will contribute to RESTIO building a sustainable mode of distribution in order to grow the market.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":16200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":16200,"image":{"id":1253984,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2814,"youtubeId":"4k1YhPGcd8c","title":"Kiva Borrower

Besides this, Koba grows potatoes and carrots on his agricultural land. He is a very hard-working man, with a rich experience in his work. Koba is requesting credit to start-up a trade business. His loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative from Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credit on soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Koba will purchase a mini-bus to trade his harvested potatoes. This will save the costs of transportation. Besides this, he will purchase various greengrocery products from local farmers at wholesale prices and sell them in nearby towns with a price mark-up. This new business initiative will increase Koba's monthly income.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nJosephine operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and meats cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJosephine hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams to have a good life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. There she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

and his wife Gilaine moved from Mexico City to America looking for new opportunities and a better quality of life for their family. After only six months, Eric found himself unemployed after being laid off from the job that brought him to the US. Despite having a long work history with companies such as Microsoft, 3M and Time, he struggled to find work and took it as an opportunity to start his own business.\r\n\r\nIn October 2012, Eric and Gilaine started Llama Ink, a home-based digital printing company offering custom prints on any type of fabric.  With an enormous database of fun and innovative graphics, Llama Ink offers hundreds of pre-made custom design options for t-shirts, hoodies and tote bags. The company\u2019s vision is to dress people with innovative products made in the USA, allowing them to express themselves in a fun and creative way, while supporting the local economy. \r\n\r\nLacking the capital needed to get their company fully operational, the couple sought help from Accion San Diego, a local microlender.  Despite having no credit history, Eric was able to secure a $5,000 Kiva loan to be used to purchase equipment and invest in marketing and inventory. \r\n\r\nWhat Eric and Gilaine love most about their new venture is that it allows them to express their creativity, while working from home with their children. They hope to grow their business to the point where they can create new jobs, helping others who are where they once were. They also would like to give back to their community by donating a shirt for every shirt sold.  \r\n\r\nFind Llama Ink online at:

is from a small village in the Khashuri district. He is 28 years old, single and lives with his sister, brother and parents. Shota and his brother are electricians and receive small monthly salaries. The family is involved in an agricultural business. In particular, Shota runs a small dairy farm; he has a calf and two milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. In addition, he grows maize and haricots on the family-owned land. The harvested products, as well as the cheese, are sold at the local open market.

(Compound #3). He is 37 years old, a high school graduate, and has been managing his business since 2006. He has been successful with his business, which has enabled him to buy a piece of land and build a shop. Since his demand is increasing, he is requesting a loan to buy more fashionable clothes, rice by the bag, soft drinks by the crate, Argo-oil by the gallon, etc. to meet his customer's demands. His passion has increased over the years because his shop is the shopping place for the people of Compound #3.

This was the main reason for her decision to open a shop at home, because before, she worked on a market stall.  \r\nHowever, she has plans to increase her stock of products and to run parallel to this business, a soda fountain.  Therefore, this will be loan number 3 with the institution MFP. She feels pleased with the opportunity offered to her; to be able to count on working capital. She wants to be able to continue to rely on this support, and for this reason, she promises to be punctual with the payments.

Se decidi\u00f3 por \u00e9sta actividad por la necesidad de tener un oficio para contar con un ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los gastos del su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, adem\u00e1s de poder manejar su propio horario de trabajo.

He lives with Arita, who is a shopkeeper, and mother to his three children, who are 21, 18 and 10 years old. He lives comfortably in his own home, in the company of his partner and children, whom he loves very much, and who are his motivation in life. Cesar works repairing mobile phones of all the different makes. Every morning, at 5 am, he goes to market number 2, where he has a small stand, and where he serves his customers warmly. He has been running this business for more than 6 years. He can count on the help of a friend, when he has a lot of repairs to do, and in this way, he can deliver all of the mobiles on time.\r\nHe likes his business because it keeps him busy, and allows him to make use of what he has learnt at training school. He decided upon this business because of the necessity of having a trade, in order to be able to rely upon an income, to cover the costs of his home and the education of his children. Apart from that, he wanted to be able to be in control of his own working hours. On the other hand, Cesar comments that it is very inconvenient when his customers don\u2019t collect the mobile phones, that they have left for repair, on time.  This means that he has to store them, and they take up space in his store, which is very small.

She also has a lot of experience in business.  She lives with her partner, Gustavo, who works as a merchant, and their two children, ages 8 and 21.  Together they all live comfortably in their own home.\r\n\r\nLupe\u2019s business is selling fresh fish in the mornings that she buys from her city\u2019s fishing port.  She sells the fish as a travelling vendor using a tricycle equipped with a loudspeaker, which she uses to offer her products.  She uses the tricycle to transport her products through the streets of the settlements and new towns.  She also has a mototaxi that she rents to a driver for an average of 25 nuevos soles per day, in this way generating some additional income.\r\n\r\nLupe began her business more than three years ago with some of her own capital and then gradually expanded it with the help of loans.  Her partner also helps her with her sales.\r\n\r\nHer business generates profits for her as she generally sells everything she carries with her to sell.\r\n\r\nShe says that she decided to start her business because she needed a trade, since she does not have a profession.  She needs the money she earns from her business to pay for the education of her children, which she believes is the best inheritance she can leave them.  Moreover, compared to her previous work, her business earns her more profit each day.\r\n\r\nTherefore, given her positive results, she would like to continue earning a living with her business.  This will be her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and with their assistance she hopes to further her goals.  Moreover, she says she is happy with her communal bank because they are a committed and united team.\r\n\r\nLupe will use the requested 600 nuevos soles to buy fish in larger quantities and to repair her motocart."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1262739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a variety of fish in larger quantities and to repair her motocart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-23T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-22T12:40:01Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":94.74},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":98.72},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":107.02},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":110.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":89.17,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":95.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339573097,"comment":null},{"amount":39.48,"local_amount":94.74,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122739,"comment":null},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":98.72,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":105.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868564,"comment":null},{"amount":41.44,"local_amount":99.46,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":106.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577396,"comment":null},{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":107.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":114.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529633,"comment":null},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":110.89,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":118.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-23T19:07:13Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:20:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":510848,"name":"Luciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luciana is a woman of thirty-two years.

Taking this loan will create for Majdi another new path in his work, which will enable him to work extra hours and take additional requests, which will increase his income and improve the family's living conditions for the better.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Especially in the winter season, the house ceiling is leaking water and this has led to damage to the house and its furniture.

But due to their financial situation the family has not completed the extension and as winter comes to Mongolia, it will become a source of heat loss. So Bat is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to complete the extension. As a result, the family will be able to live in a warm and comfortable environment; furthermore they will burn less coal and thus contribute to efforts against air pollution."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2166.17,"image":{"id":1263200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to complete an extension to the family home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2012-12-24T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-23T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.83,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":396800},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":410060.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":426779.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":432543.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":445320.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":454589.05},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":433905.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":313.59},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.86},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.58},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":287.68,"local_amount":396800,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":398436.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339501222,"comment":null},{"amount":297.29,"local_amount":410060.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":411752.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347053385,"comment":null},{"amount":309.42,"local_amount":426779.82,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T12:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":428540.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355799131,"comment":null},{"amount":313.59,"local_amount":432543.81,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":434328.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364507483,"comment":null},{"amount":322.86,"local_amount":445320.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":447157.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372912644,"comment":null},{"amount":329.58,"local_amount":454589.05,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":456464.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381690297,"comment":null},{"amount":305.75,"local_amount":433905.84,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":435695.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":8.83,"payment_id":390553063,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-25T05:25:05Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T10:50:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":511261,"name":"Irum's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irum is a 34-year-old woman who lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband, daughter and son.

She is divorced and has five children.  She divorced 12 years ago and since then she has been fending for her five children alone.  With an aim to finding suitable work, several years ago she left for the Russian Federation.  There she worked and sent money home to her children.  Her children missed her very much and asked her to come home, because they didn't have anyone besides her.  \r\n\r\nMaysara returned to her homeland and started to look for work since caring for five children takes a lot of money.  She learned from her neighbors about a course called \"Attain Success,\" which is put on by the Association of Business Women and teaches women how to start their own businesses.  Maysara went through this training and got her graduation certificate.  She has owned her own business for six months now.  She owns a cafe.  Now, she wants to develop her business by installing an audio recorder and karaoke machine to attract more customers.  Using her profits, Maysara plans to provide her children with good educations and calorie-rich foods.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of 10,000 somoni (TJS) for the purchase for an audio recorder and karaoke machine in order to develop her new business.  She is relying on your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":890.13,"image":{"id":1263295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to

He is married and has three children.  They live in a large, traditional family in Kabo\u00efla I, a popular neighborhood of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nTahirou didn't have the opportunity to go to school.  He started buying and selling items at a young age.  For more than a year he has been buying and selling fuel (gas, diesel, lamp oil).  Tahirou has a sales location which is doing very well and he is very well liked by his customers.  Given the lack of resources, he sees himself as being unable to meet his customer demand which is continually growing.  For this reason, he joined Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution and his first loan will be used to boost his business.  This will allow him to better satisfy his customer demand and increase customer loyalty.\r\n\r\nTahirou will use this loan to buy six 20-liter containers of gas and eight 20-liter containers of diesel at the pump here in Sikasso in order to sell them retail to a customer base who mainly own two-wheeled vehicles.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Tahirou plans to make a monthly profit of 90,000 francs.  The income he makes from this business will allow him to repay his loan and meet his family's needs.  He will invest the rest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1263325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

is a 27-year-old single young man. He lives in Khan Younis in a small house. \r\n\r\nFor the past three years, Mohammad has had a cosmetics store which contains beauty products, perfumes and other cosmetics products. This store is a very successful project and earns a pretty good income, but some times it needs more liquidity to buy more products.\r\n\r\nMohammad took a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN. This loan will help Mohammad to buy more products for his store, which will increase his sales and therefore increase his income positively. This will ensure Mohammad a better future. \r\n\r\nMohammad appears in the photo. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending page:

is 44 years old and lives with his wife and three teenage children. He is a home-repair worker, but the main income of the family is from an agriculture business. For more than 21 years, he has run an agricultural business which includes cattle and milk cows, whose milk they use to make cheese and butter to sell. \r\n\r\nMirzali is a very hard-working and responsible man.

","en":"Dilshod always works very hard for the welfare of his family. He is 30 years old, married, and has 2 children. His wife Saodat is a stay-at-home mom. For over a year, Dilshod has been working in a manufacturing company that produces construction material such as tiles, glue, boards, and so on. His colleagues respect him a lot because he is an honest person. Every month when he receives his salary, he hurries to the store to go shopping. He spends all of his money just providing for his family. He is unable to save up to buy furniture and modern appliances for his home. With each passing year his children are getting older, and he has to meet their growing needs. Dilshod is seeking a loan in the amount of 3,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy household furnishings, particularly for his children. This loan will help him to create comfortable living conditions at home. Being a conscientious person, he promises to pay off the loan on time. He is waiting for your kindness.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1263336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer
