She lives in the city of Ica with her two small children who she loves and who are her main reason for living. She is a very friendly, hard working and enthusiastic person who strives to provide for her children since she is both their mother and father. Unfortunately, because of  a lack of financial resources and because she has had to work since she was very young, Rosa was not able to go to school to become a cosmetologist, something that she would have very much liked to do. In her free time, she likes to listen to music and sometimes she likes to spoil her children by making a delicious dish of carapulcra.\r\nOn her own initiative and with a lot of hard work and dedication, Rosa has a small business selling fruit. She sells different fruits depending on the season and works about 8 hours every day. Rosa thinks that things are going well because she offers affordable prices and friendly customer service.\r\nRosa is very grateful for the Kiva micro loans as they have helped her to buy larger quantities and different varieties of fruit such as mangoes, apples, grapes, etc.  She has also been able to stock her business and serve her customers better and therefore, continue working and striving for her biggest dream, owning her own home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1307315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Nwxsha is one of many Iraqi women working from home, using her sewing skills to generate some income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.<p>\r\n\r\nNwxsha has five years of experience with her small, home-based sewing and tailoring business. She makes dresses for women and children as well as small fabric household items. She would like to improve the services she can offer her customers and would like to purchase an over machine. She would also like to be able to work more hours and actually be in more control of planning her work time. To do so she would like to buy a small generator which will allow her to work even during the hours of the frequent, random power cuts in the city. To be able to pay for these plans, she has requested a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.<p>\r\n\r\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"Group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor - thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

Although he didn't have the capital he needed to invest, he did not let this hold him back.  He requested a loan and started his business.  He has been working in his business for five years now.\r\n\r\nOne of the main advantages that Jefferson's business has is its location as it is near a number of educational institutions which means he earns more income.

Maura farms for a living, growing vegetables such as rue, oregano, and chamomile, which are plants that do not need much tending, investment, or time.  \r\n\r\nShe says that her business is constant, as every time her crops get big, she cuts them, ties them in small bundles, and sells them for 50 cents each.  She also tells us that growing this kind of plant is simpler because when they grow, you can cut them and they grown back, so you do not have to spend money on fertilizers and labor, among other things that were a constant concern for her in years past.  Furthermore, the profits she makes are worthwhile because she has reliable customers in the city of Lima, where she sells three bundles of rue or chamomile for 2 soles, which is double the price in Tarma.  This will be Maura's second loan with Kiva, whom she thanks for placing its trust in her.  She promises to make her payments on time.

She lives with her husband Romulo and their three children, whom she cares for in the house they have rented for five years.  In the morning she goes to her farming plots where she grows different produce, such as corn and potatoes, among others.  She tells us that her plots are several hours away walking, so she and her husband work in shifts so as not to leave their children unattended.  She says that she raises her cows and plants her crops in the higher region, but that soon she will start to harvest, so she needs working capital.  She also plans to increase her livestock, which consists of chickens and cows, which she fattens over a period of a few months and then sells for twice the price.  This is her first loan with Kiva and she is thankful for the financial help she is receiving.  She promises to make her payments on time.  Cirila will use the 1,000 soles to buy animals, such as chickens and a cow, to increase her livestock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1307689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens and a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":112.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":115.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":121.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":128.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":132.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":139.15},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":144.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":105.82,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":109.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869061,"comment":null},{"amount":44.84,"local_amount":112.11,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":116.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577902,"comment":null},{"amount":46.39,"local_amount":115.96,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":120.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530132,"comment":null},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":121.35,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975163,"comment":null},{"amount":51.46,"local_amount":128.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":133.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996429,"comment":null},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":132.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":137.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399863910,"comment":null},{"amount":55.66,"local_amount":139.15,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":144.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352327,"comment":null},{"amount":57.84,"local_amount":144.59,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":150.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904217,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-08T05:18:18Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T17:54:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534815,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natividad, who is married and works hard to support her family, has a tobacco retail business in the Philippines.

This will be of great importance to take advantage of this to improve the walls of his house a little because they are deteriorated, and he will give them a little plastering, since it is beyond his means to rebuild them.\r\n\r\nHe appreciates CEPRODEL and Kiva because they continue to give him a friendly hand to continue forward in his family life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":296.12,"image":{"id":1307247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy cement and sand and pay for labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T02:50:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donald Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":427.22},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":713.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":730.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":771.87},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":793.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":826.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":868.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":896.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":939.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":973.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1014.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1044.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.05},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.12},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.37},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.16,"local_amount":427.22,"processed_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":441.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494176,"comment":null},{"amount":30.32,"local_amount":713.58,"processed_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":736.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115467,"comment":null},{"amount":31.05,"local_amount":730.46,"processed_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":754.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675115,"comment":null},{"amount":32.8,"local_amount":771.87,"processed_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":796.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539394,"comment":null},{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":793.13,"processed_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":818.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788631,"comment":null},{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":826.21,"processed_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":853.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410064953,"comment":null},{"amount":36.91,"local_amount":868.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:23:35Z","rounded_local_amount":896.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419828837,"comment":null},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":896.9,"processed_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":926.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384623,"comment":null},{"amount":39.94,"local_amount":939.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":970.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-18T16:55:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534850,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Aida, age 33 and a resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines.

The loan will be used to purchase and stock more drugs to sell, and will help her to generate greater profits, expand the business and afford medical expenses. She hopes that in the future she will be able to increase her working capital. \r\n\r\nAssunta is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Patrick who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":762.24,"image":{"id":1307008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kinobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T16:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T16:20:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176246},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182612},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":189208},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":196042},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":203123},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":210459},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":218061},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":225937},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":234098},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":242553},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":251559}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.19},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":64.64,"local_amount":170102,"processed_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T11:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":171081.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355772739,"comment":null},{"amount":66.97,"local_amount":176246,"processed_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177261.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364880032,"comment":null},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":182612,"processed_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T08:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":183663.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372885750,"comment":null},{"amount":71.9,"local_amount":189208,"processed_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":190297.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381908232,"comment":null},{"amount":74.5,"local_amount":196042,"processed_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":197171.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391396513,"comment":null},{"amount":77.19,"local_amount":203123,"processed_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":204293.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399776091,"comment":null},{"amount":79.97,"local_amount":210459,"processed_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-24T08:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":211671.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411560350,"comment":null},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":218061,"processed_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":219317.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420923272,"comment":null},{"amount":85.86,"local_amount":225937,"processed_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":227238.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429469896,"comment":null},{"amount":88.96,"local_amount":234098,"processed_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T09:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":235446.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440155634,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-20T00:56:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534967,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James, 29 years old, is married to Jecinta and the father of one child.

Unurbat, 31 years old, lives with his son and wife in Ulaanbaatar, capital city of Mongolia. His wife has a position in logistics monitoring professionals in the air traffic industry. His son goes to kindergarten. He himself has been working as a senior professional at the department of information and advertisement in the free trade zone. The apartment the family live in has been flooded with rain numerous times due to its weak ceiling. Also because of vulnerable windows and walls, the family is chilled to their core in winter time. \n\nFor these reasons, Mr. Unurbat is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as wallpaper, vacuum insulated windows, ceilings and fiber glass for insulation and repair of the house. As a result, the family will be able to live in a warm and comfortable place in winter. The renovated house will have the benefit of not losing its heat and thus preserving energy. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for a better future.

years old, married, and raising two children. Her older son is studying at university, and her daughter goes to school. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Kadyira began in 1995 to engage in raising livestock and growing crops. Having started this business with three heifers for 9,000 KGS, through hard work Kadyira today has on her farm two cows, one calf, and a horse, which bring in a monthly profit of 12,000 som. Concluding that this business is profitable, Kadyira approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep for fattening and resale, and a cow to increase revenues through selling milk. \r\n\r\nKadyira plans to invest income from the loan to further expand her farm.

This will provide them with more security and well-being so that Milagros can continue working and making an effort towards her dream of owning a furniture store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.84,"image":{"id":1307895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase materials to plaster and paint her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pisco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176.52},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":180.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189.94},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":194.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":202.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":218.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":228.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":235.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":245.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":255.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.78,"local_amount":160.97,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":162.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483334,"comment":null},{"amount":68.84,"local_amount":176.52,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":178.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372889371,"comment":null},{"amount":70.35,"local_amount":180.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381664271,"comment":null},{"amount":150.04,"local_amount":384.73,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":389.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390775579,"comment":null},{"amount":220.88,"local_amount":566.37,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":573.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819124,"comment":null},{"amount":25.94,"local_amount":66.49,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":67.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472105,"comment":null},{"amount":89.01,"local_amount":228.21,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":230.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694625,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-10T23:13:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":534974,"name":"Yuriy","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439  -

He would like to invest in the purchase of materials such as marble and glue, as well as tools like a diamond saw, sand paper, and brushes.\r\n\r\nHector has been selling through NOVICA since 2011. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"When I was 14, I met a person who worked sculpting marble. I started to work with him, and I liked it. When I was 16, I started working on my own.

Velikaya Znamenka.  This has been his business for 28 years.  Currently, he lives with his wife and youngest daughter in the home they own.  The income from his garden is around 130,000 grivens.  He mostly grows tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and grapes.  Vladimir's farm is large, and he does everything himself.  It's clear that he understands the value of money.  This winter, heavy snowfall caused one of his greenhouses to collapse and it now urgently needs to be restored.  Vladimir remembers the night it happened, he didn't sleep for fear the structures couldn't withstand the weight of the snow.

Altantuya is 45 years old and lives with her husband and four-year-old daughter in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Her husband is an electrician and gem cutter but currently unemployed. She herself has been working as a chairman at one branch of a building company. Also she rents a 54-square-meter field to a cosmetic product selling company. The house the family lives in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. So she is requesting a loan of 2,600,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as fiberglass, bricks, concrete and planks. As a result, the family can live in a comfortable and warm place. In addition, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal thus contributing to the efforts against air pollution by emitting less smoke. The borrower is a very hardworking and trustworthy individual who cares deeply for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275.57,"image":{"id":1307371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase insulation and building materials such as fiberglass and bricks to repair their home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2013-03-08T21:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-07T21:40:07Z","loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":74.4,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altantuya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178133.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":194031.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":197145.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":204202.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":204762.45},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":216240.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":220457.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":224135.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":232849.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":237439.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":243819.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":246783.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.46},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.93},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.26},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.46,"local_amount":178133.33,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":178880.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364507622,"comment":null},{"amount":139.93,"local_amount":194031.47,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":194845.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372912784,"comment":null},{"amount":142.17,"local_amount":197145.49,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":197972.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381690432,"comment":null},{"amount":143.9,"local_amount":204202.07,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":205059.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":390553203,"comment":null},{"amount":132.9,"local_amount":204762.45,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":205621.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.77,"payment_id":399802223,"comment":null},{"amount":144.36,"local_amount":216240.64,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":217148.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":11.58,"payment_id":410078237,"comment":null},{"amount":141.78,"local_amount":220457.4,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":221382.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.2,"payment_id":419844677,"comment":null},{"amount":148.26,"local_amount":224135.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":225075.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.38,"payment_id":429493591,"comment":null},{"amount":153.81,"local_amount":232849.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":233826.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.11,"payment_id":439717729,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-12T20:42:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":535159,"name":"Sernalin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sernalin works hard to support her family.

Velikaya Znamenka for 23 years.  She, her husband and son all help out with the farming duties.  The income from their garden is around 120,000 grivens.  They grow tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes.  Galina has lived her whole life in Velikaya Znamenka, once working on a farm as a milkmaid, then in the cafeterias of state farms, and only began seriously farming her own land when she could find no more work.

Due to this, they set up the business once again, which consists of selling fried plantains and cashew nuts. \r\n\r\nThey travel three times a week to the city's market, which is 20 kilometers from their home, to buy plantains, cashews, oil and plastic bags to store the nuts and the plantains. Regarding the nuts, they buy them in large quantities and store them, since they are a seasonal product and they have to store quite a lot in order to satisfy the demand throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting from the Campo Foundation is to buy a greater quantity of cashews. Since Jos\u00e9's wife has been sick, they found themselves without cash to buy the nuts, although it is the production season for this crop. Thus, they need the money in order to buy a lot.

After becoming married, Umeda started to look for work in her field since she graduate from Tajik State University where she majored in economics.  Her efforts were in vain.  She was very excited to find out about the course \"Bring It On\" offered by the Association of Business Women.  She successfully participated in the course and received a certificate.  She wants to start her own business, buying and selling women's underwear at a mall.  She is the sole proprietor of her business since her husband Bajrom works in construction and is very busy.  She's asking for a loan of 3000 American dollars to buy women's underwear in order to start her own business.

The oldest is a high school student.  For eight years she has worked selling basic grains and new clothing inside her home and also as a street vendor.  For now she has generally placed all of her merchandise, that is to say, sold the new clothing and is waiting to receive her payments for this product so at this time she has no product in her home.  She started this business on her own initiative with the help of her parents after being left alone facing the care of her children, since she needed to find a way to subsist and to have an economic income and give to her children what they need.  \n\nTomasa is requesting the loan because she plans to continue investing in basic grains since she has to satisfy the influx of customers.

A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit.  Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and this profit is the dealer's  income.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php10, 000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy additional supplies and merchandise products like shampoo, cologne, deodorant, perfume, soap, fabric softener, undergarments and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to have more products to sell and dreams of giving her children a good future and education. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week.   She also draws strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1307463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"

She is married to Joseph, a seaman. Prescilla manages their household while operating a business. She and her husband are working hard to provide income for their family's everyday needs.\r\n\r\nPrescilla maintains a direct-selling business. She sells different health products and apparel from Purple Networx. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with one month to pay. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and the difference provides the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and residents of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Prescilla is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan to buy purple corn juice, optimum cleanse, optimum power, and different apparel as well as additional supplies and merchandise. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPrescilla hopes to expand her business and dreams that her youngest child will finish his studies. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance
