Rani continues her weaving business in this manner, and now she is acknowledged to be one of the successful unmarried females in the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nRani joined a monthly savings group with the local money investment group, and she will get her savings at the end of every 12 months.

Due to his hard work, he managed to save some money and bought a piece of land in Rwabarata, where he planted a banana plantation.

47-year-old Mariama from Torkpoi town in Bo. She is married with five children between the ages of 8 and 27 years. Three of her children are currently attending school. In 1989, Mariama established her palm oil business. She began her business because she needed a source of income to support herself. She works at the business eight hours a day and six days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the poor road network within her area of operation.\r\n\r\nMariama requires a loan in order to buy local foodstuffs like gari and palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to have a permanent business location and improve her family's welfare. In the future, Mariama plans to open a palm oil store.

For the seafood, she buys about 30 pounds of shrimp and 8 pounds of fish.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from Fundacion Campo is to buy more seafood and the ingredients for the chicken and grilled beef. She will buy beverages and three more sets of utensils. She needs to make the investment, given that Holy Week is getting close in the country, and this time of year is really good for her.

She is an energetic lady of 23 years who lives with her husband and only son, three years old \r\n\r\nSasmita is has been running a silver jewelry shop in her house for the last two years. Her husband is running a utensils-selling business by moving to nearby villages and weekly markets via a moped. Previously, he was running a utensils shop in a cabin but due to lack of capital, he could not continue the same successfully. So Sasmita formed this group and took a loan of 14,000 INR from Mahashakti Foundation to invest in her business. She added another 36,000 INR from their savings and with a capital of 50,000 INR, gave a new look to the present business. They started two businesses. One is silver jewelry selling at the home for her and the other is the utensils business for her husband for mobile vending. As Sasmita had experience managing a similar type of business from her parental house, she is successfully managing her jewelery shop. Sasmita\u2019s family earns a daily net income of 500 INR from the existing two businesses. Out of this income, she has been able to manage her household expenses in a decent manner. Sasmita buys the jewelry as well as the utensils from the local wholeseller twice a month. With the present loan, Sasmita wants to increase the stock of utensils by purchasing in bulk. This will help her to reduce the purchasing cost as she replenishes her stock frequently. Sasmita hopes to save enough money to provide better education to her only child and build a house for her own.\r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Anusaya, Tikina, Ramakumari and Gori who are successfully running small enterprises.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T05:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anusaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tikina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramakumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T18:42:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541105,"name":"Maha Laxmi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muniguda is a small town where Radhamani, a widow age 51, is residing with her son of 31 years and a daughter of 21 years of age. Muniguda is situated in the Rayagada district of northern Odisha, India. The government has declared Rayagada as a backward district in Odisha state. Tribal people are the primitive community of this area. They depend on agro-forestry products. So some people have migrated from the coastal belt to this area to earn their livelihood by adopting some business. The family of Radhamani, the featured member standing on the extreme left with her hand raised, also migrated from another district to Muniguda and started a general grocery shop. Seven years ago, her husband, Trinath, died due to illness. She could not give him the appropriate treatment due to her poor income. After her husband\u2019s death, she started making leaf plates and sold them in the market. Her son runs his father\u2019s shop but their income is not sufficient to manage their family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Radhamani formed a Joint liability group in the year 2010 with five women in her locality, named Maha Laxmi to get a business loan from Mahashakti Foundation. In the first loan, she got 12,000 rupees and as she has experience stitching from her parent\u2019s house, she purchased a sewing machine. She started stitching ladies and gents dresses. In the second loan, she got an 18000\/- loan from Mahashakti and purchased a Pico machine to help her in tailoring work. Her income gradually increased . In the meantime, her son married. This is the third loan for Radhamani and with this loan she is planning to purchase some new cloth to sell and stitch. Now she is very happy. She is maintaining a peaceful and pleasant life with her son, daughter and daughter in law. She has a dream of marrying her daughter to a good businessman. She is improving her business to realize her cherished dream. \r\n\r\nThe other four members of the group are Rina, Sasmita, Subasini, and Sushama.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase clothes to sell and stitch","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Muniguda,Rayagada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Radhamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sushama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sasmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T02:30:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541111,"name":"Champeswar Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Champeswar is a Joint Liability Group formed in the year 2009 by five active women entrepreneurs of Bhawanipatna town in Kalahandi district of Odisha, India to request a loan from Mahashakti Foundation to expand their existing businesses.

As time went on, Luis married and had his own family but he continued working alongside his father.  By now he had a dream of opening his own ironmongery and welding workshop so for many years Luis and his wife went without certain things as they saved up money to start a business.  Luis started off with just equipment for welding and repairing metal doors but his business has grown a lot since he started the business nine years ago.

The lady standing second from left in the sky color sari with raised hand is Rebati.  She lives with her husband and two sons, age 29 and 20. She is very energetic, hardworking and enthusiastic and she always devotes her efforts to get her family ahead. \r\n \r\nFor 20 years, Rebati has been running a general shop. Initially, she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potato, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually, she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Now her son is looking after the business. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2009, Rebati, along with three other women of her locality, formed a Joint Liability Group named Mahalaxmi-1 and took a loan from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their business. All members hail from poor backgrounds in the Below Poverty Line category. This is the third loan of her group. \r\n\r\nDuring the last three loans, Rebati has been able to add some grocery items like dough, oil, spices, etc. Now she is earning 500 INR daily from her business. Rebati wants to keep more stock for her shop, but due to financial scarcity, her son has to go to the nearest market to buy items for her grocery shop regularly. Due to frequent purchases, she incurs losses due to transportation costs. So from the present loan she has planned to buy in bulk merchandise for her business such as rice, sugar, oil, noodles, potato, onion, dough, etc. She expects to increase her sales and thereby her income for her overall development. Rebati hopes to build a permanent house for her family and get her sons married. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Padmalaya, Binodini and Purnima running tailoring center, auto repairing center and betel nut shop respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for purchasing rice, sugar, oil, noodles, potato, onion, dough, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bhawanipatna,Kalahandi,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T14:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T14:00:01Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Binodini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Purnima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmalaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":48000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":48000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T13:11:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541327,"name":"Enriqueta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Enriqueta works hard to support her family.

She's married and has five children.  Two are school-aged.  Her spouse works building and repairing homes and only works seasonally. Odina herself worked for many years on a dairy farm.  During the recent, worldwide crisis, her wages were at first withheld, and then she was laid off all together.  She was one of the farm's best workers, sometimes milking up to one hundred liters.  It was difficult for her to part with her cow, she had bonded with them.  It was, however, inevitable.  \n\nShe has quite a bit of experience with livestock. After she was laid off, she began breeding cows on her land.  At first it was difficult, but with time, it became easier.  Her older children help her with the work.  Her neighbor told her about Arvand and she came in for a loan.  With the funds, she will buy livestock.  She is very grateful to Arvand for the support and she plans on further collaboration.

He has made many sales since he has been able to create a new market for keychains.  \r\n\r\nThe borrower works alone and receives help from no one.  He begins his work selling keychains at 8:00 A.M. and finishes at 8:00 P.M.  The difficulties that he must face in his work include dealing with his disability (he is blind) and the occasional customer who pays with counterfeit money.

The borrower is not married and has no children.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, the borrower will buy keychains and other items so that he can increase his business.  As a result, he will earn more income.  His goals for the future include being healthy, improving his financial situation, and having a house of his own.

What she basically does is buy biscuits from a wholesaler, then sell them to customers with a profit. She also has a direct selling business for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nEugenia dreams to have a room for all her products and have more customers.

Her family lives in a house with a thatch roof located in Battambang province's Moung Russey district and the main sources of her family's income are from farming rice and growing chilies. She has been running her business for 11 years, earning about 25,000 Riels (KHR) per day.\r\n\r\nShe has had five loans from Kiva's partner, VisionFund, and has effectively used them to sustain her family's business, support her family's needs and save some money from the earnings for the future.

Heb manages to earn about 70,000 Riels (KHR) per day to feed her family.\r\n\r\nHeb has taken out and completely repaid five loans through VisionFund. The loans have helped her better support her family with enough food.

She is a member of the Lomgoul Group. After her husband passed away, she moved back to her poor parents' home with her kids. Tragedy struck when her younger daughter was found drowned in the nearby pond, which shook Henei\u2019s life and became the reason to continue to live her life. Starting a new life without her husband and her deceased daughter wasn\u2019t easy at all, but her son would be an orphan if Henei lost hope and cursed herself for the plight she faces. Her son is the only reason why she is back in form to continue her life and start off the business to support her son and herself. Her group members also supported and encouraged her in all possible ways.\r\n\r\n Henei started her own business by selling cosmetic and grocery products.  She used to get the stock from the nearby Army canteen and sold it with a profit in the village and nearby markets. Her supplies consist of talcum powders, hair oils, detergent soaps, tooth-paste, milk powder, detergent powder, etc. With the little profit she made, she also started selling used clothes in her village and neighbouring villages. She gets the used clothes from the main town, which is about 30 kms from the village where she resides. \r\n\r\n With the extension of the loan from Kiva, Henei decided to get more used clothes from the main market consisting of  T-shirts, Medi-Pants, summer pants, shorts, and cotton shirts as she feels that summer is approaching and selling these items will bring more money. She will sell used clothes as well as continue stocking army canteen supplies for the villagers and the nearby shops.\r\n\r\nHenei's dream is to own a house of her own that she and her son can share without feeling any obligations towards anyone. Her community has shown her more support than she feels she and her son deserve. Thus, she is hopeful that with the loan, she will formulate a way to earn her monthly income and do some saving to let her dreams come true.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1318364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more used clothes for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-03-25T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-24T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hesen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatngah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoichingkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vahtin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phalneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-03-28T02:56:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":541430,"name":"Genie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Genie is 36 years old and lives in Libertad, Sapang Dalaga.

They sell their crop through various intermediaries who come to the community to acquire it.\r\n\r\nCurrently she's requesting help to buy fertilizer and manure for her coffee crop so she can keep it free of pests and diseases that destroy entire crops if not treated in time.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her crop to generate more income so she can continue investing in coffee production.  One of her greatest challenges is the constant increase and rise in prices of the very supplies that are a big help in guaranteeing a 100% crop.

The couple have 1 daughter, Lily, who is 30 years old.  They live together in their own home together with their two grandchildren who they love very much.  Tezalia's business is providing a passenger transport service with a motorcycle taxi that she bought with her savings.  When she first started out in this business she hired a motorcycle taxi.  She saw that its condition was deteriorating rapidly owing to the hard conditions that it was being put through and decided that her husband could drive it in order to provide a service.  Four years ago, Tezalia bought her first vehicle and, over the years, she has also refurbished other vehicles as they deteriorate rapidly owing to the daily stresses that they are put through.\r\n\r\nTezalia enjoys her business as it makes her income with which she is able to cover her family's expenses.  She started working in her business because she needed an income and was unable to find a stable job.  She now feels more secure.  She doesn't like it when her motorcycle taxis experience problems very quickly as it creates unforeseen expenses.  However, she is still able to make good profits.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Tezalia is requesting a loan for 1,000 soles.

A pesar de su deseo de ser una profesional, ella s\u00f3lo alcanz\u00f3 a terminar sus estudios de instrucci\u00f3n secundaria.  Se separ\u00f3 de su esposo y fue un obst\u00e1culo muy dif\u00edcil de sobrellevar, no tuvo la oportunidad de tener hijos por lo que ella vive sola. Vive en la Parroquia de Chig\u00fcilpe a 15 minutos del centro de Santo Domingo la ciudad capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, un lugar que  tiene un comercio muy activo ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio entre sierra y costa de Ecuador. Esta parroquia tiene varias viviendas de cemento y mixtas de madera con cemento. Tiene un r\u00edo que es muy visitado y en donde los turistas y habitantes practican varios deportes y adem\u00e1s tienen la oportunidad de conocer una cultura ts\u00e1chila que suele contar sus leyendas a los visitantes en medio de una fogata y camping. Santo Domingo que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada de la regi\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n contribuye con actividades como la agricultura, ganader\u00eda, pesca y manufactura, ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. \nMar\u00eda lidera el Grupo \u201cGrandes Comerciantes\u201d, un grupo de 4 personas que se unieron tras el mismo objetivo; buscar apoyo para mejorar y crecer con el negocio que  emprendieron hace algunos a\u00f1os para mejorar su calidad de vida y la de sus familias.\nMar\u00eda se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras en un peque\u00f1o espacio de su casa. Ella emprendi\u00f3 con esta actividad desde hace 10 a\u00f1os ya que era necesario aportar con los gastos de la casa. Ahora tiene que sustentar sola sus necesidades y todos los gastos del hogar como son servicios b\u00e1sicos, arreglos eventuales, etc.  Esta mujer emprendedora requiere el cr\u00e9dito para comprar mayor variedad de frutas y verduras y as\u00ed incrementar sus ingresos que le ayudar\u00e1n a tener una mejor  calidad de vida. \nSus amigos emprendedores como ella; Karen, Jaime y Carmen se dedican a diferentes actividades.   Karen es una joven de 19 a\u00f1os, es soltera y tiene un hijo que se est\u00e1 educando, ella se dedica a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos de forma ambulante y requiere comprar productos de promoci\u00f3n para obtener mejores precios.

Estas personas se han encontrado con obst\u00e1culos para el crecimiento en sus negocios debido a la falta de capital y oportunidades de cr\u00e9ditos, ahora para lograr este objetivo acudieron a la sucursal que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa tiene en Santo Domingo y en donde les brindaron agilidad y confianza. Los integrantes de este grupo tienen en com\u00fan el trabajo duro y esforzado que realizan cada d\u00eda y que  sin embargo nada ha sido causa para que alguno se d\u00e9 por vencido, pues sus motivaciones personales y familiares les fortalecen para seguir adelante y luchar por sus sue\u00f1os.","en":"Mar\u00eda, 51, has gotten ahead despite various obstacles that have arisen in her life.  Despite her wish of becoming a professional, she was only able to finish secondary school.  She separated from her husband and this was a very difficult obstacle to overcome.  Because she lives alone she never had children.  She lives in Chig\u00fcilpe Parish, 15 minutes from the center of Santo Domingo, capital city of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas Province, a very commercially active place that\u2019s become a land port of exchange between the mountain and coastal regions of Ecuador.\n\nThis parish has several cement dwellings and others that are a blend of wood and cement.  It has a river that\u2019s very popular with tourists and residents partake of various sports while also having the opportunity of learning about the Ts\u00e1chila culture through sharing legends and storytelling around campfires.  Santo Domingo is the third most populous city in the region and also has agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing and manufacturing since it\u2019s become a place for commercial interchange between the country\u2019s mountain and coast regions.\n\nMar\u00eda leads the \u201cGrandes Comerciantes\u201d (Great Merchants) group, a group of four persons who joined together seeking the same goal: to find support to improve and grow in businesses they started some years ago to improve their and their families\u2019 quality of life.\n\nMar\u00eda sells fruit and vegetables in a small space set aside at home.  She started this activity ten years ago because she needed to contribute towards household expenses.  She now must cover her needs and all household expenses like utilities, occasional repairs, etc. by herself.  This enterprising woman needs a loan to buy a larger variety of fruit and vegetables to increase income to help her have a better quality of life.\n\nHer enterprising friends like her, Karen, Jaime and Carmen, carry out a variety of activities.  Karen, 19, is single and has a son attending school.  She sells cosmetics from place to place and needs to buy products that are on special sale to get better prices.  Jaime, like Mar\u00eda, sells fruit and vegetables and wants to buy seasonal fruit to increase sales.  Carmen has two children.  She sells shoes and casual clothes.  She will invest in a wider variety of products.\n\nThese people have faced business growth obstacles due to lack of capital and credit opportunities.  In order to reach their objective now, they called on a branch office Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa has in Santo Domingo where they were met with trust and flexibility.  The members of this group have hard work and effort they do daily in common and none of them have ever given up because the personal and family motivation the group has in common is hard, dedicated work they do every day to reach their dreams.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2539.19,"image":{"id":1316656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Vive con su hermano Mario en Quito la capital de los ecuatorianos, en el barrio llamado \u201cChillogallo\u201d ubicado al sur de la ciudad, sector que hasta hace pocos a\u00f1os no era tomado en cuenta dentro de los sectores econ\u00f3micos fuertes de la capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, ahora este sector es considerado una fuerza de la econom\u00eda de la ciudad. En este lugar se encuentran familias emprendedoras que han luchado para sobresalir. Entre nativos y migrantes de otras ciudades y pa\u00edses, ha sido el punto de encuentro de habitantes de varias provincias, y est\u00e1 reconstruido con extensas calles, un sector en el cual su alta actividad comercial es cada vez m\u00e1s fortalecida y aporta en gran manera al crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de la ciudad. Se destaca en esta zona los parques con amplias zonas verdes en los cuales se dan cita las familias los fines de semana. Hay gran accesibilidad a todo tipo de servicios y sus habitantes son emprendedores que aprovechan cada oportunidad que se presenta con establecimiento de nuevos negocios.\nFredy emprendi\u00f3 con el establecimiento de una tienda de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad en este sector desde hace 3 a\u00f1os; lo aprendi\u00f3 de algunos familiares e invierte al menos 6 horas en la atenci\u00f3n del mismo. Con su esfuerzo este negocio se ha ido fortaleciendo, sin embargo la dificultad de conseguir financiamiento para el crecimiento de su negocio, ha sido un obst\u00e1culo que se ha presentado muy seguido. Fredy requiere un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual pueda comprar productos para llevar a su tienda y ofrecer surtido a sus clientes, adem\u00e1s comprar algunas legumbres y frutas que siempre son solicitadas por quienes llegan a comprar al lugar. Con los ingresos adicionales que obtenga, Fredy podr\u00e1 financiar la continuaci\u00f3n de sus estudios universitarios a distancia para as\u00ed no descuidar su negocio.

","en":"Fredy is a hardworking young man who is 23 years old and single. He does not have children. He has taken several courses at the university and his greatest dream is to finish his studies in order to become a professional and contribute to his country\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nFredy lives with his brother, Mario, in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in a barrio called \u201cChillogallo,\u201d which is located in the southern part of the city. Until recently the neighborhood was ignored as an area of strong economic growth in the capital. Now, however, this area is considered a strong center of economic growth. Here, hardworking families have struggled to succeed. The area\u2019s inhabitants include both native-born and migrants from other cities and countries. It has been a meeting point for people from various provinces and it is being re-built with broad streets. It is an area with a high level of commercial activity and it is constantly growing and contributing to the economic growth of the city. Parks form spacious green zones where families get together on weekends. The people here have access to all kinds of services and they are entrepreneurs who take advantage of every opportunity to establish new businesses.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Fredy opened a store selling basic necessities in the area. He learned the business from some relatives and devotes at least six hours a day to it. Through his efforts, this business has been growing. Nevertheless he has often encountered difficulty in obtaining funding to expand his store. He needs a loan so that he can purchase products to stock his store and sell to his customers. In addition he wants to buy vegetables and fruits, which are in high demand from his customers.  With the additional income he will receive, Fredy will be able to finance his university studies at a distance so that he can also tend to his business while he studies. \r\n\r\nThanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, this enterprising young man will be able to finally accumulate the capital that he has been unable to acquire until now. Thus he can continue to grow personally, as a business man and professionally. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":957.96,"image":{"id":1319670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase products to expand the selection of goods in his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Quito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-03-26T01:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-04-25T01:10:08Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1056,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":102.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":104.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":106.32},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":108.7},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":110.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":112.88},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":114.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.57},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.13},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":98.14,"local_amount":96.41,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":98.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524940,"comment":null},{"amount":100.7,"local_amount":98.92,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133245,"comment":null},{"amount":102.07,"local_amount":100.26,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":102.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313784,"comment":null},{"amount":104.57,"local_amount":102.72,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565389,"comment":null},{"amount":106.13,"local_amount":104.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":106.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814428,"comment":null},{"amount":108.24,"local_amount":106.32,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":108.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320600,"comment":null},{"amount":110.65,"local_amount":108.7,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":110.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856290,"comment":null},{"amount":112.55,"local_amount":110.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":112.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059866,"comment":null},{"amount":114.91,"local_amount":112.88,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":114.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995211,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-03-29T15:10:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":540511,"name":"Loani Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Loani, es un Banco Comunal ubicado en la ciudad de Concepci\u00f3n; lo conforman  17 socios, los cuales tiene distintos rubros en los que aprovecharon su cr\u00e9dito.
