Adem\u00e1s para la temporada de caf\u00e9 Maira se dedica a la venta de ropa ya que para esta temporada de fin de a\u00f1o el movimiento en la zona donde ella habita es bueno para el comercio obteniendo mayores ingresos ya que ella piensa que no solo pueden subsistir del caf\u00e9 y existe la probabilidad de que el precio baje en el mercado, o que el intermediario no le pague el caf\u00e9 a un precio justo.\nMaira solicita financiamiento para la compra de abono, foliares, fertilizantes y pago de mano de obra para sacar el caf\u00e9 y hacer todo el procedimiento, ya que la propiedad cultivada es grande y quiere evitar el descuido de las mismas al momento de la recolecci\u00f3n o del cuidado.\nMaira tiene como meta mejorar la producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 para mejorar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos y as\u00ed comprar m\u00e1s propiedades para dejar en herencia a sus hijos, teniendo el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana donde trabajar y donde poder construir sus hogares.\n","en":"Maira is 36 years old, she has completed primary school but she didn't like to study. Now she is married and they have three children together. She and her husband cultivate coffee together with their oldest child who is 12 years old and has recently finished sixth grade. Their second child is six years old and has just finished her preparatory year, moving on to primary school next year. Their third child is three years old and goes to kindergarden. \r\n\r\nMaira has cultivated coffee since she was a child, because her parents taught her this activity and the required knowledge, which she continues putting into practice together with her husband. They inherited the land they are working from her husband's parents. They own 3 \u00bd plots of land, three are producing and the last half is being planted. \r\n\r\nIn addition to cultivating coffee, Maira sells clothes because during the end of the year the area where she lives is very busy and thus suited for commerce. She takes this opportunity to increase her income, thinking that they can't rely solely on coffee because there is a risk that the market price goes down or that the intermediaries don't pay her a fair price.\r\n\r\nMaira is requesting a loan in order to buy compost, liquid plant food and fertilizers. She will also use it to pay for labor to care for the coffee and harvest it, because her cultivated area is large and she doesn't want it to be neglected during growth or harvest. Maira's goal is to increase her production of coffee in order to improve her income so that she can buy more land. She wants to leave it as an inheritance to her children, making sure they have a place to work and build their homes in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural inputs for her coffee cultivations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maira Lizeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T17:46:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639346,"name":"Victor Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victor es un hombre de 55 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Ca\u00f1ete, en el distrito de Imperial con su esposa y sus 3 hijos, el es muy trabajador, entusiasta, que dedica todos sus esfuerzos por sacar adelante a su familia; lamentablemente por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos y por la necesidad que tuvo de trabajar desde muy joven, Victor no pudo estudiar una carrera profesional.\nPor iniciativa propia, Victor se dedica a sembrar plantas medicinales, las cuales luego vende en los mercados de su ciudad, el trabaja todos los d\u00edas por un aproximado de 10 horas y cree que le va bien por su dedicaci\u00f3n y esfuerzo.\nVictor se encuentra muy agradecido con los prestamistas Kiva, ya que gracias a la ayuda brindada realizara el mejoramiento de su vivienda, ya que desea reforzar el techado y las paredes de su hogar, as\u00ed pues Victor seguir\u00e1 trabajando y esforz\u00e1ndose para lograr su gran sue\u00f1o de tener una vivienda segura y adecuada para su familia.

He is a 33-year-old resident of a village in the Qubadiyon region of Tajikistan.  He would like to start his own business, but lacks the capital to do so; being a successful livestock farmer takes not only a lot of time, but money as well.  For instance, any cattle of good stock cost upwards of $1000 USD.  All the same, Shurat is not seeking to borrow a whole lot of money.  He doesn't like to take risks, and would much rather start small than risk everything at the outset.  He plans on taking out a loan to buy only a couple of cows for starters.  After he determines when they've been fattened enough and are ready to sell, he'll sell the cows at a local market for more than he paid for and make a tidy profit.  He hopes to earn an honest wage by dealing in cattle, and grow his business over time.  First and foremost, he needs to get his business up and running, and hopes you'll help him by contributing to his loan!"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1482460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"set up a new livestock-raising business and buy some bull calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T11:30:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shuhrat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":327.6},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":336.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":346.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":355.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":365.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":376.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":386.6},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":397.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":408.6},{"due_date":"2014-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":431.8},{"due_date":"2014-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":443.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":456.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":469.1},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":482.2},{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":495.7},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":509.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":523.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":538.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":553.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":569.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":585.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":601.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":618.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.34},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.49},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.26},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.83},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.44},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.92},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.78},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.71},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639353,"name":"Maritza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza, de 50 a\u00f1os, es una mujer valiente y trabajadora, est\u00e1 casada con Max y con \u00e9l tiene 6 hijos, 2 de los cuales aun viven junto a ella y su esposo en su casa propia.

They all live in the same community and have known each other for several years. In this community, people still preserve their mother tongue, Mazahua. Most women still wear their very colorful traditional garments. The most celebrated holiday in this community is September 14, \"The Lord of the Miracles\" day. \r\n\r\nAlejandra is a hard-working woman aged 45. She is married to Jos\u00e9 since 25 years back, and they have formed a family with nine children whereof three are still dependent on their parents. Jos\u00e9 works in the field and Alejandra breeds and fattens chickens, turkeys, and sheep and then sells them to neighbors, friends, and relatives. \r\n\r\nShe has been running this business for three years and she says she started it when she was offered her first VisionFund loan, thinking that this activity could help her pay for the household expenses and for her children's education. Alejandra has already completed several loan cycles and thanks to that she has been able to buy her little animals. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the VisionFund loans and to Kiva, my family has received many benefits because now we can pay for my children's studies without any difficulties.\" She comments that the only hardship is when her animals get sick, or even die. This makes Alejandra very sad because it entails losses in investments and income. She says that it is very easy and comfortable to raise animals because she can keep an eye on her children while she is taking care of her animals. Alejandra's dream is to be able to continue raising her animals, thus continuing paying for the costs of her children without difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are Victoria, who sells fruits and vegetables; Julia, who raises sheep; Mar\u00eda del Carmen and Leticia who run grocery stores; Alberto, who will rent centerings for construction; and Bonifacia, who raises turkeys. They are all grateful to VisionFund and to Kiva for the loan they have been offered, because it will help them to grow their businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1477382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy chickens, turkeys, and sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dotegiare, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bonifacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":7000},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T14:33:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640528,"name":"Akiba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Saleh fait partie du groupe  Akiba et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

She considers this business profitable because it consistently brings her good incomes. She comments that she decided to start this business with her family's well-being in mind and in order to help her husband cover for the household expenses. Now she is hoping to establish another stall and increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis time she is requesting 1,000 PEN and she is grateful for the opportunity offered, which allows her to continue working to achieve her goals.

She studied through high school and then met someone and had a baby.  A while afterwards, she separated from him.  She studied a nursing career but never actually worked in this profession due to the fact that it is very difficult to find work; a person needs to know someone in order to actually find a position in a health center or public clinic.  \r\n\r\nLater, she found a person to spend her life with, and together they have twins (her first son lives with his grandmother).  With this new relationship and through their combined efforts, Wendy and her life partner bought a plot of land and constructed a home.  Her eldest son is seven years old and is in second grade.  The twins are four years old and are in preschool.  \r\n\r\nShe makes a living growing coffee; she learned how to grow and harvest coffee from her parents when she was a young girl.  She has one plot of land and all of it is dedicated to producing coffee.  She acquired this farmland through her own efforts, and it is located in the area behind her house.  This allows her to give a lot of personalized attention to her coffee crops.\r\n\r\nWendy's goal is to improve her coffee production.  This would permit her to increase her economic income and to buy more land so that she can leave an inheritance to her children, who already know how to harvest coffee.  She hopes that her children will be able to improve their lives and become excellent professionals in the future.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, she is requesting a loan to buy farming supplies, like manure, liquid fertilizers, regular fertilizers, etc.  These items can help protect and strengthen her coffee crops, allowing her to begin reaching her goals, objectives, and dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies to attend to her coffee crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"comayagua","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wendy Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-30T18:20:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639790,"name":"Rugiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

Larisa reports that this was a big improvement.  She says, \"we work as hard as before, but our income is much bigger!\"  It was difficult for her to raise her son alone.  They never had enough money, but now she is joyful because they now have some security and success, and with her son now grown, she has someone on whom she can rely.\r\n\r\nThe loans really help Larisa.  She was fearful when she took out the first one, but with time she has come to understand that without the loan she wouldn't have been able to get to where she is today.  Larisa is requesting a loan of 25,000 hryvni (UAH).  She wants to build an additional greenhouse to be able to grow more tomatoes.  Since they still have undeveloped land where it will be possible to build two more greenhouses, Larisa looks forward to working together again in the future.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1482532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build one more green house for raising tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Larisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-01T00:37:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639403,"name":"Junior","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"J\u00fanior, de 21 a\u00f1os, es soltero y vive junto a sus padres en su casa propia.

However, this year like many farmers, Natalya and her neighbors suffered from unseasonable frosts.  In the spring, Natalya tried to save her cucumbers, but nonetheless they all froze.  So she replanted and was able to reap a good harvest, but later than she had planned.  This means that her profits were less than planned.  But Natalya didn't give up hope--she is a very up-beat person.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her income next year, Natalya is planning to build an additional greenhouse on her land, for which she is requesting a loan of 30,000 hryvni (UAH).  She also has plans to install heating in her greenhouses next year.

But most of all, she is very hardworking.  She is 43 years old, and has been married for 25 years to Leobardo.  Twenty-five years ago they formed a family with 3 daughters who are no longer their dependents.  Lupita has had a business making caps, scarves, gloves, capes, legwarmers, and other woolen items for 20 years.  She says that she started the business because in her community many people work making these kinds of handicrafts, and it is very common for the people to knit these items and later sell them.  Lupita comments that \"in my family, knowledge of embroidery has been passed down through the generations.\"  \r\n\r\nLupita's husband taught her to stitch.  She makes these products all through the year, but unfortunately her work is not valued, because her pay is very little.  However, she is requesting a loan to buy wool yarn to make her embroidered products, because in this season of every year, she goes to another city to sell her handicrafts.  This is the best way for her to obtain the highest earnings, although it is very risky to travel to these cities.  The difficulty that Lupita is experiencing is that she lacks the money to stock up on merchandise and buy more yarn.  In the place where she sells, her customers ask for special garments, and she needs wool in various colors.  Lupita tells us that she develops her styles and color combinations by observing how people dress, and her work is very unique.  With her aunt, she has plans to open new businesses, including the sale of clothing and a grocery store.  Lupita will tend to the 2 businesses, because she can not go out to work in more distant places because she suffers from a back injury."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy woolen yarn, gloves, scarves, hats, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Jaltepec, San Jose del Rincon","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-30T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-29T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":947.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":971.31},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1021.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1134.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1132.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1207.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1330.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1387.36},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1459.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1539.68},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1613.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.99},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.85},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.13},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.36},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-02T21:56:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":639433,"name":"Los Rodris El Rincon Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rafaela Violeta de estado civil casada.

She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue in the operation of her business.

He's married and his wife works on the farm taking care of their laying hens.  His oldest child works in the capital and his next one, a daughter, works for the city.  The third one lives in the United States and the fourth one is currently a student in his second year of legal studies.\r\n\r\nDimas makes a living raising and selling laying hens.  He also has a small metal shop where he fabricates doors, windows, and the like.  He has sold chickens for 15 years.  His parents always had poultry at home.  Then he decided to go to an agroservice for technical advice about this job.  On their advice he immediately bought 200 hens and because of his knowledge managed to keep them until they stopped laying.  Then he got rid of them and bought another lot.  He liked the work and has continued with it up to the present.\r\n\r\nBefore this job Dimas worked growing basic grains because of a lack of economic resources.  The farm where he keeps his poultry is a kilometer from his house; he can't keep them closer because of hygiene issues.  He gets there by car or bicycle or on foot.  His wife helps him take care of the hens.  He generally works from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nDimas will buy 40 quintals of concentrated feed with the loan.

With profits from her farming, she wishes to invest in her business so that in the future she can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance her farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He started his business in 1999.\r\n\r\nHe works seven days in a week and 13 hours per day and started his business because a friend advised him to carry out such business after he explained to him the good profits one can make out of such a business.
