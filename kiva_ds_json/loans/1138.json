is 32 years old. She lives in a small village in Dusheti District with her two children, who go to school. Rusudan requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nRusudan works as a waitress at local restaurant and she gets a small monthly income. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs in the \"subsistence poor\" category. \r\n\r\nRusudan requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Rusudan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit.

He lives in the small village of Kvareli District with his parents, brother, and grandmother, who is provided with a retirement pension. Shota requested loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. The family has a vineyard and 0.3 hectares of agricultural land, where aubergine (eggplant) is grown. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. The profits are hardly enough to buy food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nShota has requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Shota has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products.

The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Zurab will open a caf\u00e9. He has a space at the local board building. He plans to do a small renovation, purchase all the needed equipment and products, and open a caf\u00e9. As there are a lot of people working in this building and also a lot of locals going there for civil issues, Zurab will have a good number of clients. He will earn a good profit and try to develop his business more. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She purchases clothes from different areas and sells them in the main market at profitable rates. Nighat is a responsible mother of four children. Her husband makes his living as a daily worker whose income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. Her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. To cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to purchase a variety of clothes in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend a part of the profits on the improvement of her house.

He lives in the small village of Mtskheta District with his wife and granddaughter, who goes to the local school. Elguja requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time, because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nElguja works as an builder on private orders and gets income, which is not stable. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the poor subsistence category. \r\n\r\nElguja requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Elguja has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

is 40 years old. She lives in Batumi District with her children: eight-year-old George and 10-year-old Sopho. Lali requested a loan from the local financial institutions several times for the family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of the low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. Lali has a bakery. She bakes pastries and sells them. Her income is really small and it\u2019s hardly enough to feed her children. Lali requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lali has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of a business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Lali will purchase a bed. She has few empty rooms in her house.

She lives in the small village of Khobi District with her wife and two children, who go to school. Irma requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is actively involved in agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of land where they grow mandarin trees, nut trees, and bay trees. They sell the harvested products locally at a good price. In addition, Irma works as a teacher at the local school. It pays hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIrma requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Irma has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irma will purchase a milking cow and will renovate shed for the cow.

Her loan request was rejected every time, because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a milking cow, whose milk is used in making cheese products. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides this, her husband works as an electrician and gets a small income. It is hardly enough food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the poor subsistence category. \r\n\r\nMaka requested loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Maka has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of a business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit, Maka will build a greenhouse. After the greenhouse is built, she will be able to sow vegetables there. The harvested vegetables will be sold at local markets at a good price. This will increase the income of their family.

He lives in the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, with his 22-year-old wife Diana, who is a student. George requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nGeorge is working in a cleaning company on a small monthly salary, which is the only source of the income for the family. It\u2019s rarely enough to cover all the monthly expenses, especially to pay Diana\u2019s studying fees. \r\nGeorge requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. George has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit George will purchase equipment to open a car washing center.

She joined by invitation from a consultant from the institution who visited her at home.  Her current business is selling clothing and she started it with merchandise she bought with loans through Pro Mujer.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting now is to buy clothing at wholesale markets so she can sell it at her stall.  This means of income allows her to generate resources to maintain her household.  She is married and has nine children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes most about Pro Mujer, she says it is the credit, training and health area.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1364023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T10:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T10:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana  Rebeca\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":20707.05,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1657.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1717},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1746.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.77},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":240.18},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":248.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":253.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.9},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568389,"name":"Kebbeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kebbeh is 28 years old and she lives and works in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County, which is located by the sea.

Ana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNowadays the family has no source of income. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nAna requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

is 29 years old. He lives in a small village in the Chokhatauri District with his mother, Rusudan. Manuchar has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up. However, he has not had success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family comes from their agricultural activities. Specifically, they have two milking cows, five calves, a pig and piglets. Rusudan produces cheese products and sells them at the local markets. They have 0.6 hectares of agricultural land, where 500 nut trees are grown. They sell 400 to 500 kg of nuts seasonally and at a good price. It is hardly enough to put food on the table for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nManuchar has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Manuchar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his loan, Manuchar will purchase a tractor. This will enable him to receive orders to transport wood, thereby increasing the income of his family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is married to Jose and they have 5 children who are 21, 19, 17, 5, and 3 years old.  They all live together in their own home.  Felicita works as a carpenter with her husband.  She began doing this work in a small shop in her home.  She began by buying some wood-cutting machinery thanks to money that she was able to save over time.  She acquired customers little by little and her production increased so that her business grew over time.  She has worked in this capacity for 11 years, initially by working alone with the help of her husband, but now she has two employees that help her in all areas of the business.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because she continually generates the income that she needs to pay her household expenses, along with the cost of education for her children and other expenses.

The harvested product is sold at the local market. Her additional income is a monthly pension. \r\n\r\nVenera requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Venera will purchase a small stock of groceries. She has a commercial space in front of her house that will be used for selling the products. She plans in the future to use the profit and add a bakery to her shop. She will bake pastries and sell them to earn more income.

is 50 years old. He lives in Senaki District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, an infant granddaughter and his mother. His mother is provided with a retirement pension. Malkhaz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz has an auto workshop, where he works as an artisan and repairs damaged cars. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMalkhaz requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

At present she has a business of sewing and selling aprons.  She makes known that she started this business with a small amount of resources that she was able to buy with the loans taken out from Pro Mujer.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now is for the increase of capital to buy fabric that she will acquire from the markets wholesale and subsequently make into what she will sell in her sales space.  This form of work allows her to generate resources to maintain her household as much as possible as she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the health services. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6075,"image":{"id":1364070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T14:30:00Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T14:30:00Z","loan_amount":6075,"lender_count":189,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilma\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geronima\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":41919.19,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":6075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5808.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":6018.39},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6018.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6018.39},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6018.39},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6018.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6018.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":841.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":872.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":872.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":872.19},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":872.2},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":872.19},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":872.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1714.01,"local_amount":11827.16,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":11843.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390669392,"comment":null},{"amount":872.2,"local_amount":6018.39,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6026.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399915151,"comment":null},{"amount":872.19,"local_amount":6018.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6026.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197782,"comment":null},{"amount":872.2,"local_amount":6018.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6026.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153529,"comment":null},{"amount":872.19,"local_amount":6018.39,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":6026.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615106,"comment":null},{"amount":872.21,"local_amount":6018.47,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6026.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-02T00:14:33Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:20:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568481,"name":"Adama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 23-year-old Adama from Jui eastern area in Sierra Leone.

Her future plan is to be able to expand the coffee crops because her dream as a mother is to see her children complete their schooling and to offer them better quality of life and that they have more opportunities in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1363417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"masaguara, otoro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T16:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T16:50:01Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xiomara Jaquelene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":13500},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":13500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T15:20:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567743,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosalina es una mujer de 40 a\u00f1os de edad casada y madre de 5 hijos la cual tiene un grado de educaci\u00f3n primaria completo cursado hasta el 6 grado.

At present, Komron works as a taxi driver. He transports passengers across the city. Since he lives in a large city, and many people here use taxis, his business is growing fast.

He lives in the same compound as his five children and helps to care for them.  He lives in the Kiambu district in central Kenya where he operates a small electronics shop in Juja town and also runs an M-Pesa business.  The two businesses enable him to earn approximately $210 US per month which he uses towards his family's expenses.  He recently happened to visit Visionary Empowerment Programme and was introduced to the available solar lamps and their advantages.  He has opted to change his business from electronics to solar lamps, and believes this will double his profits since his customers have been frequently complaining of high electricity bills and occasional power shortages.  \n\nVEP advanced this loan to George so he could purchase ten PowaPack 5w home devices, each of which can be used to light four rooms, power a radio and also charge a mobile phone.  With this solar package, his customers will be able to save on their monthly electricity bills.  Those without electricity can replace their kerosene lamps with cleaner solar lamps which are less costly than installing electricity.  By selling these lamps, he expects to make profits of around $23 per lamp.  Combined with the income from his M-Pesa business, this will put him in a position to repay the loan in 12 months and also reinvest some money into his business for expansion.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.5,"image":{"id":1365292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase solar lamps for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.166667 36.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T17:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T17:10:21Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"George Ngari","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390694378,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399940560,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410681379,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987568,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639943,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867597,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T18:50:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568521,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is 24 years old and single, with one child, one year old.

Through their network at the grassroots level, they can reach many women and create more awareness about the usage of efficient cookstoves.  They will also be able to transform their environment by reducing deforestation. \n\nVEP has advanced them a loan to purchase 20 Firewood Jikos each, totalling to 180 Jikos.  Each Jiko costs about $32 US and will be sold at $39 making a profit of about $8 per Jiko.  With this profit and income from the clothing business, the ladies can be self employed and financially stable.  Their income will be used to repay the loan and some profits will be ploughed back into the business to ensure sustainability.\n\nTheir dream is be the central point of sale for renewable energy in

They live in the Chogoria district in eastern Kenya.  Grace is employed as a housekeeper where she earns approximately $70 US per month.  She also practices dairy farming on her half-acre piece of land, where she makes about $47 US per month from the sale of milk.  This money is only enough to care for her small family and save $23 as investment for the future.  \n\nBeing an ambitious woman, she also wants to make more savings which will secure her children\u2019s future.  Out of her little savings she started a shop in Chogoria town where she sold energy saving cook stoves.  These stoves not only help in preserving the environment, as they emit less smoke, but are also eco-friendly as they use less charcoal when compared with the traditionally used stoves.  The residents of Chogoria spend about $47 per month on charcoal, but with the efficient cook stoves they will be able save at least 50% of that each month.\n\nRealizing that her business is making a profit margin of about $17.50 per stove according to the few stoves she was able to purchase and sell from her savings, she opted to take a loan through VEP to buy 40 Envirofit charcoal stoves.  With the profit margin and the savings from the sale of milk, she will be in a position to repay the loan in twelve months and also make more savings from the business.  This will empower her as well as offer financial security for her and her children.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":712.5,"image":{"id":1365490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase energy saving cook stoves for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chogoria","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-06-05T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-05T17:40:07Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace Wanjiru","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390694380,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399940562,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-19T09:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410681381,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:29:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419987570,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639945,"comment":null},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":10117.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867599,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-05T17:43:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":567749,"name":"Johnny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johnny has successfully started his clean energy enterprise with EarthSpark.

All of her children are in primary school and depend on her for all their needs.  To care for them, she practices farming as her source of income.  She has five dairy cows, three of which she milks to get approximately 30 liters of milk that she sells to a local hotel for 25 US cents per liter.  She also rears pigs which she is able to sell after their maturity period of 6 months at about $470 US per pig, making a profit margin of around $82.  Currently she has 3 piglets to be sold in December.  \n\nIncome from her farming work is shared among her many responsibilities, and the money is often not enough to cover her needs.  To save on some of her expenses, VEP officials advised her to have a biodigester installed to cut down on the cost of fuel.  With a biodigester she would have sufficient fuel for cooking and lighting, hence replacing her kerosene lantern with clean, free energy.  This will allow her to save the money previously spent on charcoal and firewood and use it to finance other needs.\n\nEvery month, Mary spends at least $35 US on kerosene and $17.50 US on charcoal, without accounting for the long hours spent walking to the forest every week to collect firewood.  All of this will be saved by having a biodigester at her homestead.  Additionally, with the organic bioslurry from the biodigester, she can practice organic agriculture through composting and this will also save her from buying fertilizers.  Her crop yield will surely increase and never will she suffer from food insecurity.  In fact, her harvest will increase and enable her to sell some crops to create a new channel of income.\n\nWith this in mind, VEP has financed her this loan to be repaid in 24 months, and confidently believe it will be repaid promptly as her savings increase.\n\n

The business has been in operation for three years. She says the main challenge faced is lack of working capital to buy enough clothing, so as not to continue traveling in order to buy stocks. Keryline has requested a loan of $300 to buy blouses, tracksuits, bags, boots and hair products for resale. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her improve the family's general welfare. In the future Keryline plans to operate a large retail outlet.\t\nThe group consists of five members but the fifth member did not apply to borrow and so only four members applied for a loan.

She also loves fashion. Combine those loves with a deep desire to be her own boss and to determine her own destiny, and what you get is Sweet Peas, a unique boutique for children\u2019s clothing in Fultondale, a Birmingham suburb. \r\n\r\n\u201cI enjoy shopping for little girl's clothing,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cI have a little boy, but when my niece was born, it was like a whole new world with all the cute clothes for the little girls. I enjoy shopping for her. When I decided I wanted to start my own business, I wanted to do something for children.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarissa works for a benefits company, and was able to save money to secure a lease for a commercial space and get initial inventory. She opened Sweet Peas in March 2013, filling the store with hand-made dresses and unique designs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that the clothes I sell are formal, more vintage or old fashioned, like capri pants with ruffles on the bottom, high quality but not formal,\u201d Marissa said. \u201cI have some items for people who like leggings with tunics. We have clothes for infants up to size 20 in girls and boys for the big kids.\u201d\r\n\r\nMarissa didn\u2019t want to get into debt. But she needed a sign and some working capital for advertising, inventory, or whatever else came up as she got her business started. She also wanted to build her business credit to prepare for the possible expansion of her business in the future. She consulted a friend, who told her to look into Accion Texas Inc. Marissa is using her $5,450 loan to buy a store-front sign and inventory. She also plans to hire a web designer to help her build a website.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, Marissa continues to work her full-time job and entrusts the store to her aunt, who handles sales until Marissa can get to the store in the evening and on the weekends. Marissa dreams of expanding and opening several stores in Alabama and possibly outside of the state.

St. Paul is home to the oldest market in Liberia and is known for their fish because of its location by the sea.  St. Paul is a suburb located just outside Monrovia, past the free-port.  It is one of the poorer areas, and you will often find its residents living in sub-standard housing. \n\nNohn has had a table business for the past ten years, selling soft drinks.  She started her business by selling for her mother.  She works ten hours at her business, and her greatest challenge in business is the small income. \n\nNohn intends to use the loan to buy inventory.   She likes her business because she makes more profit.  \n\nShe hopes to one day own a house.

is 32 years old, hardworking and diligent. She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan along her husband, a daughter and a son. Her husband is a government employee but his income is insufficient to pay all of his household expenses. Both of her children are studying in government schools. Aliya is a beautician by profession and has been operating her own beauty salon since 2010. Currently her stock of supplies is very low, which is why she is requesting a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to buy more beauty products like facial creams, lipstick, scrubs, makeup kits, hair colors and other products. She would also like to buy new chairs for her salon. She will use the profits she earns to repay this loan and pay her children's school fees. Her dream is to live a happy, healthy and peaceful life with her family. She is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their support.

All of them are very hard-working people.  Hilaria is part of the Sorpresa group.  She is 44 years old, and she has been married to Juan for 26 years.  Together they make up a family with six children, two of whom are still dependent upon them.\n\nHilaria is a very hard-working person.  She says that she has been raising, fattening, and selling sheep for 27 years.  She says that she started this business activity because when she was little her parents taught her how to care for these little animals.  When she got married to Juan she had to start her own business in order to be able to help with the household expenses and her children\u2019s education because often Juan\u2019s work did not cover the household expenses.  Somehow, Hilaria had to help him.  She says, \u201cThe truth is that I really liked helping my husband in this way because it allowed me to be with my children and not neglect them\u201d.  \n\nThis time she is requesting the loan to buy more lambs and fodder, which will serve to feed her animals.  For years her profits were very good, but she is now facing competition that she has in her own community.  Most of her neighbors raise lambs.  Therefore, it is more complicated when it is time to sell.  People don\u2019t want to pay the price they have normally been paying for lambs.

She hopes that this way she will succeed in giving her family financial security and a full life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.42,"image":{"id":1364957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy a variety of clothing such as skirts, pants, blouses, T-shirts, outfits, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guadalupe Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.41},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":47.41},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.41},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.62},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.68},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.41},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.41,"local_amount":29.41,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":29.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390740521,"comment":null},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":34.22,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399736111,"comment":null},{"amount":35.62,"local_amount":35.62,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411737187,"comment":null},{"amount":37.71,"local_amount":37.71,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":37.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419769506,"comment":null},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":38.57,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430001938,"comment":null},{"amount":40.89,"local_amount":40.89,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":40.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441329644,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-06T00:59:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568946,"name":"Kos Wende Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme S.MARIE  est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe KOS WENDE.

","en":"Bakhtiyor is a resident of the city of Qurgan-Tube.  He is 51 years old, married, and the father of two adult children, a daughter and a son, who now live independently.

Her past two loans have kept up a good pace for her business progressively and she has fully repaid her past loan with success as well. With this new loan, she will spend her portion to buy four sacks of potash to support her farmland. She hopes that this purchase will boost her crop productivity on time and return a good income so that she can buy more pigs to raise for additional income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1365875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy four sacks of potash to support her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Sampov Meas district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T05:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T05:50:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phors","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soeurng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-06T19:55:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568683,"name":"Jean Claude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Claude is 32 years old.

He has always sought to provide his family with the best life he can.  He currently lives with his wife who earns a living making cakes.  Francisco makes a living every year by growing basic grains such as beans and corn.  When the harvest is ready he stores his products in big bags - as shown in the photograph - so that he can later go out to sell them in the local markets.  Francisco wants to increase his sales and so is applying for a loan to buy seeds, manure, fertiliser, pesticides and more.  Francisco wants to be able to count on this loan as he has no other income. With the loan he will be able to continue taking home money to support the household."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":47.92,"image":{"id":1364981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy seeds, manure, fertiliser, pesticides and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T10:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T10:10:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.47,"local_amount":24.47,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":24.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399736534,"comment":null},{"amount":23.45,"local_amount":23.45,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":23.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411737772,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-18T21:54:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568121,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Mercedes, tiene como 12 a\u00f1os de trabajar como peque\u00f1a comerciante, negocio que comenz\u00f3 con el apoyo de su \u00fanico hijo que tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el Reparto Schick una zona con pobladores de escasos recursos y hay mucha delincuencia, ella es madre soltera gracias a su padre quien le regalo un peque\u00f1o terreno pudo hacer con mucho esfuerzo su humilde hogar.

She is 38 years old. She has two wonderful children: one girl and one boy. Muhabbat loves her children very much and always tries to spend time with them, even though she works and does not have much time. Muhabbat was born and grew up in Spitamen Region, in the family of white-collar workers. After finishing secondary school, Muhabbat has enrolled in a Teacher\u2019s College. After finishing college, she used to work as a grammar school teacjer. She really enjoyed her profession. But thingshas turned out in such a way that her salary alone was not enough to support her family. Because of this, in 2003 she started working as a vendor at the regional clothing market. Muhabbat sells men\u2019s clothing as there is good demand for it. Muhabbat has an optimistic attitude, does not let minor issues get her down, and always encourages others, spreading positive energy. During the summer season, Muhabbat would like to expand her selection, and she needs funds. This is why she applied to Arvand for a loan. Muhabbat would like to use her loan to stock up on men\u2019s clothing.\r\nMuhabbat thanks Arvand in advance for its important support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":227.09,"image":{"id":1365831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy men's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-06T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-06T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":137.83},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":142.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":147.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":152.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":157.49},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":168.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":179.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":186.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":192.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":198.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.29,"local_amount":137.83,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":139.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752042,"comment":null},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":142.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-20T09:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":144.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616132,"comment":null},{"amount":31.31,"local_amount":147.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":148.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860000,"comment":null},{"amount":32.37,"local_amount":152.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":153.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136744,"comment":null},{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":157.49,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":159.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900940,"comment":null},{"amount":34.61,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550121,"comment":null},{"amount":35.77,"local_amount":168.35,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":170.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774345,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-21T19:52:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":568750,"name":"Sau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sau is 39 years old.
