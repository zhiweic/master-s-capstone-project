He has been working as a coffee producer for more than 30 years. The community where he lives does not have basic services; water has to be brought up from a well and there is not potable water. Despite all difficulties Florentino has remained optimistic because he is an expert coffee grower and has obtained very good results from previous loans. Florentino's current project is to build a coffee tree nursery, which will provide him with the trees to plant on his farms as well as allow him to sell trees to other growers in his region. He is also beginning the transition from conventional growing methods to organic farming. Without a loan he would not be able to reach his proposed goals. Last year's harvest brought in 15 tons of coffee and within three years he plans to produce 20 tons.

I am the only one who has completed my high school education in my family. I run my own business of sending and receiving money. I am very grateful for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nI live in Mazabuka, a town where sugar is produced. There is also fishing as it is very close to the Kafue River. Running my own business is a very good way for me to earn an honest living. Through my business, I get to meet a lot of people in my town. I also get to make some profits, which helps me to support my siblings and my mother back home in Mansa.\r\n\r\nI am taking out a loan so that I can increase my working capital. Right now I have a working capital of about $620. This is not enough because Mazabuka is a town that is growing and people have come to know about my business but I cannot serve them all. I have many incidents where a customer comes and they need to send $650 to a relative, I have no choice but to ask them to use another shop because I do not have enough cash and electronic at my shop. \r\n\r\nMy hopes and dreams are to expand my business. I am very hopeful that the Kiva loan will give my business the boost that it needs. For my personal life, I hope and wish to be a successful businessman and open up more shops in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3657.95,"image":{"id":1166855,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2700,"youtubeId":"l-fhDXMXsYo","title":null,"thumbnailImageId":1166855},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To add on to his $620 working capital so that he can serve customers sending and receiving larger amounts of money.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Mazabuka","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-08-17T14:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-16T14:10:01Z","loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":33.01,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMK","disbursal_amount":24300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":24300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.5,"local_amount":813250,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":814178.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533422,"comment":null},{"amount":175.4,"local_amount":856750,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":857728.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132522,"comment":null},{"amount":141.47,"local_amount":691000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-26T09:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":691789.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281417,"comment":null},{"amount":141.47,"local_amount":691000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-22T10:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":691789.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339657056,"comment":null},{"amount":184.83,"local_amount":903000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T17:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":904031.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.04,"payment_id":347220335,"comment":null},{"amount":251.41,"local_amount":1228000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T21:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1229402.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355983437,"comment":null},{"amount":270.66,"local_amount":1322000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T13:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1323509.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364677500,"comment":null},{"amount":273,"local_amount":1341000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T13:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1342531.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.55,"payment_id":373062091,"comment":null},{"amount":255.9,"local_amount":1273410,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1274864.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.81,"payment_id":381854142,"comment":null},{"amount":272.8,"local_amount":1340140,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1341670.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.57,"payment_id":390712275,"comment":null},{"amount":298.41,"local_amount":1457560,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1459224.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399957698,"comment":null},{"amount":331.9,"local_amount":1621160,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T21:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1623011.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410241826,"comment":null},{"amount":466.65,"local_amount":2352750,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T01:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2355436.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":15.03,"payment_id":429659116,"comment":null},{"amount":427.55,"local_amount":2137230,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T16:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2139670.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":10.01,"payment_id":439893436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-28T17:27:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":460669,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is applying for a second Kiva loan through Yehu Microfinance.

He is forty-eight years old, married and has four children, all grownups. Albert is considered one of the pioneers in his city in the business of second-hand items. Over twenty years ago, with the collapse of the communist regime, this business was not even known in Albania, yet many talented Egyptians, with Albert being one of them, left the country illegally in search of a business model. Very soon, they found their ways of bringing to their country used items that were so much in need then and even nowadays.\r\n\r\nAlbert never needed a loan until recently when he planned on expanding his business and of course earning more profit through buying\/selling textile raw material and fabrics and also household appliances this time. \r\n\r\nAlbert thanks VisionFund Albania\u2019s staff for the good work they have been doing at reaching out and helping the vulnerable community, and also Kiva for giving them the opportunity to raise money through its lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":983.12,"image":{"id":1167525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

The loan will help him much to earn more secure income through his animal sales.

She sells clothes, an occupation she learned from her mother when she was a little girl.  She rises at 4am to prepare her children\u2019s breakfast and get them ready for school.  Then, at 6am she heads out to visit the various places around her neighborhood since she does it on foot.  To buy merchandise, Fidelicia travels to the nation\u2019s capital because she believes she gets better prices there.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019s requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more merchandise to stock her business and meet customer demand because she\u2019s going to more places and the number of her customers has increased.  She hopes to increase her income to continue sending her children to school and one day send them to high school and give them everything they need.  She wants to acquire a mode of transportation because she feels that at her age selling from place to place on foot is difficult.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1163998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Because of these majestic lines the town welcomes a large influx of tourists every year.\r\n\r\nMaria is mother to a one-year old whom she loves very much. He is her raisin d'\u00eatre and the greatest gift God has given her. In her free time Maria likes to watch television, but most of all she likes to spend time with her son. Now and again she likes to eat one of favorite dishes, the delicious 'lomo saltado' (stir-fried beef with fried potatoes). Because she is from a poor family, Maria only has a high school education, but she would have liked to go to university.\r\n\r\nEvery day Maria goes to work selling beauty products such as perfume, lotions, and make up. She works about seven hours a day, and might have up to ten customers in that time. She believes that the business is doing well because she is friendly to her customers, but most of all because she is keen to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMaria is very grateful to Kiva donors--thanks to their great help she will be able to buy more merchandise such as perfume, make up, lotions, shampoo, and conditioner.

She has five well-bred cows, from which she gets milk every day to sell to a processing business. \"It's one of the biggest in Peru. Thanks to my cows' production, I have daily income,\" she says. They produce an average of 36 liters of milk per day; it's not a fixed amount, as everything depends on the feed she gives them. She wishes to obtain more good quality cows to be able to produce more milk and thus earn more money.\r\n\r\nFelicita belongs to the communal bank \"Productores Huallhua,\" and this is her second loan with MFP. In this time, she has taken advantage of the money she received to improve her business. She promises to be punctual with her loan payments, and she likes working with her group because they all help each other.\r\n\r\nFelicita will invest the money from this loan in the purchase of another milk cow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1164196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy another milk cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-17T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-16T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373528976,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-17T23:39:24Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:18:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":459344,"name":"Elva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elva tiene 26 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada con Percy, con quien tiene dos hijos, a los que educa con mucho amor.

preschool age.  In search of a source of income for the family, she started her own business in selling food products at a small store in 2009.  Thanks to persistence and hard work, Nurgul was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of 20,000 som (KGS).  Successful business development prompted the family to explore new ideas, and the second room in the store was remodeled to become a barbershop and a small business for Nurgul's husband.  In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 75,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her merchandise selection by buying an inventory of tea, butter and sugar, which will be bought by local residents in large quantities to make jams and preserves for the winter period.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into an expansion of her retail space and repairing her house in the summer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1385.06,"image":{"id":1168058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He saw firsthand how garbage removal companies buried in its depths \u201ctreasures\u201d\/recyclable products that were worth saving.  Through his experience, Stephen came up with the idea for his new business.  Dumping treasures' mission is to donate and\/or recycle whatever is possible from garbage. The goal is to minimize their carting load to keep overhead costs at a minimum while still donating and recycling items that people consider trash that for other's may be treasures. The planned operations will be to purchase multiple dumpsters of various sizes. The dumpsters will be homeowner friendly by having the ability to be placed in areas usually not accessible by trucks. The company also plans to service roofers and concrete workers.   Please help us help this creative business get off the ground!

Since it was built, there has not been any complete renovation to it. In winter, his house has too much heat-loss through its roof.  He uses the coal-fired stove to warm the rooms but this creates harmful smoke in the air all around the city. As we are aware, air pollution is one of the critical and biggest issues in Mongolia and all over the world.  Therefore, he has decided to decrease his usage of the coal and repair his house roof.

The area has no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity.  She works as a teller in the bank. One of her sons will move out from his parents' house soon and his family has been building a small winter house for him as a wedding gift. Work on the house is nearly 50 percent done, and the family plans to complete it next spring. \r\n\r\nDue to money shortages, however, the family is missing some building materials needed to complete the house. Mrs. Tuya and her husband are planning to build the house walls with insulation, in order to guard against the freezing cold by losing heat through the walls. It is very important to cut fuel usage such as coal in the winter. Although Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world.  This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C (-40F) even in the cities.  Also in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snowstorms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  In addition to this, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolians' hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers green loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that run on natural gas.  The loan Mrs. Tuya is taking will be used to buy wall insulation materials for building her son's new family house.

There, he offers the public food and soft drinks among other things from his selection of familiar items.  He started this business 18 years ago from a space in his home which is located very close to an intersection where a school is located and buses pass.  This location strengthens sales specifically that of soft drinks, food, and confectionery among others. \r\n\r\nHe works from 6am to 10pm because he is a very hard worker that wants to accomplish his goals of entrepreneurial stability and the well being of his family.  Adolfo's business has strong growth potential and he requires a permanent product offering thus requiring the adaptation of his location with the goal of offering the most comfortable products to his customers. \r\n \r\nHis greatest challenge, however, is not having enough working capital to invest in higher volumes and realizing the improvement of his locale.

She learned the trade from her mother who worked in the Ramada market for more than 20 years and taught her how to do it. Rosario has her own stall and sells breakfasts all day long. She offers tea, coffee, api [a non-alcoholic corn drink] and empanadas. As fate would have it, Rosario is a single mother of four children, but she is brave and works hard to get her children ahead. Three of them are studying in school and one is not yet old enough. She asks for a loan to buy dishes and ingredients like sugar and coffee to make her breakfasts. Her goal is to have a vehicle to move her merchandise and she hopes to see her children become professionals and upstanding people.

is 48 years old and lives in Tskaltubo district. She has two children: 24-year-old Teona and 21-year-old Revaz. They help Marina to run the family agricultural business. In particular, the family has a greenhouse where during the winter season the family grows greens, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Marina sells her production at the local open market. They sell greens locally and then this production is sent abroad as an export. The family works hard but they still don\u2019t have enough income to expand their business.

has a business where he sells goat meat.

Abdalla's business goal is to continue expanding his business. His client base is increasing but he does not have enough capital to respond to the demand. Therefore, Abdalla has come to Yehu Microfinance for his third loan. \r\n\r\nAbdalla is requesting a loan to food supplies in large quantities for the Ramadan celebration -- the Muslim holy month of fasting. Abdalla thinks this investment will be successful because he will have products to offer to his growing number of customers. In the future, he plans to expand his business and hopes to concentrate on strengthening his production to finally fulfill a dream that he shares with his wife: to see their five children grow up in conditions which foster their professional
