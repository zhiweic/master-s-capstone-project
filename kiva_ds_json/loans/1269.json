positive and responsible woman.  She is married and has three children.  She lives with her family in a small village, but the house where they live is small and not completely suitable for a good living in it.  She is a very hardworking and caring mother.   Barohat works as an orderly at a local labor and delivery hospital.  Besides the primary job, she also works part-time as a salesperson at a market.  Barohat's husband is ill and unable to work, and this is why she has to work a lot in order to have an income in the family.  However, what she earns is only enough for living expenses.  With the help of her children, Barohat very recently built a new small house, but now she has to complete the roof for it.  She needs money for this.  This is why Barohat came to Arvand and wants to obtain this loan to purchase construction materials for building the roof.

Mukhavat has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Mukhavat is involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started 15 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mukhavat's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and also a 0.30 hectare land plot, where she grows beans, potatoes and perennial herbs.

Now he has a shop where he works from Monday to Saturday from 9 in the morning until 9 at night. His main customers are people in the district around his shop and the surrounding area. His challenge is to become much more well-known and in future to open another service centre in order to make more income.\r\n\r\nCurrently Yesid needs to buy a larger quantity of accessories and spares for mobile phones and so he has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan. This will be his first loan with this organisation. With his Kiva loan, he will be able to increase the range in his shop and drive his sales, with appropriate stock for the high demand of the year-end. During this season he will be able to attract a lot of customers, making his Kiva loan into a successful investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":43.7,"image":{"id":1472031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a larger quantity of accessories and spares for mobile phones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesid Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83435},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":76488},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":78783},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81146},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83581},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86088},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88671},{"due_date":"2014-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91331},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94071},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96893},{"due_date":"2014-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99800},{"due_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89713}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.78},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.7,"local_amount":83435,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84457.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732258,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T17:51:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634924,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 44 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

","en":"Toshguloy is an elderly 66 year old woman who lives in the J. Rumy region with her husband, son and daughter-in-law.  Despite her age Toshguloy works.  She works at the market and sells vegetables.  Her daughter-in-law recently learned to be a seamstress from a local seamstress.  However, she does not have her own sewing machine in order to take orders for women's dresses.  Toshguloy would like to help her daughter-in-law to open a sewing business and is asking for a loan.  She will use the loan amount to purchase a modern sewing machine.  Toshguloy's daughter-in-law will sew one dress per day.

Kadyrbai has a secondary education. Animal husbandry is the family's main source of income. Kadyrbai started this business 18 years ago by buying cattle with 5,000 KGS. Thanks to Kadyrbai's hard work his farm boasts one dairy cow, a calf, three goats, and a plot of land measuring 2.53 hectares where he grows barley and corn. He earns a monthly income of 15,000 KGS.

They have a family of nine children together, three of whom are still minors and go to school. On this occasion, she is requesting a loan to buy cloth, needles, thread and lace. Felipa has worked making traditional clothing for six years. She says \"when I got married, I taught myself how to sew and cut traditional clothing\". She only makes the clothes to order, for the ladies in the community who still wear these traditional clothes, and she also travels to other communities to offer her wares. Felipa only has a manual machine. Once a month, she travels to Mexico city to buy cloth, thread, lace, and other items. \r\n\r\nThe traditional clothes worn by the Mazahua group are a dress, bib, nahuas, and skirt with a necklace and earrings. Felipa's goal is to continue supporting her children in their studies so that they finish high school and university.

It is a community which celebrates huge festivals such as 2 February, when the town's patron saint, the Virgin of the Candelaria, is celebrated. The group is made up of five women and two men, who chose the name of the group themselves, because they had previously belonged to another group named Granada, but when it separated they had to start again, which is why they named themselves \u201cRenovaci\u00f3n\u201d, meaning renovation in Spanish. \r\n\r\nCarmen is the group's representative. She is 47 and is married to Zenaido. They have been together for 26 years and have a family together with five children, two of whom already have their own children who study. Carmen has made a living raising and fattening pigs for 24 years, almost the same amount of time that she's been married to Zenaido. She decided to start this business because she wanted to help out with household expenses. While Zenaido worked, Carmen raised and fattened pigs, which made it easier for them to pay the household expenses. These increased when their children decided to study, which is why she continues to work in this. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, she is requesting a loan from Vision Fund and Kiva to buy feed for her pigs. Carmen explains that \"I fatten them for four months, and then sell them. We can't keep them any longer because they eat a lot and the feed is very expensive\". A while ago, Carmen's pigs used to get ill and die, which was a problem for her because they represented a loss of earnings and investments for the for the family. However, the situation has now been resolved, because Zenaido learned how to vaccinate them, deworm them, etc. to avoid such large losses.\r\n\r\nCarmen's only goal is to continue supporting her children's studies. One is them is about to finish his degree to become a successful vet. She says \u201cI'd hate for my son to have to abandon his degree halfway through because of a lack of money\". Like Carmen, the group is very grateful to and happy with Kiva and Vision Fund for the loan granted, because it will give them the opportunity to invest in their businesses. Gregoria, Sergio and Clara will invest in their pigs, Albina in her chickens, Rafaela in costume jewellery and \u00c1ngelin sheep."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1462.5,"image":{"id":1460790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy food for their pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T22:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T22:20:16Z","loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rafaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.62},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":365.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429644494,"comment":null},{"amount":731.25,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9520.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439877955,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-21T23:27:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":629093,"name":"Sophie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After working in a variety of industries, UK-native Sophie moved to NYC with the hopes of following her dream of having her own TV commercial production company.\n\nWith 10 years in operation, Sophie's NYC-based TV commercial production company has proven to be a great success.

She and her husband are the only ones involved in the development of this activity.\r\nShe dreams of being the largest producer of this crop in the area while retaining 100% ownership. She wants to be attractive to customers as well as to open up a road to help her have easier access to her land by crossing the rough terrain. Today she has applied for funding to invest in the purchase of fertilizers, manure, insecticides, and other products to prepare her crop for the next harvest in an improved and safer way.

She shares that her alternative would be to take time off from school to work and save money until she could return. Carolina shares that it is important to her to graduate on time so she can enter into the job market as soon as possible. With this loan, Carolina plans to buy her school books. Up until now, she has been managing to get by without them but it has become a challenge. With books and school supplies, she feels she will be able to get better grades. In addition to her responsibilities at school, Carolina currently works 20 hours a week and earns $2 a day as a nanny. With a degree in laboratory sciences, she expects to earn $17 a day.

Aipara, needing an income, started a small business making traditional clothes with an investment of 20,000 KGS. Business is very good, and most importantly Aipara takes pleasure in her sewing work. This gives her a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. Also, Aipara works in animal husbandry and farming. Her farm has one dairy cow, a calf, five sheep, and a small plot of land where she grows potatoes, tomatoes and corn. In order to expand her animal husbandry business, Aipara approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy sheep for breeding.

In order to meet with the increasing demands of her customers, she is interested in buying more variety of cosmetics products for the parlor.

Through her business, Sharon offers assistance in website content, policy and procedure manual writings, proofreading, and content for email campaigns. \u201cI felt the need to provide authors and small businesses with a voice.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor authors, Sharon offers mentorship for content and book cover creations, help finding editors, and sometimes she works as an editor. As a writer, Sharon understands the struggle new authors face. To help them, she provides marketing and distribution tips. And, for the most part, Sharon works alone.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have employees, but I have associates that help with authors. I have editors and graphic artists to network and guide them,\u201d she says. These contracted workers are hired depending on the needs of the author. In a sense, Sharon is a broker between writers, small businesses and nonprofit organizations and artists, editors, publishing companies and anyone else affiliated with the writing industry.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing since I was 8 years old,\u201d she says. However, her dream was quickly shoved aside as her elders drilled in her head that \u201cI needed a good-paying government job,\u201d she recalls. Taking her family\u2019s advice, Sharon enlisted in one of the last sets of the Women\u2019s Army Corps before the government incorporated co-ed troops. Because she is a veteran, Sharon is often invited to business seminars and workshops. It was during one of these events she learned about Accion Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\nSharon says, \u201cOne of the things I want to say about Accion is they are a compassionate lender. I was able to go and share my vision. I didn\u2019t meet a banker hiding behind a desk. I met a person passionate about enabling my vision.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer loan to obtain virtual assistance certification allows her to be an author\u2019s assistant. In this role, she can research, help with public access or written permission, obtain cover work, and eliminate confusion.\r\n\r\nSharon plans to hire an employee before May 2014.

Since he is building a reputation for himself, Octavio decided to create a showroom to help ease customers when choosing what to purchase. \u201cThey wanted to see the product before I bought it. I created a showroom to showcase the quality of products I use,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are then more secure about what they\u2019re buying.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, Octavio employs one designer, but is looking to hire a delivery person in the future. \u201cWhen you buy stuff from me, I give you installation and delivery free,\u201d he says. \r\n\r\nBefore Accion Texas Inc., Octavio went to Compass Bank for a loan, but since his credentials are new in the U.S., he couldn\u2019t receive a traditional loan.  But the bank told him about Accion Texas Inc.  \u201cI went and applied, and they treated me really well,\u201d he says. \u201cThey called me a week later and said I was approved. I am happy because Accion is helping me to build my business and helping me to build my credit.\u201d\r\n\r\nOctavio expects to gain publicity by hiring a graphic designer to create a business logo. Octavio projects he\u2019ll have more sales with the new inventory he purchased with the loan.  And he can now afford to hire a driver and accountant. This will ease his schedule as he visits clients and manages the store after working outside all day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI expect to grow with this loan and probably get another loan,\u201d he says.  Currently, Octavio is working on his website. When completed, you will be able to find the site here: www.arqoctaviocanales.com\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1472155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase more inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Brownsville, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2013-11-21T23:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-20T23:20:22Z","loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Octavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4360,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.87},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":123.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":130.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":132.77},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":134.77},{"due_date":"2014-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":136.79},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":140.92},{"due_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":143.04},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151.81},{"due_date":"2015-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":156.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":163.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":168.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":171.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":173.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":176.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":178.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.41},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.28},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.41},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.32},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.23},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.26},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.32},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.41},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.09},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.62},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.94},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.68},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.18},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-31T21:07:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":634698,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose opened Familia Deli Grocery as a family-run bodega to serve his Perth Amboy, New Jersey community.

He goes to school in the community. Her civil status is in a civil union. She completed school through the second level of secondary school. Her companion has a permanent job and his income helps with household expenses. On the weekends, he helps Claudia Yonari with the various chores in the field. For three years, she has made a living by cultivating coffee. Her parents, farmers, gave her the land she currently cultivates as an inheritance. The land is 15 minutes away by public transportation (moto taxi). She goes there to improve and maintain her crops. One of the challenges she faces is the rising price of supplies that she uses to help her crops as well as the cost of transporting them. This is a difficult cost to minimize because competition is not a problem.<br \/><br \/>Today she is requesting a loan to buy agricultural products such as fertilizer, manure, coffee-growing formula, urea, insecticide, and other supplies.

She produces organic cheeses, which have a high nutrition content that includes calcium, protein, and phosphorus.

The first step that she took was not to keep the cows locked up or enclosed far away from the pastures where they like to graze.  In addition, she does not cut off the horns since the calves were born that way.

It is approximately a two-hour trip from the city of La Paz.  Her loan will be used to buy a pair of dairy cows of improved breed so that she can obtain milk of the best quality.  This will be used as the main ingredient in the production of organic cheese, which is how she currently makes her living.   <br \/><br \/>Julia Clara\u2019s dream is to grow and eventually have an organic farm of her own that is self-sustaining and operates with the use of bio-digesters and biogas.

As the days went by, residents of the area got to know the business and her sales increased. Her range of products grew notably and now after 24 years in business she offers paper goods, hair products, personal hygiene products, beauty items, and more. This has allowed her to have daily income to pay for household necessities, especially now that she is a widow after her husband's death, and all of the financial responsibility is in her hands. Right now, her sales have gone down and she has had to go out and sell products as a street vendor to her friends, relatives and area residents. She hopes that for the end of the December season her sales will increase. That is why she is asking for a loan to buy merchandise wholesale (paper goods, gift bags, Christmas decorations, accessories and more). This way she can fill the demand for products and improve her income level.

She produces organic cheeses, which have a high nutrition content that includes calcium, protein, and phosphorus. At the same time, they lack the nutritional problems usually associated with cheese such as high levels of saturated fats, triglycerides, and saturated fatty acids. The first step that she took was not to keep the cows locked up or enclosed far away from the pastures where they like to graze. In addition, she does not cut off the horns since the calves were born that way. The food she gives them is fresh and of high quality. <br \/><br \/>Isidora lives in her home in the community of Achica Baja, which is in the Viacha sector of Ingavi Province in the Department of La Paz. It is approximately a two-hour trip from the city of La Paz. Her loan will be used to buy a pair of dairy cows of improved breed so that she can obtain milk of the best quality for producing large quantities of organic cheese. <br \/><br \/>Isodora\u2019s dream is to grow and eventually have an organic farm of her own that is self-sustaining and operates with the use of bio-digesters and biogas. This equipment requires that her cows produce at least 12 kilos of manure per day, which is mixed with 60 liters of water. The mixture provides enough methane to last for four hours each day, which prevents the emission of carbon dioxide into the environment. <br \/><br \/>This is the third time Isidora has requested a loan from IMPRO, but the second time through Kiva."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.89,"image":{"id":1131876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a pair of dairy cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Achica Baja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":48,"posted_date":"2013-11-22T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-21T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":554.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":589.43},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":593.07},{"due_date":"2014-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":602.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":628.3},{"due_date":"2014-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":623.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":638.02},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":644.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":658.53},{"due_date":"2014-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":665.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":676.63},{"due_date":"2014-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":690.55},{"due_date":"2014-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":699.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":712.78},{"due_date":"2015-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":722.57},{"due_date":"2015-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":734.52},{"due_date":"2015-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":749.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":816.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.93},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.49},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.88},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.05},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.68},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.95},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.26},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80.93,"local_amount":554.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":559.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429525405,"comment":null},{"amount":85.96,"local_amount":589.43,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":593.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440008213,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T15:58:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":633236,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Guapa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 KU\u00d1A GUAPA est\u00e1 en el 1er. ciclo 16 integrantes, al adquirir el cr\u00e9dito se les facilita herramientas fundamentales para el progreso de sus emprendimientos, ya que cada una tiene esperanzas de poder mejorar sus vidas y ayudar a sus familias.\nUna de las integrantes la se\u00f1ora Maria, se dedica a la venta de comidas, el cr\u00e9dito que pide lo quiere invertir en la compra de los ingredientes para preparar las comidas que vende en un local que tiene para poder seguir mejorando y ganar prestigio y brindar satisfacci\u00f3n a sus clientes.\nLas integrantes formaron un grupo bastante unido, con  la  plena convicci\u00f3n de trabajar todas juntas, apoy\u00e1ndose mutuamente.\n","en":"The committee named \u201cKu\u00f1a Guapa\u201d is in its first loan cycle with 16 members.

client. She has already borrowed 9 times. Mavlyuda is an honest and decent woman. She is a widow and has 2 children. Her son is 20 years old, and her daughter is 23. For more than 9 years, she has worked in the emergency room of a local hospital. She works as a dispatcher.  Ten years ago, Mavlyuda lost her husband. Since then, she has had to work alone to provide for her children. She worked in the field during the day, and at night worked as a nurse at the hospital. This way, she raised her children.

She has a high school education. Her main income comes from raising cattle which she started doing 37 years ago by buying cattle for 1,000 KGS. \r\n\r\nThrough hard work she now has two dairy cows and a 1.71-hectare plot of land where she grows clover and wheat.

The first loan Abdusattor received was to develop his own business. He started a business breeding livestock. His wife does not work. She is a homemaker and looks after their children. In order to have a good income which will be enough to satisfy all of his family's needs, Abdusattor works at his business. He raises and sells cattle. He also sells the milk which he gets from these cattle. Now he wants to expand his business, increase the size of his herd and then receive a bigger profit so that his family can have enough financial resources to cover all of their family expenses. He hopes that this business will help him improve the economic situation of his family. This is why Abdusattor turned to Arvand and hopes to receive a loan to buy more cattle. He thanks Arvand in advance for the financial support.

She is married and is mother to three children. Two of her children are studying at primary school in different school years, and the youngest child is at home. Elida completed her secondary education by graduating with a bachelor degree in social work, thanks to the emotional and financial support of her parents.<br \/>She has a business selling coffee grapes, roasted coffee, homemade bread,  banana and nacatamales [maize, meat and rice in banana leaves]. She does this job because she enjoyed the business from an early age, as she learnt it from her parents.<br \/>Part of the land that she and her husband cultivate is their own, thanks to an inheritance from her parents, and the rest they bought. Their land is located 2 km away from their home, and they reach it on foot together.
