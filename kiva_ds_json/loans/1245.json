Olimpia lives with her husband in their adobe house.  Olimpia has lived all of her life in the countryside.

She bought the land with the savings that she then had.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest difficulties that Olimpia has had is that she and her husband have not had enough money to use as capital to buy necessary supplies.  They need this for their land to be productive, to buy manure, and to pay workers to remove undergrowth.  Due to this lack of money, Olimpia has tried to borrow small amounts of money from family members.  Olimpia now has three hectares of land, which she uses exclusively for crops.  She bought this land with a lot of effort.  Nevertheless, she still needs money in order to continue investing in her land.\r\n\r\nThis is Olimpia's first Kiva loan and she is grateful for the financial support she is receiving in order to get ahead.

They do not have any children yet but live together in their own house.  Since he was 18, Oscar has worked independently, growing cacao, coffee, and other local, profitable products. Oscar works on his two-hectare plot of land with his wife,.  He learned this trade from his parents as, from a young age, he grew up in the country and learned the necessary techniques for this work.  When Oscar started to earn his own income in this work, he was not able to break even on the money he had invested because of a plague and other problems that affected the crops.  This gave Oscar more motivation and a greater desire to do better.  In order to have a better quality harvest, Oscar usually fertilises his land with organic manure.  One of Oscara's future plans is to build his own house - this is something he really needs.  This is Oscar's first Kiva loan and he is grateful for the financial support her is being given in order to get ahead.  He promises to make his repayments on time.

She started her business 9 years ago with a loan from the field partner Hekima.  With her earnings, Ngalya has already completed many microprojects for her family.

She completed only up to second grade at primary school.  Erika works in agriculture, alongside her husband.  They grow coffee together.  They have three children - two of whom are in school, the youngest in kindergarten.   Erika and her husabnd have been growing coffee for over ten years, having learned the trade from their parents.  Erika has always worked growing coffee in order to pay for necessities for her and her family.  Every day she goes to great lengths to keep her harvest healthy and free of plauges, so that she does not suffer any losses.  Erika's land is some 50 metres from her home, and she arrives there on foot.  With a lot of effort and sacrifice, working together as a team, facing challenges such as the low value of coffee in the local and international markets, and dealing with heavy rains, Erika and her husband have been able to prosper in their work - they have no competition in the area.\r\n\r\nErika's plans and dreams for the future, as a farmer and as a mother, are to keep growing crops and to buy more land so that her children can have a better education and can have somewhere to work.  Erika's dream is to see her children have a better quality of life.  She will invest her profits in improving her home.  Erika is applying for a loan from \"COMIXMUL\" in order to buy fertilisers, which are necessary in order to maintain her coffee crops and to have a better yield this season.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1456956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies for her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Jesus de Otoro, Intibuca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T21:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T21:00:28Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-24T22:05:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621334,"name":"Ganbaatar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganbaatar, age 47, became the general manager of a restaurant earlier this year.

age 40, is a farmer. She lives with her husband and child in the Vani district.\r\n\r\nMadona and her husband are actively involved in a family agricultural business. Specifically, they cultivate a piece of land where they grow maize, soy, and nuts. Madona sells the harvest locally and earns a seasonal income. \r\n\r\nShe works throughout each day to generate income, but her earnings are too small to save and improve the family's standard of living. The family lives below the poverty line and receives a small amount of social assistance from the local government.\r\n\r\nMadona would like to start up a clothing sales business in her community in order to earn an additional income.

She is married to Segundo, who is 38 and works in construction. They have three children, who are ages eighteen, seventeen, and fifteen. Mar\u00eda lives with her family in the canton of Salcedo, located in the western part of Cotopaxi, one of the most important provinces on the ecuatorian mountain range. \r\n\r\nThere are several tourist attractions in Salcedo, such as lagoons and resorts that offer extreme sports for adventurous tourists. However, this town's main business is farming, and to a lesser degree, raising livestock. It is also an ideal place for trade because of the tourist traffic and the residents' needs. In spite of these productive activities, there are very concerning illiteracy and poverty rates due to unmet basic needs, such as sewage services, which are only available in 25% of homes. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started farming twenty years ago. When she was very young she decided to carve a niche for herself in this business, which she had been familiar with ever since she was a small child, since her whole family were always farmers. Even though the hardest part was getting her business started, she now invests up to ten hours in this business: from before sunrise until the sun sets. Mar\u00eda grows several crops and also raises domestic animals to later sell, like chickens, quail, etc. \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she is now requesting to buy a dairy cow and to adequately prepare a space for the paddock where it will be kept. This will allow Mar\u00eda to give her children better living standards. Additionally, the extra profit that will come of this will allow her to finish building the second story of her house, a project that has been postponed for a long time due to lacking financial resources. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa for inviting her to work with them and Kiva, because the trust that people all over the world have put in her and her dreams is very encouraging."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":128.05,"image":{"id":1456971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salcedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-10-24T21:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-23T21:20:23Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Targelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1144.03,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":67.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":70.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":71.69},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":76.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":78.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80.14},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83.27},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":85.24},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":86.9},{"due_date":"2014-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":88.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.22},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.31},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.71},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.36},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":59.56,"local_amount":59.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":59.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856362,"comment":null},{"amount":68.49,"local_amount":68.13,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059945,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-25T00:57:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621325,"name":"Batdelger","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batdelger is 33 years old and lives with his wife and children in Darkhan, the second largest city in Mongolia.

He is a husband, father, grandfather and a pharmacist.  He owns a pharmacy near the central hospital.  Right now, Kholmurod is running low on the medicine inventories, and the shelves are becoming empty.  Kholmurod is requesting this loan to buy new medicines.

She is a hard worker and has been engaged in this business for 10 years.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings, when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a common family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and prepare food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than the raw food. This is why Reggie's business has such high demand. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PhP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Reggie is requesting a loan in the amount of PhP 10,000. She will utilize her loan funds to buy greater quantities of such items as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. \r\n\r\nReggie dreams of expanding her business and hopes to gain a better living.

His wife works from home sewing women's dresses. Two of the children are in school, and two are still small. \r\n\r\nMuhidin is taking out a loan to repair and renovate his vehicle.

It is an ideal city for commerce because of tourist traffic and the needs of its inhabitants.  Despite the productive businesses of farming and ranching, there are worrying levels of illiteracy and poverty.  Many basic services, like for example sewage systems, are only in 25% of homes, but the local authorities are working to resolve these issues in every home. \r\n\r\nIn this city of enterprising people lives Hilda, a single, 36-year-old woman with two children whom she has cared for alone and who now help her with her work raising guinea pigs for sale.  The guinea pig is an animal that is sold in Ecuador as both a pet and as food in different parts of the country, where it is served with potatoes and peanut sauce.  Hilda has been selling these animals for 10 years and she spends at least four hours a day, seven days a week with them to deliver her customers well-cared-for, strong animals.  This earns her customers' trust and their recommendations to new people who are looking for these animals.  \r\n\r\nHilda needs a loan to improve the animals' nurseries and to buy feed that is more nutritious for them.

He hopes to keep up the hard work spirit and achieve his set goals in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79.17,"image":{"id":1453442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more items for his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T02:10:08Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dankani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2014-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:27:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100145.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429636153,"comment":null},{"amount":39.59,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100145.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-24T01:05:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621474,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi is a very hard-working woman who wishes to get ahead through her own efforts and wants her working life to be much more successful.

Unfortunately, Merab was unable to obtain a loan from existing financial institutions, as they require a stable income and business experience as a precondition to a loan.

The group consists of 10 female micro-entrepreneurs from Brazzaville, Congo. Mireille is a single mother of two children, ages 12 and 23 years old. She is very excited to be receiving her first loan from HOPE Congo. She has had her business for around six years. Her business consists primarily of selling small pastries and local juices. With this next loan, she will be able to buy more of the ingredients she needs to make her juice and pastries.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \n\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \n\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\n\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\n\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\n\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory.

His mother had to raise him all by herself, in poverty, which prompted Juan to quit school in order to work to help her. Juan is married and has two sons. He has been a farmer since he was ten years old, since he learned the trade from his mother and from a neighbour. He also works as a bricklayer, a trade he learned from a man who gave him work so that he would be able to help his mother. At the beginning, it was only simple tasks such as wetting the bricks, but Juan was always observing how the man actually laid the bricks in order to learn to do it himself. Upon noticing this, the man taught him how to do it. Juan is very grateful to this man today, since what he learned from him helps him provide for his family. He is now trying his hand at growing loroco, tomatoes, and passion fruit. He wakes up very early in order to milk the family cow and then commutes to work, which takes him about 45 minutes. His wife takes care of leading the cow to pasture. The loan Juan asks for will be used to buy a heifer, and, with the remaining sum, he will buy 4 sacks of manure, 2 litres of herbicide, 3 litres of fertiliser, and 1 litre of fungicide (this to rid his vegetables from fungi). Juan's dreams for the future are: to buy a car in order to take his produce to market (he has high hopes for his vegetables as well); to see his children graduate from university, a boon he himself was denied; and to build a house of his own, since the one he currently inhabits belongs to a brother-in-law."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1457723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a heifer as well as agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-10-25T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-24T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Enmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-22T07:45:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621576,"name":"Sergey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sergey lives with his parents.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

With a little money from her husband five years ago, she was able to establish her table business where she sells palm oil. She spends 10 hours per day on her business, Monday to Saturday. A problem she faces is a low income. She is requesting a loan to purchase more palm oil for her business.

Her son's family lives in an old house on a plot of land. She is afraid that their newly born child may get sick as the cold winter is coming closer.

","en":"Hena is 78 years old and used to work in an office.  When she stopped this work and when she separated from her husband, things became difficult.  In order to earn an income, Hena relied on a friend, who gave her products to sell.  Hena started her business, putting this work as her top priority.  It was not easy to sell cosmetics and other merchandise.  She was not used to this work but she did it, visiting work colleagues, and gradually, she developed a customer base, collecting the money from her sales on credit, and buying products in the city to fulfill her orders.  Hena has workied with four businesses that sell through catalogues for five years.  With the income she makes, Hena has been able to organise her store, buying display cases and stocking up.  Lately Hena has been selling independently from catalogues.  Hena buys products when prices are low, so that she can offer competitive prices to her customers.  Hena mainly sells on credit, collecting the money within two months (on average), depending on the amount the customer buys and how much it cost.  Although Hena lives in a rented property with her son, Hena has stock that she displays in her sister's house, which is nearby.  Hena is very hard-working and also has a monthly income - she earns a percentage from the city raffle, for which she sells tickets.  She also hops to win a house and a car.  Hena's customers usually buy from her, and so Hena considers them as her regulars.  This is Hena's fifth loan with the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\".  With this resource she has been able to increase her profits.  She has new customers and this helps her to improve her quality of life.  Because of this she is grateful for this support and hopes that the foundation can continue to help her.

She now has two stalls in the city market, where she sells for cash and on credit every day.  She buys from distributors who offer her good prices.  Claudia sells to her main customers, street vendors, and to passers-by, who are attracted by the stalls.  Claudia has had two loans from the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\".  With these she has been able to expand her business, and have a greater amount of stock, giving her the chance to offer more choice to her customers.  Claudia's biggest challenge is the competition but, little by little, Claudia's experience has helped her to win over customers from her competitors.  Claudia is applying for a Kiva, which she will use to buy clothes, women's accessories, DIY products, and toys.

These products earn more money on the market and make it easier to keep the farm profitable, but the energy required to heat and transform the milk is both expensive and damaging to the environment.

Juan will be able to generate enough biogas to virtually eliminate his LP gas use while concurrently receiving an additional resource - valuable biofertilizer to use on his forage crops. \r\n\r\nThis investment will result in a virtuous cycle; the waste produced by Juan's cows will turn into energy used to heat the milk they produce into cheese and yogurt, as well as biofertilizer that will result in more food for them.

Also found here are diverse microenterprises operated by entrepreneurs who struggle every day to achieve their dreams.

The area also has various tourist attractions such as waterfalls, rivers, paths and swimming areas, where tourists are attracted by the adventure sport services offered there with guaranteed safety. \r\n\r\nIn view of the need to supply the necessities for her children, Lourdes saw the need to start a business on her own initiative, raising chickens.
