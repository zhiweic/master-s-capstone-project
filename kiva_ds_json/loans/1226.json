has a variety store and she used her loan to buy grocery items and toiletries.

Her income from the business helped her family with their everyday expenses at home. She and her husband are helping each other in managing their business, and in providing for their family.\r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for another 50,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs, and for her child\u2019s education expense. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nAngeli dreams of expanding her business, and hopes that her children will have a good future. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 32 years old and married.  She says that she started her business by buying clothes from the first loan until she was able to sell them to customers around her area.

This will allow her to speed up the sorting process, so that she can later sell everything that she has collected and make available the money that has up to now been sitting in the storeroom as recycling material. \r\n\r\nAracely dreams of continuing with her work, so that in the future, she will be able to obtain a vehicle that she can use to transport the recycling on her own.

graduated from secondary school this year and is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of Business Administration. Here is his story:\r\n\r\n\"Studying at school, we gain knowledge and skills for future development. But there is a day when we finish school and stand at a crossroads, where every road is a path on which we will go into the future. It is known that everyone has their own aptitudes and wishes. Based on these, we choose our path. \r\n\r\nIn the future, I want to be a specialist who can speak the language of business and administration. I am sure that education, training, and the ability to work, which I received at the Lyceum, can go on by learning the program of Business Administration at the American University of Central Asia.\r\n \r\nThe choice of this career, first of all, associates with a rapidly developing system and market relations in the daily life of our country and the world.\r\nWhereas before, during the Soviet system, everything was decided by the state authorities in the form of state plans and five-year plans. Nowadays we are living in times of market economy and all ways are open for business. If you have the necessary knowledge, you can open your own business and develop it, or realize yourself in a variety of business firms, cooperation and government organizations.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, I chose a path \u2013 studying the laws of business and administration. For this, first of all, I consider it is necessary to get a quality education, and I\u2019m sure at AUCA I can get it because in our country, only there that appropriate education is given. After learning that the business administration program at AUCA is the leading business program in our region, I definitely stopped my choice on it. In addition, the fact that many of AUCA graduates continue their education at the universities of the United States, Europe, and other major countries also affected me.\r\n\r\nThe school where I studied, I was tough to work, having explained to me a simple postulate, which states that the work is the result of my own efforts and leads to quality education. In 10th grade, I began to participate in the Olympiad on mathematics. But then I was advised by my teacher to take history. I won it twice and then I took second place in Republican Olympiad.\r\n \r\nIn the future, I would like to become a professional who is able to manage large business projects where new, innovative, and creative ideas and programs will be generated and implemented. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my parents cannot afford paying the tuition fees fully. But AUCA gives a very good opportunity to its students. All the students of AUCA have an opportunity to get Kiva loans to cover the tuition fees. So, I am applying for a Kiva loan, which will help cover the fees.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1429310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Lots of school children were representing other countries too and I was so proud to represent my country.\r\n\r\nIt was an exciting trip, and I won bronze medal for my presentation. I wished I've won 1st though. But I am sure, I will be able to do so in the future. While in Turkey, I deeply felt how much I love my country, and I represented all the best things we have: our national dress, our hospitality, etc. \r\n\r\nMoreover, my presentation was about \u201cManas\u201d, which I think was a great thing to share with others.

I am an active person and try to take part in all social events actively. I have a volunteering experience: there is a relief fund for orphans and older people in our secondary school. We organized volunteer groups and visited an orphanage, named 'Meerim bulagy.'  Our group picked up clothes, toys and bought food and presented them, but the most important thing that we came to share our love and care with them. We organized concert, sang songs, danced and played. In the end, children didn\u2019t want to let us go. Besides, I visited a home for the elderly and sometimes brought them to school, where we organized a holiday for them. I also work in Resource Centre for the old people in Kyrgyzstan since February. \r\n\r\n\"I hope both my educational background and my volunteering experience will help me to be one of the best students of AUCA.

There are lots of required and well-paid professions nowadays and AUCA gives an opportunity for students to choose and study according to their interests. \r\n\r\n\"A reason of my desire to study at AUCA is that I am fond of mathematics, economics and even international relations with other countries. Economics is one of the most important sciences, which helps to develop the world\u2019s living conditions and relations among the people from different countries. I think it is amazing to forecast the future decrease or increase of economics situation, estimate all important object and sources and make correct decisions which will determine my future success.

is a student of the American University of Central Asia, department of International and Comparative Politics, and below is his story. \r\n\r\n\u201cMy name is Parviz. I have graduated the Aga Khan Lycee in Khorog, Tajikistan. It was my dream to study at AUCA, department of International and Comparative Politics, and I am really happy that I\u2019ve been admitted to this program. I am interested in this field because my society faces many problems related to politics that need specialists who are able to bring changes to the system of policies that lead to the development of my society. My interest in the subject grew when we studied economics, history, law and humanities in my ninth to eleventh grades and through my involvement in the sessions conducted in American Corner, a project of the US Embassy. \r\n\r\nThe last few years of school, I was involved in a number of extracurricular activities. One of those was organizing charity competitions between youth in my local area last year. The aim of the competitions was to help sick or poor people with the money received from the competitions. People of different ages participate in competitions of various kinds of sports like volleyball, basketball, football, tennis, etc. The collected money was directed to help people in need; for medical treatment. These competitions became a positive push for school children, and now there are already several groups taking part in these competitions as well. Apart from sports, I also play guitar and sing. I think this experience will allow me to take an active part in the extracurricular activities of the university to make it interesting.\r\n\r\nI live in a family of five: my parents, two siblings and myself. Education is very important for my family. Therefore, one of my important aims is to increase the financial situation in my family through education. My siblings also study at the Aga Khan Lycee, which has a monthly tuition fee, so it is unaffordable for my parents to pay for all of us. The tuition fees will increase much more than it before, when three of us studied in the Lycee. I hope to get financial support to pursue my further education at the American University of Central Asia \u2013 the University of dreams.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1431924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for his higher education.

But because of the drought and other weather related conditions he lost half of the harvest every year. This made a big damage to their family's budget. Later he has decided to start doing animal husbandry and received additional income from it which helped him cover all family expenses. At this time Daler started another type of business and bought a truck to buy and sell coal. He buys coal from another region and sells to the local residents. Right now is the beginning of the winter season and people start to stock up on coal for heating. Daler has come to Arvand and wants to get a loan to buy coal. He hopes for a positive outcome and is thanking Arvand in advance for the support.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1437759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T07:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T07:50:01Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daler","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":122.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":128.68},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":134.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.72},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":157.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.23},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.68},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.72},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.1},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.4},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.23},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.76},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614449,"name":"Frank","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Frank, 46 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, tiene 2 hijos, oriundo del departamento del Beni.

They live in traditional extended families in the Heremakono Nord district in the village of Bougoni. They know each other as neighbors and friends as well as through their work. In order to bolster their financial capital and improve their businesses, they have joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution and are now on their third loan. Their two prior loans have been duly repaid. The group members work as vendors and cook food for sale, which is what Diala does, for example. Diala is the first one seated from right to left in the photo. She plans to use her loan to buy 200 kg [441 lbs] of rice and condiments from wholesalers in Bamako. She sells her cooked dishes at the marketplace and out of her home, retail, for cash and on credit, to a mixed clientele. She plans to  earn an average monthly revenue of 35,000 West African francs, which will be used to reinvest in her business and pay off her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1087.5,"image":{"id":1443184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for cooking food for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T15:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T15:00:01Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Assetou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175759.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972495,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":175759.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625059,"comment":null},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":175759.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851070,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T16:56:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":614678,"name":"Tuhimizane Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"La cliente Maombi est une commer\u00e7ante et membre du groupe  d\u2019affaire \u00ab  Tuhimizane \u00bb, \u00e2g\u00e9e  de 35 ans m\u00e8re de 5 enfants qui \u00e9tudient.

The mother of six children, she lives with her spouse and their children in a polygamous family in Hamdallaye, one of the neighborhoods surrounding Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ms. Mariatou has run a traditional soap-making business for about nine years. The traditional soap is used primarily by women for laundry. The soap she makes is sold from her home and at the market, where she is very sought after by her clientele for the quality of her products. To meet the increasingly growing needs of her clientele, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She is on her second individual loan, which she expects to use to purchase two barrels of potassium and 50 kilograms of shea butter. She buys her primary materials to produce the soap there in Sikasso. Her clientele is primarily made up of men and women. Her previous loans were properly repaid. She imagines that with this loan she will make a monthly profit of 80,000 f CFA , which will be used to increase her business funds, contribute to her family's expenses and pay the interest on the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1443232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase soap-making ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2014-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972496,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625060,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":36364.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T19:56:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611923,"name":"Rasheeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasheeda, age 56, deals in the business of animal sales.

name of Mutabar was born. From early childhood Mutabar loved nature and animals. She would grow plants in her bedroom and helped her parents breed animals. She grew up  to be a kind, well-behaved girl. Like all village women Mutabar is very hard working. She is a caring mother and an understanding wife. Mutabar's husband Suyunboi works on the field and grows various crops. But Suyunboi's work is seasonal. Outside of harvest they rear animals. In doing this job they follow in the footsteps of their parents. In the village, the fattening, purchasing and selling of livestock is a profitable and attractive business. In order to develop her business Mutabar contacted MDO Arvand to ask for a loan, for at the moment she does not have enough money. With the proposed loan, Mutabar plans to buy livestock and hopes that MDO Arvand will support Mutabar in the implementation of her own business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":148.99,"image":{"id":1439077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mutabar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2014-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2014-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98.86},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.34},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.48},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.3},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.36},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.64},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.86},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.44},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.65,"local_amount":73.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":73.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550194,"comment":null},{"amount":75.34,"local_amount":75.34,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":75.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774415,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-28T23:35:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611931,"name":"Musrat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musrat is a 36-year-old, married woman.

In this way, she currently runs a business buying and selling tubers (potatoes, yams and spuds) and various small goods at the market, where she is very sought after by her clientele for the quality of her products. To satisfy the increasingly growing needs of her clientele, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. She is on her thirteenth individual loan, which she expects to use to buy 70 bags of tubers. She buys her merchandise there in Sikasso before reselling it at retail for cash to a clientele made up of men and women. The previous loans were all properly repaid. She imagines that with this loan she will make a monthly profit of 100,000 f CFA which will be used to increase her business funds, contribute to her family's expenses, and to pay the interest on the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1443225,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase tubers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-10-01T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-31T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":169699.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851071,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T19:51:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":611943,"name":"Rifat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rifat is a 30-year-old married woman.

","en":"Kulurukan is 55 years old and a widow. After her husband's death, she has been raising three children and running her own farm. Kulurukan has a secondary education. The family's primary income comes from animal husbandry. Kulurukan started her farm 29 years ago when she purchased cattle with 2,000 KGS. Because of Kulurukan's hard work, her farm now has two foals and 0.96 hectares of a land share, which she uses to grow potatoes and clover every year. She earns a monthly income of 7,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Kulurukan has asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a bull for cattle breeding. Kulurukan plans to invest money she makes from the loan to increase the number of domestic animals she owns and to save enough money to repair her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":104.17,"image":{"id":1443041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy

She is married.  Her husband left to work abroad.  While her husband is away from the family, Sakovat is raising their two sons alone in the city of Isfara and is concurrently involved in sewing.  Sakovat worked at a market, selling children's clothing, several years ago.  She could no longer work when she had children and stopped that business.  Today, her sons have grown up a bit - the oldest is 5 years old, and the youngest is 2 years old.  Sakovat can work again, and her mother, who lives together with them, will look after the children in her absence.

is from Gyumri town. It has already been 10 years since Vahan started providing telephone services. Particularly he provides telephone connections abroad and gives locals an opportunity to talk with their relatives abroad.  As the emigration rate of Armenia is very high and almost every household here has a relative abroad, Vahan's service is in high demand. Due to his hard work over these 10 years, Vahan was able to form a client base that only uses his provided service. Now, this hardworking young man needs financial support to be able to make network improvements and pay for a new connection which has higher quality and speed. \r\nVahan has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products.  This loan is very important for Vahan to be able to expand his business and provide better quality service to his customers.  Vahan lives together with his parents and brother and is the only breadwinner of the family.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1438680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call

Their friendship is very valuable. Felipa, the group's representative, is 42. She has been married to Jose Eduardo for 25 years, and together they have three children, who are in school. Felipa has worked selling beauty products out of a catalogue for 12 years. She says that she started this activity because she was invited to sell catalogue beauty products. She offered her beauty products to her friends, neighbors, and relatives. She liked this a lot because she had a lot of customers. \"At first, I did not like it, because I did not trust people, but over time, I have made many friends. I've kept selling because there are also prizes when one reaches a goal.\" After a long time, Felipa is now the leader of a group of people who also work selling beauty products out of a catalogue. For Felipa, this is a very comfortable job, because it does not require a lot of time. She can offer her catalogues while she does other things, like look after her children. The members of the group are very glad for the opportunity to get a loan funded by people from different countries, because it will be very helpful for their businesses.

She is requesting a loan to buy more red oil, rice, coal, etc. to expand her sales. She wants to get more money to educate her children.

She hopes they will become successful professionals, which is her biggest challenge. She earns income to support the household's wellbeing through sales. She primarily sells clothing and shoes in her business, which she started six years ago. She is a skilled businesswoman, which is why upon winning a prize, she bought two glass cabinets and slowly filled them with merchandise when she began to get money, she put it into her business. She sells items on cash and credit, offering shirts, jeans, sweaters, and sports shoes. She works Monday through Sunday, eight hours a day. \r\n\r\nHer main customers are her friends and neighbors in the area. She buys items and stocks up for customers who pay in cash. She offers these regular customers good deals on prices and products. Her goal is to increase her business and turn it into a large store.

My hometown is Jeruklegi Wetan village, Jeruklegi Subdistric, Cilacap Regency, Central Java Province. Geographically hilly and rocky, the road is bad and far away from a big city. \n\nMy mother is a walker food seller. Their salary per month is only Rp (Rupiah) 600,000. The job of my father is a brick layer. He works only when someone needs him to build or renovate something, such as a house, walls, etc. But if no one employs him, he is jobless.The amount of children in family is four. Their ages are 23, 22, 15 (me), and 6 years old. The children who still study at school are I and my younger sister, Salsa. If I am given the Kiva loan from lenders, I will spend it to pay my school fees.\n\nAt school, most of my time table is accounting lessons because my majority is accounting. Besides that, I also learn other lessons, such as English, civil, math, Indonesian language and so on. I chose this study program because someday I want to be a financial administrator at a company. The fun thing at school is I have and meet new things and new friends.\n\nIn the picture, Sayem and her daughter,
