In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNeriza dreams of giving her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

According to Jonas, he has another stall at Diffun Quirino. Three of his helpers manage his stall at Diffun, while Jonas is responsible for running his stall located at the Public Market of Cordon. He aims to earn a greater income so he can uplift his family's living condition out of poverty and educate his two children. For now, he struggles because of inadequate capital due to an increase of household expenses and rentals for his stalls. With regard to his situation, he requested a loan of PHP 18,000, which allows him to buy more fresh coconut.

Fatima is 51-year-old energetic woman. She is doing a business of gloves sewing for 10 years. She is a married woman and has nine children. Her husband is employed as an operator but his income is insufficient to cover all the household expenditures. \r\n\r\nFatima started her own business with very little capital; she had not a single machine. But with the support of Kashf Foundation, she has bought her own machine. She is very popular in her street and has gained many customers. She makes enough to lead a decent life. To help her continue her operations, she requested for a loan of Rs.30,000 to purchase another sewing machine for her daughter to assist her in fulfilling orders of the customers.

Annet hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house. \r\n\r\nAnnet is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Sarwar is a 51-year-old active woman. She has been in the business of making fabric with her husband for the past eight years. When she started this business, her income was very low but with the passage of time her business income increased, which is only due to her passion to give a better future to her kids. She is illiterate, so she wants to see her children well educated. \r\n\r\nShe has two machines.

Pastor\u2019s goal is to increase production to 18 tons annually in three years because although he has sufficient land to do so he needs to plant more plants because many of the ones he has are old and don\u2019t produce much anymore which is why he needs the loan.\r\n\r\nPastor delivers his entire coffee production to a local gathering center for subsequent shipment to \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d [coffee cooperative] that processes and exports it.

She lives with Hilario who provides transportation services.  They have a daughter, Lily, who is 30-years-old.  They live together comfortably in their own house with their two grandchildren they love very much.\r\n\r\nTezalia\u2019s activity is providing mototaxi passenger transportation services.  She bought the mototaxi with her savings and a private loan.  At the beginning, they leased it out but seeing how it became worn down quickly due to the poor handling it got she and her spouse decided it would be better if he drove it himself and provided the services.  She started out three years ago with the purchase of her first vehicle and in time she\u2019s refurbished other units that would become worn down through daily usage.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it generates income to cover family expenses.  She started this activity because she needed to have a source of income because she had been unable to secure employment; now she feels more secure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she comments that she doesn\u2019t like it when her mototaxi breaks down often because this causes her unplanned expenses but even so she gets good results that are reflected in her profits.  She plans to make progress and to be able to buy more mototaxis and expand her fleet of vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis is her 5th MFP loan.  She\u2019s very happy with the financial support she\u2019s getting because she\u2019ll feel more confident this way of moving forward with her work.  On the other hand, she commits to continue making her payments punctually as scheduled.  She\u2019s very happy to be part of her communal bank because they are all very responsible and supportive.  She will use the requested 300 new soles to reupholster her mototaxi\u2019s seats to provide greater comfort for the passengers who access her service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1211260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to reupholster the seats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tezalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.73},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":46.81,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447713,"comment":null},{"amount":18.89,"local_amount":45.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":49.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053614,"comment":null},{"amount":20.6,"local_amount":49.43,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":53.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188551,"comment":null},{"amount":21.36,"local_amount":51.27,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":55.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572465,"comment":null},{"amount":21.73,"local_amount":52.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":56.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122127,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":59.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-11T18:49:03Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480771,"name":"Injieh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Injieh is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband appears in her Kiva profile photo.

She lost her job after the breakup of the Soviet Union and, in search of a source of income for her family, became involved in sales of sewn goods, having started this business with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Talchakan's hard work and persistence, the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS).  Despite the business losses during the unrest of 2010, she was able to survive and develop her business.  In order to further develop her business, Talchakan requested a loan in the amount of 85,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand the merchandise selection by buying winter clothing.

She became involved in organizing public food service by working at a cafe 1.5 years ago.  Having started the business with a sum of 25,000 som, Dilbara was able to lease a cafe space for 32 seats and a tandoor (clay oven for making bakery products) for making sams (national meat pies).  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, the monthly profit from the business now amounts to about 20,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Dilbara requested a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase equipment - a refrigerator and a cafe display.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business in order to subsequently buy out the cafe and also to start an animal husbandry business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1214063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a refrigerator and a cafe display","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Osh","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4807},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4760},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4894},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5033},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5176},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5322},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5473},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5628},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5788},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5952},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6120},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6047}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.41},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.48},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.82},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":103.54,"local_amount":4807,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-28T09:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4875.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315330001,"comment":null},{"amount":102.52,"local_amount":4760,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4827.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938783,"comment":null},{"amount":105.41,"local_amount":4894,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4963.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331071264,"comment":null},{"amount":1088.53,"local_amount":50539,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-16T11:23:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51259.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459686,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-12T03:13:52Z","paid_date":"2013-02-16T11:23:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480764,"name":"Kadiatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 33-year-old Kadiatu from Moriba town in the southern area in Bo, Sierra Leone.

To provide an income for her family, she is involved in selling food products.  Thanks to Mubarak's hard work, the monthly income from the business yields about 15,000 som (KGS), which serves as the base for covering the family's expenses for food and basic needs.  Considering the special friendliness of the owner and a good selection of products, Mubarak has a large number of customers visiting her store, which required the involvement of the entire family in the business.  Today, Mubarak's son and daughter-in-law help her at the store, and her husband also provides feasible assistance.  In order to further develop her business, Mubarak requested a loan in the amount of 115,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a car for timely transportation of products to the store.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing her business in order to build a big house for her family in the

He would like to invest in the purchase of new tools and equipment to process the metal pieces for his art. He has been selling through NOVICA since 2007. This is his story:\n\n\"I'm a self-taught and impassioned artist; I was only a 13-year-old child when I began to make my own toys. I used to tear apart other toys and use their components to create my own versions. That's how I got into making sculptures, but this time by recycling mechanical parts. One day, when I was working on the sculpture of a medieval knight, I was missing some pieces so I went to a friend's auto-shop. He said I could take anything I needed from a metal box he had lying around. Three days later my friend came by and asked about some pieces he needed, which he had left outside the box. Needless to say, I had taken them, but they were already welded into the sculpture. I had to go with my friend to meet the owner of the truck for which those parts were originally intended, and explain to him they were now part of a sculpture.

This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"My mother is a senior 'ate' grass weaver in our village. My grandfather taught me to print Balinese handwriting on palm leaves as well as to carve images on this leaf. When demand grew for 'ate' products, I saw it as a challenge to learn how to make these too. Weaving this durable island grass is not as hard as people may think, but it's not easy work either.

","en":"Julyet has worked in retail for many years, and a few days ago, she opened her own shop in which she sells a variety of goods such as apparel, personal care products, and a wide variety of other merchandise. Despite the fact that she launched her business with very little capital, her hard work has allowed her to expand her shop little by little, thus earning the money she needs to cover the household expenses as she lives with her husband and 6-year-old son. Because she has received many orders from customers and does not have the working capital to fill them, Julyet is seeking a loan that will allow her to purchase more merchandise and meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to make her business prosperous and increase the household earnings, as well as offer her husband and son a better quality of life so that they have the financial means to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1201484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

To supplement the income, he also works for others in the local area for a fee. His daily income is approximately 20,000 KHR and he manages to save about 10,000 KHR each day after deducting daily expenses. The scarcity of working capital is the main challenge for his rice-paddy.\r\n\r\nSern has been with VisionFund for two loan cycles while the other member has been with VisionFund for three cycles. The past loans, which were fully paid back, have relieved his family\u2019s burden and improved their livelihood. Now he and his group member are applying for a new loan of 1,500,000 KHR and 4,000,000 KHR respectively. As the leader, Sern will use his portion to buy fertilizer for his rice and cassava cultivated land and use a portion of it to spend on labor costs. He hopes this loan will enable his crop yield to become more profitable so as to sell it for a good price and fulfill his dream to expand his plantation business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1210283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer for his rice and cassava cultivated land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-11T22:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-10T22:20:01Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sern","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":5500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":5500000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5542622.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347197480,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-21T01:32:07Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480964,"name":"03-03-03-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. L\u01b0u has a retail business selling dry food.

Ahora, Melva ha tenido una gran oportunidad que espera pueda cambiar su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y mejorar en todos los aspectos su calidad de vida; pues ha podido comprar el puesto de comidas r\u00e1pidas donde ha trabajado durante 10 a\u00f1os. Como no cuenta con mucho capital, ahora no tiene el dinero suficiente para surtir insumos, es por esto que busca un pr\u00e9stamo que le permita comprar insumos como panes, salsas, carnes, entre otros y comenzar a trabajar con su propio negocio.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es poder sacar su propio negocio adelante y mejorar su calidad de vida gracias a unos mejores ingresos y poder ofrecer a su familia un futuro mejor y m\u00e1s estable. \n","en":"Melva always has been very hardworking and this has allowed her to overcome the great adversity she has faced in life.  About 10 years ago she began to work as an employee in a fast-food business in the main park in her town.  Her income as an employee wasn't enough to support her household, so she also sold personal products to family members and neighbors.\r\n\r\nCurrently Melva has had a great opportunity that she hopes can change her financial situation and improve her quality of life in all respects: she has been able to buy the food stall where she has worked for 10 years. \r\n\r\nShe doesn't have much capital now, so she doesn't have sufficient money to stock supplies.  This is why she's looking for a loan that will allow her to buy supplies such as bread, sauce, meat, and others, and begin to work with her own business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to get her own business ahead and improve her quality of life, thanks to some better income, and to be able to give her family a better and more stable future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":871.9,"image":{"id":1213318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has now been in this line of work for four years. She felt very nervous at the beginning, but with time she was able to develop her best qualities and now she sells a great deal and is very happy about it. What she most enjoys about her job is talking to her customers and making them laugh. She considers the most difficult part to be selling under the hot morning sun. Diana would love to have an actual candy store where she could sell with greater comfort and be able to offer her customers a wider variety of products.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through Microfinanzas Prisma.

She is a single mother with a 14-year-old son who depends on her for his food and  education. Melita works hard every day to be able to give him a better quality of life. She lives in her own house, together with her siblings and father. Melita works primarily transporting passengers on her motorcycle. She gets up very early to drive her mototaxi through the city streets in search of people who need transportation from one place to another. She has dedicated herself to this work for 16 years, which has allowed her to pay to feed her son and send him to school, as well as advance financially. Melita also has a car wash installed in her house and she complements this with the sale of different lubricants, motor accessories, and motortaxis.\r\n\r\nFortunately, her financial earnings keep growing, giving her the peace of mind she needs in order to continue working day after day. She works with the help of her brother and her father. What she likes about her job is that she can organize her time in her own way. She does not have a fixed work schedule, so, in this way, she can devote herself to all of her activities and ensure they run smoothly. So far, everything is going well for Melita and she hopes to continue that way until she must take on other responsibilities. \r\n\r\nThis is Melita's eleventh loan, so she thanks everyone who helps make it possible for her to access this financing. With it, she she will feel safer about advancing her business. On the other hand, she promises to punctually make all of her payments and, in this way, be assured and supported by the other members of her communal bank. Melita requests a total of 1500 soles that she will use to refurbish some parts of her car wash, to make some repairs to her motortaxi, and to buy some lubricants and oils to sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1213435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","use":"air condition her car wash and buy motor lubricants and oils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T12:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T12:20:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":239.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":248.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":267.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":276.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.93},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.95},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":86.98,"local_amount":217.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":225.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447720,"comment":null},{"amount":95.93,"local_amount":239.82,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":249.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053623,"comment":null},{"amount":99.51,"local_amount":248.77,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":258.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188560,"comment":null},{"amount":100.19,"local_amount":250.49,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":260.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572474,"comment":null},{"amount":106.95,"local_amount":267.38,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":277.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122136,"comment":null},{"amount":110.44,"local_amount":276.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":286.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867972,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives with her husband, Edinson, and their two children who are 16- and 12-years old, respectively.  The family share their house with Monica's parents.  Monica has operated a clothing sales business for 20 years.  She sells a range of clothing pieces of various styles and sizes, for all ages and for men as well as women.  She also sells footwear.  She reviews and adjusts her inventory once a month, depending on what she expects to sell.  She counts on a relative, who lives in the town from which she receives her merchandise, to order whatever she needs for the business.  Two years ago, she added beauty products--creams, perfumes, face powder, etc.--to the range of merchandise that she sells.  She works alone and says that she is pleased with her progress.  The business suits her because she is friendly and charismatic, with an easy manner that makes it easy for her to attract new customers.  The business is profitable and she can organize her time so that she can both work and take care of her family without neglecting either.   For the future, she would like to open a shop of her own.  This will be Monica's 14th MFP loan and she says that she is grateful that this means of borrowing is accessible for businesses like hers.  She says, too, that she is committed to repaying the loan in the agreed-upon time and that the trust she's gained from the other members of her community bank is important to her.  Monica will use this loan (S\/.1000) to stock her business with clothes, shoes and accessories.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1213439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to stock her clothing sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":144.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":159.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.9},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":178.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":184.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.31},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":144.88,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447721,"comment":null},{"amount":63.92,"local_amount":159.8,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053624,"comment":null},{"amount":66.31,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":172.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188561,"comment":null},{"amount":66.76,"local_amount":166.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572475,"comment":null},{"amount":71.26,"local_amount":178.16,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":185.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122137,"comment":null},{"amount":73.8,"local_amount":184.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":191.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867973,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T09:21:07Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481112,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi is a married woman and the mother of five children.

She has been doing this for three years and sometimes she gets her spouse's support, who has a vehicle and helps her transporting the merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe feels very satisfied because she is doing very well in this first stage. She loves this job because it leaves her enough time when she is not working in order to take care of the household chores in a comfortable way. Besides, she has earned her customers' respect and confidence, through a good treatment and through her big smile. She makes good sales and as a result she obtains good profits.

In the future, he also hopes to operate a new business, which is a sugarcane-growing business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1211051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer and pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ponhea Krek district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-10-12T14:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-11T14:20:01Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sorn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1009734.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837930,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1009734.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399942240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T08:02:58Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T18:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":481139,"name":"Nan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A rural villager residing in Dambae district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, Nan is a 37-year-old father of six children.
