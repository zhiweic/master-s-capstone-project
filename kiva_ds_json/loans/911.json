This loan will enable her to have her own hand tractor so as to increase her family\u2019s income to make a living better.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1146181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a hand tractor for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T02:50:44Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T02:50:44Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chanthorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":408300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315519079,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51037.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265686,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":255187.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837593,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-28T03:38:51Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:03:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":452330,"name":"Saroeut","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saroeut is a 56-year-old widow and mother of three children and lives in a rural village in the Ek Phnom district of Battambang province, Cambodia.

She started her business at a very small level and expanded it gradually. \n\nIn order to fast-track her business growth, she utilized financing from Kashf last year and paid all her installments on time. That loan played a vital role in her business growth by fostering new orders from clients. \n\nNow she needs a loan of PKR 20,000 to purchase raw materials for her business, e.g., thread, embroidery needles, fabrics, etc.\n\nRobina, with the help of her husband, is very keen to expand this business to a high level because now they have good orders and committed clients with them.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1147686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to purchase

Although the price of feed is currently very expensive, Ketut expects the sale of four pigs would gain a satisfactory profit and can increase the income of her husband to support her family and helping her children's school fees.\n\nIn the current period, there was a decrease of the loan amount. This is because they've got enough profit from previous sales to provide capital.

Jos\u00e9 has always helped his mother in the sale of fritters and bollos, both accompaniments of the preferred foods of families at breakfast time and during dinner. Some time ago he had to take over the business himself, since his mother became sick. Now he has the daily goal of generating enough income to sustain the family, as well as studying and becoming a good professional. His dream is to make his microbusiness grow and generate more income every day, but his working capital is insufficient to broach new markets, which is his greatest challenge.  This is why he has turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that he has had with Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which he will buy raw materials and ingredients such as corn, cheese, and oil, since he plans to increase his sales of bollos, cheese turnovers, and empanadas, opening new markets in which he can obtain regular customers.

is 47 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is married and has six children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past three years, Getrude has been working hard to manage her shop, which sells video tapes, CDs and DVDs. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Getrude has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase another computer, video tapes, CDs and DVDs. This will help Getrude to generate greater profits so she can expand the business. Getrude hopes that in the future she will be able to live a good life. \r\n\r\nGetrude is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Getrude who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1152209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes &

Magellan is a retailer and has been selling mobile phones and accessories for 3 years in one of the districts of the economic capital. The sale of mobile phone accessories is a profitable area of business, but Magellan faces the problem of having insufficient inventory with which to fulfill demand, as his capital does not enable him to restock quickly enough for the customers who are left waiting. This is a problem which is causing his sales and customer numbers to progressively diminish. He would therefore like this loan so that he is able to buy a large amount of phone accessories and avoid stock shortages, which will will enable him to respond to customer demand and raise his profits. The profits will allow him to develop his business and, above all, to meet his family's needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1153515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy mobile phone accessories (batteries, chargers, smart cards).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Douala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T12:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T12:10:10Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magellan Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20707},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21488},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":22268},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23048},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23829},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":24610},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25391},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26171},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":26951},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27732},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28513},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":29292}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":20707,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":21439.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072045,"comment":null},{"amount":41.18,"local_amount":21488,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":22248.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306444,"comment":null},{"amount":42.68,"local_amount":22268,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":23055.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914784,"comment":null},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":23048,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":23863.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331047027,"comment":null},{"amount":45.67,"local_amount":23829,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T13:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":24671.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339436819,"comment":null},{"amount":47.17,"local_amount":24610,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25480.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346989239,"comment":null},{"amount":48.67,"local_amount":25391,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":26289.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356622856,"comment":null},{"amount":50.16,"local_amount":26171,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T08:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":27096.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364437012,"comment":null},{"amount":215.6,"local_amount":112488,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116467.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372842086,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-30T09:51:21Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T08:55:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454575,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 40 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He will use the Kes 85,500 loan to buy a water tank worth Kes 78,000 and the rest loan proceeds worth Kes 7,500 to pay for the installation of the water tank. His business goal is to buy a lorry to help in delivering building stones\/bricks to customers within 5 years. He hopes that in the future, his business will have been successful.

This business is doing quite well as, thanks to his experience as a salesman, he has managed to build a loyal client\u00e8le which is growing every day.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the demand for wedding hats is growing, Serges Bertrand is finding it difficult to fulfill the needs of his customers as he is constantly suffering from stock shortages and his capital does not allow him to get adequate supplies. He would therefore like to get this loan so that he can increase his inventory of wedding hats, which will enable him to satisfy his customers and not lose them. The profits generated by his sales will allow him to reinvest in his business so that he can sell other wedding accessories, and will also enable him to meet his needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1153583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy wedding hats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Douala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":217,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serge Bertrand","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":38593},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":39823},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":41052},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":42282},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":43511},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":44739}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":38593,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":39610.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308072048,"comment":null},{"amount":75.66,"local_amount":39823,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40873.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315306446,"comment":null},{"amount":326.01,"local_amount":171584,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":176108.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T11:18:53Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:12:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454625,"name":"Saada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saada is a 52-year-old married woman with no children who spends her time tailoring to communicate with others.\r\n\r\nSaada is a hard-working woman, who is liked by almost all of her customers that come to her shop in order to enjoy communicating with her.\r\n\r\nSaada is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua, in order to buy  necessary tailoring tools and do necessary maintenance on her house.

Yolanda es micro empresaria y hace todo lo que puede para aumentar sus ingresos. Vende ropa y zapatos de segunda mano, vende frituras en las noches (negocio muy popular en la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, ya que muchos en vez de hacer cena compran carne frita de res, cerdo o pollo acompa\u00f1ada de pl\u00e1tano macho verde frito) y adem\u00e1s vende jugos naturales.

It still has not been completed, but she is building a bathroom and plans to continue with a bedroom.  In the photo we can see a block wall and behind her, in place of a wall, she uses curtains to divide the space.\r\n\r\nYolanda is entrepreneurial and does whatever she needs to increase her income.  She sells second-hand clothing and shoes in the day, and she sells fried food in the evenings (this is a very popular business in the Dominican Republic since instead of buying a meal, many people buy fried beef, pork, or chicken accompanied with fried green plantains.)

She has often provided separate payment plans in which prior to taking the item with them, the clients pay little by little until they have completely paid for it. Jeimy usually makes her purchases in stores where they offer her discounts and products of good quality that are sold to her. Her goal is to expand her store and her primary dream is to have her own house. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting this loan with Kiva, her first financing made with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

He lives with his wife and together they have 2 children ages 9 and 8. He loves them all very much and they above all are the engine that motivates him to move forward every day and to be better every day despite problems that arise every day.  Just seeing his family helps him to forget everything and move on. His house is located in the city of Camana, a city that is characterized by a warm and welcoming climate.  Thus, agriculture is popular, especially the growing of rice, corn, and beans among other things.  The city is also known for one of its most typical and delicious dishes, which is the \"chupe de camarones\" or finger-licking shrimp.  When he has a bit of free time, Alfredo likes to spend it with his family.  Because of the family's low income, Alfredo could only study up to the fifth grade, but he would have liked very much to have a college degree.\r\n\r\nAlfredo works daily in his business as a carpenter, especially in the construction of prefabricated houses.  He works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to two clients per day, since he is a bit of a workaholic.  He thinks he does well in his business because he is very responsible and above all honest with customers, and for that reason they always recommend him.\r\n\r\nAlfredo is very grateful to Kiva lenders since thanks to the help they have given he will be able to make improvements to his home such as building walls, because his home is currently made of plywood and woven mats.  In this way he can continue improving his family's quality of life and working to fulfill his greatest dream: \"To give a good education for their children and to have a larger carpentry shop.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1150823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She lives in the town of Pisco, which has many tourist attractions such as the Ballestas Islands and the Paracas Candelabra. These attract many tourists all year round, since they are beautiful landscapes. This benefits sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing immensely. When Patricia has some free time she loves to practice sports; she likes especially to play volleyball with people from her neighbourhood. In good Peruvian fashion, she loves to eat traditional food, her favourite dish being the delicious 'Pepper Chicken'. Due to the low income of her parents, she was only able to study until the fifth year of secondary school, but she would really have liked to get a degree in business administration. Patricia works with all her might in her small business of selling men's, women's, and children's clothes. She works about 10 hours a day and sometimes tends to as many as 30 customers a day.

He has 7 children ranging in age from 15 to 26 years, and he dreams that they will become successful people. He has 15 years of experience in manufacturing furniture for dining rooms, bedrooms, and living rooms.  He has his own cabinetmaker's shop, located on the side of his house, which he started based on his uncle's teaching of the trade. The products in greatest demand are  entertainment centers, as well as bedroom and dining sets.  For that reason, although he can build all the lines, recently he has focused on these products.  In his business he handles all of the labor, purchasing and marketing: He purchases the wood, the polish, does the cut preparation and assembly, as well as the finishing and sales.  He completes his sales at small stores located in a commercial corridor in the center of town as well as through people referred to him via the market.  His daily work is intense.  He begins his work at 7:00 am and continues to 7:00 pm each day and strives to perfect his technique in order to help his family get ahead.  Currently he is applying for a loan from Kiva, the first financing that he is requesting from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  With the loan he will buy wood, paint, sand and plywood in volumes that can increase production and improve his sales volume, which is what makes the Kiva loan a successful investment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1150832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy wood, paint, sand and plywood in volumes that can increase production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44971},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46021},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":47094},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":48193},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49318},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50469},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":51646},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":52851},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":54084},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.99},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.55,"local_amount":35917,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":38325.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395563,"comment":null},{"amount":5.41,"local_amount":9023,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":9628.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775354,"comment":null},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":72533,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":77396.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387349,"comment":null},{"amount":57.28,"local_amount":95459,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101859.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130532,"comment":null},{"amount":41.91,"local_amount":69855,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74538.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519402,"comment":null},{"amount":130.33,"local_amount":217213,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":231777.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968408,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-29T13:21:20Z","paid_date":"2013-08-30T08:40:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454761,"name":"Julienne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julienne is 37 years old.

She is nineteen years old, and she contributes her earnings to help with household bills. Her home is located in the city of Ica, a city known for its very warm and friendly climate. As a result of the climate, there is lots of agriculture in the area. Specifically, cotton, grapes, and asparagus, among other crops, are cultivated here. We can also find tourist spots, such as the beautiful Laguna de Huacachina, which is located in the middle of impressive dunes where adventure sports such as sandboarding are popular. In her free time, Jessica likes to listen to music, and above all she enjoys eating one of her favorite delicious dishes, chicken and rice. Due to her limited economic resources, she only attended high school, but she would have liked to study law.\r\n\r\nJessica works with lots of enthusiasm as a sales promoter in a store in her city. Since she helps her family with her earnings, she works around eight hours a day and can help up to thirty customers in a day. She believes that her work is going well for her because she is very responsible and always helps her customers with lots of kindness.\r\n\r\nJessica is very grateful to the Kiva lenders since thanks to the help they have provided her she will be able to purchase a gas stove. Currently, her family has a kerosene stove, which, due to the flammable nature of the fuel, had a small accident a couple days ago. Thankfully, it did not get out of hand, and as a result, with this improvement she will be able to provide a better quality of life to her family, and more importantly, more safety.

Two years ago, he decided to generate his own income by setting up a hall for video games, directed to generating entertainment for the new generations. Today he has succeeded in solidifying a small customer base, where youths and children are his principal customers. Every day from 8:30 in the morning until 9:30 at night, he works at his business, which every day produces more satisfaction for him, since it generates income and he identifies in it an important potential for growth that he want to reach.

His present challenge is to obtain working capital to permit him to innovate and strengthen his customer base even more. This is exactly the reason why he has turned to a Kiva loan, which will be his first financing through Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and which he will use to buy an Xbox, a Play Station, and two channels of video games. With the investment of his Kiva loan, he will update his offerings and offer his customers opportunities to access modern games, which are the most fun for youths and children, while Randy continues to increase his income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1150684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to buy an Xbox, a Play Station, and two channels of video games.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Baranoa-Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-28T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-27T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Randy David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82685},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84615},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86589},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88609},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90677},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92793},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94958},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97174},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99441},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101761},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104136},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106562}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.2},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":96.23,"local_amount":167300,"processed_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":171145.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775348,"comment":null},{"amount":553.77,"local_amount":962700,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":984827.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071240,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-30T14:38:03Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454816,"name":"Charity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charity lives in the Nanyuki area of Central province, Kenya.

Jorge loves him very much despite the fact that he drives him crazy, but he is the best gift that god has given him. His home is located in Chincha, a city that is characterized by its warm and welcoming climate. It has beautiful beaches and is also the cradle of the big glories of Peruvian sport. Its people are very cheerful and well known for being gifted in making delicious food. In his spare time, Jorge likes to stroll in the city with his family, above all because it is a moment to come together and share. He also likes to take the opportunity to eat one of his favorite dishes such as the very tasty Pachamanca, a baked meat dish.\r\nDue to the lack of economic resources, he only studied through high school but he would very much like to study for a university degree. \r\nDay in and day out, Jorge runs a vulcanizing business and has been doing this for 4 years. He works about 9 hours a day and can serve 15 customers in a day. He believes that his business is doing well because he is very friendly and always does good work.

Mkhitar wants to develop agriculture and turn it into a big farm in the future. \r\n\r\nTo this aim, Mkhitar plans to increase the number of cattle by purchasing 2 cows and a calf. This will allow him to earn more income from the sales of meat and milk. Mkhitar dreams of starting his own family and sustaining them. With developed agriculture, he will make his dream come true and live with higher living standards.

In her free time, Fernanda likes to go out with her child along the cozy city streets and sometimes she cooks a very delicious \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" (traditional Peruvian pork stew with noodles) to share with her family.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her effort and because of her savings from past jobs, Fernanda could buy a mototaxi, which she rents to other drivers so that they can use it and so that she can get income. Additionally, Fernanda also works with her mother in her small fish sales business. Fernanda feels pleased to be fulfilling her work and she believes that it is going well because of her good customer service.\r\n\r\nFernanda is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and now thanks to the offered support, she can provide general maintenance on her mototaxi. In this way, Fernanda will be able to count on the fact that her vehicle will be in good condition in order to continue renting it, and with that she hopes to be able to increase her income. In the near future Fernanda would like to use that income to get a car and finish the construction of her home, in order to be able to assure the well-being and future of her little daughter. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1150836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to be able to provide general maintenance on her moto-taxi.

She is married and has three children between 1 and 9 years of age.\r\n\r\nDorothy has made a request of a loan of 41,600 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy and insure a dairy cow.

In his business, he makes brushes from 1 to 6 inches and distributes them in hardware stores and in little warehouses and hardware stores, which have become his principal customers. His productive process begins when he makes the handle, processes the bristles, ties, paints and markets them. He puts special emphasis on pre-sale efforts, so that he can adjust his production to the demand. He sells from Tuesday to Friday, and works 8 hours a day.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es atender r\u00e1pidamente a su clientela, pero su impresora es muy lenta para las expectativas del cliente; esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 una impresora, papeler\u00eda y tinta en mayor volumen. Con su credikiva espera ofrecer un servicio mas efectivo a su clientela actual  y ganar muchos mas clientes potenciales.  Francisco se esmera diariamente en su labor,  por eso su horario de trabajo es de 12 horas diarias y los domingos y festivos logra extenderlo, pero aun as\u00ed se siente satisfecho y con muchos sue\u00f1os de prosperidad personal familiar y empresarial y todo esto se logra con trabajo disciplinado.      ","en":"30-year-old Francisco owns an internet cafe located in his home in a southern suburb of the city, where he lives with his spouse and their two children aged 4, and 9 months old. He has five years of experience in his business. He is a computer technician and needed to develop a related activity that would generate income. He predicted that his knowledge would fare him very well, which is indeed what happened. \r\n\r\nHis business offers internet services, printing and phone calls. His biggest challenge is to respond quickly to his customers, but his printer is too slow to be able to meet customer expectations. This is the reason he applied for a credikiva, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will invest in the purchase of a printer, and greater volumes of paper and ink. Through the loan, he expects to offer a more effective service to his existing customers and also win many more potential customers. Francisco works hard every day, working 12 hours daily and also on Sundays and holidays, but he still feels satisfied and has many dreams of prosperity for his family and his business, which he accomplishes through his disciplined work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1151645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a printer, and greater volumes of paper and ink.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-29T13:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-28T13:30:06Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Francisco Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73159},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80310},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82184},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84102},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86064},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":94181}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":73159,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78484.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775359,"comment":null},{"amount":48.18,"local_amount":80310,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":86156.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387354,"comment":null},{"amount":49.31,"local_amount":82184,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994181,"comment":null},{"amount":158.61,"local_amount":264347,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":283591.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130537,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-31T06:52:16Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":455090,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is aged 31 and single and has been in farming for six successive years running his farm with two farmhands engaged on a casual basis.

Blanca's three children, who range in age from 17- to 22-years old, have helped her make the business a success.

For the past year, Madina has been working hard to manage her retail shop where she sells essential commodities such as dry beans, sugar, and maize flour. Her loan group is comprised of three hardworking women. \r\n\r\nMadina is requesting a 6,000,000 UGX loan from BRAC Uganda to expand her business and buy more essential commodities such as maize flour, dry beans, and sugar to sell. Her loan will help her generate greater profits that she will use to expand her business. In the future, Madina hopes to own a wholesale shop. \r\n\r\nMadina is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has improved Madina's future
