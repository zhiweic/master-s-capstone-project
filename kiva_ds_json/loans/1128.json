Her husband makes his living as a daily worker but his income is not sufficient to meet the needs of the family members. She faced many problems in her early married life. There were days when her children often slept without having any food. But now her contribution to the family income is playing a vital role in fulfilling the needs of the family members. To cope with the increasing demand during the summer season, she has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan. She is a member of two person group and plans to use the loan to purchase variety of clothes in different colors. She hopes to get an increase in her net income and wishes to spend part of profits on the improvement of her house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Farmer's Goup Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kyamabaare Farmers was formed to meet the needs of farmers within Kyamabare Village. They had been progressing but lacked farm inputs to enhance their productivity. When the Ugafode staff approached the area six years back, the members were excited because it would answer the cries of  the farmers. They gladly embraced the opportunity and have been acquiring and paying their loans up to today. Vangirista is particularly happy because she has been able to educate some of her children through selling tomatoes and bananas.

is a 45-year-old single mother with seven children, four of whom go to school. She lives in Nakatoogo village with her children. She is a trader who deals in clothes for ladies. She has been in the textile business since 1996. She works seven days a week and each day she works 14 hours. She sells her products to residents from Nakatoogo, Kiwangala, Bethelem and Kampungu. \r\n\r\nFlorence started this business in order to get money to pay school fees for her children and because she already had some experience in textiles. She has acquired this loan to buy more clothing.

Khaidav, 57 years old, lives with her wife and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

As time passes, the number of people who listen to his teachings increases. His son has a mental disorder and needs constant care from his mother. The ger they live in has deteriorated over the years and needs some serious repair. Because their ger is made of woods rather than felts, repairing and insulation is possible. He is requesting a loan of 3,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as planks, felts, fiberglass and foam. Using these materials, he can make wall insulation and roof repairs to his Mongolian traditional ger. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

The main reason for the loan is that her husband wants to expand his business. There are currently two workers in her husband\u2019s tailoring center, working for him. He wants to hire two more workers so that his production capacity could be increased. For that purpose he requires two more new sewing machines and this loan would be used to purchase new sewing machines.\r\n\r\nSaima is very hopeful that after getting this loan her husband\u2019s business will flourish.

is a 36-year-old Palestinian married woman, mother of four children.\r\n\r\nFive months ago, Camilia opened a small convenience store of her own, to help her husband in making their living and covering their expenses.\r\n\r\nCamilia showed good work and professionalism in her domain ever since she started.

He has been running a Genge Duka (neighborhood shop) selling fruits, vegetables and dry foods like sugar, beans, wheat flour, baking flour, salt, etc., in the same shop for six years now.  He works from 6 a.m. to midnight daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.\r\n\r\nThis will be his 4th loan from Tujijenge Tanzania.  He used the previous loans to open the side for dry food.

He is married an lives with his family. They are of low income. Sacarias works exclusively in agriculture and in his free time works as a laborer in different land parcels in his community to support his family. In the last harvest, he had problems with drought, causing poor production and product quality. That made his family income fail, as they support themselves with farm production. Each year they grow mainly onions, potatoes and beans. This year, Sacarias wants to start out on the right foot and have good production with his crops. That is why he is asking for the loan to buy organic and chemical fertilizer. This way, he can improve onion and potato production. Sacarias  works on small land parcels with his wife. He also has a clear idea that with this loan, he will improve his crops and also his family's quality of

He previously received a 30,000 PHP loan that he used to buy spare parts and accessories and for the maintenance of his Jeepney* unit. His earnings were a big help for the education of his children and in his personal, household, and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nCrisencio would like to apply for another 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and for the maintenance of his Jeepney unit and also to buy some equipment for his repair shop. His profits from his business will definitely help him to cover his family's daily needs and pay for his children's education. He looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in his heart. \r\n\r\nCrosencio hopes to have more jeepneys and dreams that his children will have a good life and education. He meets every week with his co-fellowship** members to share stories of his life and business and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which he studies. \r\n\r\n* Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines. They were originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy enough for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Filipino culture. \r\n\r\n** All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1286249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To pay for the spare parts and maintenance of his jeepney unit and also to buy some equipment for his repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-05-24T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-23T17:50:10Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Crisencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4114.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372895048,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8228.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381670087,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10285.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534616,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8228.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399784012,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-24T22:24:51Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:53:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":562227,"name":"Rosa Irma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa  de 35 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su compa\u00f1ero de vida y sus dos hijos en casa propia, tiene un negocio de venta de tortas desde hace 4 a\u00f1os tiene muy buena clientela pues vende su comida a un buen precio su negocio lo tiene ubicado cerca de su lugar de su residencia con las ganancias que obtiene ayuda en los gastos que hay su casa, rosa solicita un credito que le permita poder comprar todo lo necesario para elaborar sus tortas como: pan, tomates, cebollas, mayonesa, mortadelas, entre otros ingredientes y asi poder tener mejores ganancias y seguir ayudando en su casa con los gastos que se le puedan presentar.","en":"Rosa, 35, lives with her life partner and their two children in their own home.

Rampur town in the Kalahandi district of Odisha, India formed a group named Jay Sriram to take a loan from Mahashakti Foundation and expand their businesses. Tapaswini, the head strong lady, is one of them. The lady standing on the extreme left in the photo raising her hand is Tapaswini. She is 30 years old and lives with her husband and two-year-old daughter.\r\n \r\nTapaswini has been running a Tiffin stall for the last 10 years with the hand holding support of her husband. Initially, Tapaswni started this business with her small investment. Gradually she developed her Tiffin stall business with the loan support from Mahashakti Foundation. As of today, she has taken three loans from Mahashakti and successfully expanded her business. The sweet items from her stall are very popular in the locality. Tapaswini gets a monthly income of 7,000 INR from the business. Out of this income, she is barely able to manage her household expenses along with her business expenses. So she wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Mahashakti Foundation.  From the present loan of 36,000 INR, Tapaswini wants to purchase more stock of oil, dough, sugar, etc. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs as she has to replenish her stock frequently.

She had already used most of her savings and needed cash flow to begin her business. She visited, applied and was approved at Accion in Austin. With the loan, Robin purchased baskets, baking sheets, cookie dough, wine bottles, decorations for the baskets, and small boxes with detailed designs to hold the baked goods. She is also using the loan to develop her website, which will be going live in the next few weeks. Robin realizes that she would not have been able to accomplish all these tasks without the loan from Accion.  \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to hire an employee, continue advertising by word of

She works with cattle and sells milk.  She started this business in 1993, buying one dairy cow for 5,000 somoni.  This business is the main source of income for her family.  Thanks to her hard work, today she has one bull, one dairy cow, and her monthly income is 8,000 somoni.

The biogas will be used for cooking and lighting. Every month he spends around $25 to buy kerosene and charcoal for cooking and lighting. This is not only costly for him but also tiresome, as the market is six kilometers away from his home. With biogas, this money can be saved.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php2000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Ph10,000 loan.

is Rowena, 42, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Macario, a driver and is a mother to her children. She and her husband are managing their household while operating the business. They are working hand in hand to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRowena owns and oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, from which she receives a boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and pay for the maintenance of her jeepney unit. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRowena hopes to have additional jeepney for her growing business and dreams of having a good and peaceful life. She meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1357456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"To

She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan with her two children. She loves her family and claims they are her greatest strength for getting up each morning and working hard to generate an income. \r\n\r\nSince 2010, she has been working as a tailor. She provides stitching services in her community. Her eldest daughter also helps her in stitching up dresses. She has excellent stitching skills, and due to the money she generates, she has managed to provide a better quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to expand her business and to purchase one more sewing machine, as her number of customers is increasing day by day. However, because of having only one machine, she cannot easily cope with all the customers on time; that results in a loss of money and customers. \r\n\r\nTherefore, as a member of a two-person lending group, she is asking for a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to invest in the purchase of a sewing machine. This will allow her to fulfill the demands of customers more efficiently and to elevate her level of income. \r\n\r\nWith the profit amount, she will pay the educational expenses of her children. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan. \r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture, Shahida is raising her

After she was separated from her ex-husband she \nwent to live in her brother's house and there she set up a tea stall with a little help from WSDS.\n\nThe tea stall was her primary source of income ever since she started it, and she said that her business is a full time responsibility, because of which she is not able to take another job. And she said that she has to be content with the meager income from her stall. She wishes to expand her business by attracting more customers, and for that she needs to buy more stock like tea leaves, sugar, milk and some ingredients. She is hopeful that the loan from Kiva will help her expand her tea stall.\n\nShe dreams of having a house for her own and her sons after 5 years. And she is very pleased and happy with the help she received from WSDS. She also said that WSDS has changed her life and what is now today is all because of the initiative and steps taken by WSDS. Without their support and help her life would have been very miserable and she would be helpless. \n\nThe other group members are also doing their bit by setting up similar stall in and around the village and also by raising piglets and buying things from the wholesale market from the nearest town and selling them in the village.\n\nAll the group members are happy to learn that Kiva will be providing them the loan and they are all eagerly waiting for it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1354989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","use":"to expand her existing tea hotel by buying stock like, sugar, milk etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bishnupur","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-24T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-23T22:10:05Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hatlam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tinhoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-26T10:55:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":563419,"name":"Brigida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Brigida is taking a loan of $1,000 to improve her business.

is married with four children. He owns a Coca-Cola container, which deals in the wholesale of soft drinks to retailers and customers in his community. He has been in business for 13 years and has employed one person to help him in the day to day running of his business. His wife is also fully involved in the running of the business. When Shadrick is not at his red container, he can be found at his local church where he serves as a pastor. \r\n\r\nThis is Shadreck\u2019s second loan. In 2012, Zoona gave Shadrick $3000 zero-interest working capital to assist him in ordering stock for his container. The working capital helped him because he was able to increase the number of crates he had from 300 to about 700 crates. Shadrick says the increase in stock levels gave the business an instant boost. The boost was so evident that he won a contest from his suppliers that allowed his wife to go to the UK. Today, Shadrick is requesting a loan so that he can order more crates of soft drinks and grow his business. He is convinced that the money will have a huge impact on his business.\r\n\r\nThe growth in his business will help Shadrick pay for his children\u2019s tertiary education. He explains that three of his children are in school and his first-born completed high school and is supposed to go for further studies in the UK, but this has not happened yet due to a lack of resources.\r\n\r\nShadrick\u2019s dream is to open a big warehouse in Solwezi town, where he can stock a lot of drinks and become a super distributor.

They are facing financial problems due to low monthly income.\r\n\r\nRaqia has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. She wants to invest in her husband\u2019s business so that their income and savings will be increased. The main purpose of the loan is for her husband to buy new tools for repairing and tuning automobiles. His customer base would be increased if he had the latest equipment and tools. In the future, with the profit he expects the loan to create, he wants to expand his workshop by adding more space to it.\r\n\r\nRaqia is very hopeful that this loan could solve many problems for her family, and she is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan for their help.

is 39 years old. He lives in Pakistan with his wife, two sons and a daughter. He owns a food stall in the market, where he sells tasty and delicious kabab. His income is too low to cover their household expenses. \r\n\r\nPresently, he is in need of purchasing oil, eggs, pulses (lentils) and beef for preparing kabab.

from Zimbabwe! This is 41-year-old Keneth from Bulawayo. He is married with one child, who attends school. Keneth runs a retail business buying men's jeans, trousers, shoes, and jackets for resale. He also buys electrical gadgets for resale, like adaptors and cellphone accessories, and women's clothing too. The business has been in operation for 8 years. He says the main challenges faced are lack of working capital, and exorbitant duty charges when declaring goods at the border.

In order to support her family she raises cattle. She started her farm in 2003 by buying a cow and some sheep with 18,000 som. Due to her diligence Tumara now has four milk cows, ten sheep and two horses and makes 12,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. In order to further develop her business Tumara has turned to micro-finance bank \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS). She will use this loan to purchase another milk cow.
