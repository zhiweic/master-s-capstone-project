The members decided to give it this name because the owner of the house where they meet has a small garden with three jasmine plants.\r\n\r\nThis story is about Quintila, who is 54 years old and a widow for more than ten years.  She has six children, of whom only Aleida is a student; she is in the second year of high school.  All the others are already married.  She has worked selling meat, chorizo, and chicken for seven years.  She decided to get into this business because she wanted to find the way to get her child ahead and to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is going to invest the loan she received in buying more meat, chorizo, and chicken to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nQuintila is very happy because she says it is going very well for her with her business.  Her sales have increased a lot, as well as her customers and income, so much so that she is saving to guarantee her daughter's education.  In this way her daughter can have a good professional career.\r\n\r\nThe goal she says she has for her business is to continue investing in her business to make it grow quickly, because what she really wants is to build a small store to set up her butcher shop to have better sales and stock as well as more and better profits.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and the Kiva

He has 3 wonderful children: 2 sons, ages 19 and 16, and a daughter who is 17.  He loves his children very much and works hard every day in raising them to be decent and happy individuals.

The city is well known for its hot climate, its beautiful beaches, and above all, for the generosity of its people.\r\n\r\nPercy is a very hard worker, and through much effort and saving he managed to start his grocery business.  He sells groceries at a store that he set up in his home, though he also works at a bakery in the mornings, often starting work at 5 AM.  Percy says that it is always good to have the extra money.  He has had his grocery business for 3 years now.  During that time he has won the affection of his customers, which is why he thinks his business is going well.\r\n \r\nPercy is very grateful to Kiva lenders, since their support will allow him to make improvements to his business.  These include repairing his roof, which is made of bamboo and clay, as well as replacing his gate, which is old and rusty.  He also intends to replace his door, which has become totally worm-eaten, and to purchase scaffolding.  These improvements will ensure that Percy has better security for his business and can provide his customers with more comfort when they visit his shop.  The improvements will also allow Percy to keep working and to achieve his biggest dream: for his children to find good professions and, most importantly, for them to be happy.

Her life and her family\u2019s life will also change.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and the activities they carry out are as follows: \r\n\r\nBlanca-clothing store\r\nFrancisca-milk sales\r\nClaudia-sewing workshop\r\nJuana-laundry \r\nJonaz-grocery store\r\nMaribel-sale of items for the home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5875,"image":{"id":1062181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes and sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ometepec,Gro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-04-15T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-15T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":5875,"lender_count":186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":7403.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":8335.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8825.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9155.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9592.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10099.89},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10533.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":11053.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":579.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":652.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":691.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":717.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":751.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":791.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":865.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":579.97,"local_amount":7403.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7405.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317501,"comment":null},{"amount":652.95,"local_amount":8335.53,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418886,"comment":null},{"amount":691.3,"local_amount":8825.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-31T08:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8827.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568464,"comment":null},{"amount":1426.84,"local_amount":18215.04,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-24T08:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":18219.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301399792,"comment":null},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":533.1,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":533.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308407533,"comment":null},{"amount":791.15,"local_amount":10099.89,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":10102.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392087,"comment":null},{"amount":825.13,"local_amount":10533.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":10536.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323119956,"comment":null},{"amount":865.89,"local_amount":11053.88,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11056.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068023,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-15T18:11:41Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T11:05:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":413325,"name":"Pechie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pechie works hard to support her family.

Juana has sold cut-up chicken for over 6 years.\r\n\r\nJuana says that she decided on this activity while searching for a way to offer a better quality of life for her family and a good education for her children, and she wanted to enjoy more stability and economic solvency. The loan she requests will be used to buy more chickens at wholesale and continue her sales.\r\n\r\nJuana's goal is to provide a good education for her son, so he can continue to study and have a profession. Also, she wants to make her business grow much more, since she is thinking of starting construction on her own cut-up chicken shop and thus, have a much greater selection in a shop that will improve

One thing she needs is to buy products for her small grocery store, such as rice, sugar, oil, beans, soaps, pastas, shampoo, etc.  That's why she went to CEPRODEL to receive financing in order to stay in business and satisfy the demand and make more money and be able to keep helping her children go to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":1063173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, flour, different kinds of pasta, soaps, etc.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Telica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-04-16T04:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-16T04:00:54Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1074},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1170.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1191.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1241.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1266.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1306.26},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1355.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1437.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1476.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1522.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1569.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.99,"local_amount":1074,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-06T08:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277196306,"comment":null},{"amount":51.19,"local_amount":1170.22,"processed_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-27T07:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1190.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283098198,"comment":null},{"amount":52.14,"local_amount":1191.57,"processed_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-28T08:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1212.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286830823,"comment":null},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":1529.99,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294538704,"comment":null},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":1314.58,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-21T09:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1337.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301359660,"comment":null},{"amount":57.63,"local_amount":1317.26,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-16T09:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1339.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315354835,"comment":null},{"amount":63.61,"local_amount":1453.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-25T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1478.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322964554,"comment":null},{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":1449.53,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1474.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331950744,"comment":null},{"amount":240.57,"local_amount":5498.9,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5593.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339488751,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Mariam is 19 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in Kampala, a region in the eastern part of Uganda. For the past year, Mariam has been working hard to manage her mobile business, through which she sells clothes. \n\nTo help expand her business, Mariam has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Mariam to generate greater profits and increase the capital in her business. Mariam hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \n\nMariam is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Mariam's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

For the past two years, Hellen has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \n\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale, and will help Hellen to generate greater profits and pay for her own house rent. Hellen hopes that in the future she will be able to expand her business. \n\nHellen is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

For the past 2 years, Carol has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \n\nTo help expand her business, Carol has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale, and will help Carol to generate greater profits and pay her own school fees. Carol hopes that in the future she will be able to own a designing shop. \n\nCarol is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Carol's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

Ella se siente muy contenta,  porque es independiente y maneja su propio dinero. Su meta es ampliar su negocio y tener un almac\u00e9n bien surtido, con todo lo que su clientela necesite. Pero su mayor desaf\u00edo, es que su capital de trabajo es insuficiente para responder a la demanda y la competencia logra impactar m\u00e1s. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento  que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 conjuntos para damas, camisas, jeans, que son pedidos que han hecho sus clientes,  pues se acerca el d\u00eda de las madres y est\u00e1 dispuesta a quedarles bien, para que estos puedan hacer sus regalos a un ser maravilloso como lo es la madre o a quien ocupe ese roll.","en":"Eydys, who is 45 years old, lives in the city of Cartagena with her husband and three children between the ages of 10 and 16. Her business is being a saleswoman, an activity that began when a friend of hers gave her merchandise on consignment, and she could return what she didn't sell. That is how she built up her initial clientele, and with her savings she was able to get together some capital and start making her own orders. She feels very content because she is independent and manages her own money.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to increase her business and have a well stocked inventory with everything her clientele needs. But her biggest challenge is that her working capital is insufficient to meet demand and the competition achieves a greater impact. This is precisely the reason that she has turned to her credikiva, the first financing she has done with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy women's suits, shirts, and jeans. These are what her clients have asked for, since Mother's Day is coming up, and she is ready to satisfy them so that they can give their gifts to the marvelous being that is the mother, or to whoever occupies that role."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1061740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

He lives in a four bedroom apartment with his family in the Ndamukong neighborhood in Bamenda town, in the North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n    \r\nHe is a carpenter by profession but does other business activities like his poultry and piggery. He said he is doing this carpentry trade because it is a trade he learned and he has experience in it. He also trust his handwork, judging from the community\u2019s recommendations. \r\n\r\nAs to the livestock business, the market trends are a driving force to his engaging in it, since the demand for poultry and pork products is steadily witnessing a rise. With this loan he plans to buy more wood for his carpentry workshop, as well as piglets, fowl and pig feed. \r\n\r\nHe says, \"My carpentry business helps the community in that people will be able to live in decent homes, because my work is affordable. Regarding the livestock business, it is going to improve the nutritional intake of my community members, thus healthier lives. Its by-products are going to provide manure, which is better in its environmental impact than artificial fertilizers. With the profits from the loan, I will continue the improvement of my family's educational and healthcare needs.\r\n      \r\nGilbert prefers GHAPE because they offer loans at very low interest and with a convenient repayments duration. They also offer free trainings on business techniques and marketing skills as well as other life skills.  In fact, he says, a whole lot on human development skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450.01,"image":{"id":1067411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for wood, piglets, fowl and pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ndamukong, Bamenda, NW.

Juma hopes that in the future he will be able to expand his business. \r\n\r\nJuma is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Juma who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1067469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more essential commodities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mbale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.064444 34.179444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2012-04-16T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-16T16:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juma ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":176246},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":182612},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":189208},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":196042},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":203123},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":210459},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":218061},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":225937},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":234098},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":242553},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":251559}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.98},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":412009,"name":"Roxana De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roxana, quiere invertir m\u00e1s en el negocio, por eso se ha decidido por solicitar un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo e invertirlo en ropa nueva como camisas, pantalones, ropa para ni\u00f1os, pues quiere tener surtido el negocio y poder realizar mejores ventas.\nSu experiencia con el pr\u00e9stamo anterior fue buena, incrementando su inventario y las ventas, esto tambien le ha dado una mejor solvencia econ\u00f3mica con su familia. \n","en":"\r\nRoxana wants to invest more in her business so she\u2019s decided to request a new loan to buy new clothes like shirts, pants and children\u2019s clothes because she wants to have her business well-stocked to have better sales.

El trabajo en el campo es muy duro, su jornada es de un promedio de diez horas al d\u00eda.

She\u2019s been farming for the last 25 years, an activity that has made it possible for her to survive.  She grows cocoa beans, bananas and traditional regional products to then sell.  Field work is very hard; her work days average ten hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatilde wants to invest in clearing and maintaining her farm and to do so needs to hire staff that will help her and machinery to remove the bad weeds from the place.  Because of this she needs a loan that will allow this woman to continue working.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHer loan officer has concluded after conducting an evaluation that this woman has low risk of delay or default.  We hope that things turn out well for Matilde and that she will be able to have a refreshed farm with new crops.

After she completed high school, it was difficult to continue her studies so she began looking for employment in various enterprises.  When she couldn't find work, Yessica decided to start her own business in her native Puerto Colombia and, today, she wants to make the business grow. Yessica is the proprietor of an internet cafe which she began with 2 computers and gradually, with her work discipline, she now has 5, plus the necessary clientele. Each day her cafe grows a little more.\r\n\r\nYessica's main challenge is to put together sufficient working capital to provide the impulse required to fulfill her growth expectations. Her goal for the future is to have sufficient infrastructure so that her customers can be comfortable in their privacy and not feel the incessant Caribbean heat in her cafe, which can be achieved, little by little, with the acquisition of an air conditioner and individual cubicles.\r\n\r\nNow Yessica is applying for a 'credikiva' (Kiva loan), her 1st financing through the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. She needs this to put her dream into action, beginning by upgrading her computers and buying new components for her equipment. This will initiate Yessica's grand commercial proposition, allowing her to improve service quality in the future. We expect this investment to result in the expected success, as Yessica pursues growth step by step with much discipline.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1061462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","use":"to upgrade her computers and buy new components for the equipment in her internet cafe.

They live in the community of Pucara, which is in Colomi and located 45 kilometers from the city of Cochabamba.  He and his family are farmers who have received an elementary school education.  \r\n\r\nSr. Apolinar and his wife said that they had another child who died last year, which is why they have had many expenses.  For this reason, they requested a new loan to buy organic compost (poultry manure) and potato seedlings in order to take advantage of the low seasonal prices.  They also want to buy these supplies while their current crop has yet to be harvested.  \r\n\r\nCIDRE operates in this area by providing loans.  Sr. Apolinar has taken the opportunity to continue receiving benefits by utilizing a new loan for buying farming supplies.  He is now very pleased since he did not have an easy time accessing loans from other financial institutions that asked for too many requirements.  Most importantly, Sr. Apolinar says he continues to support his children's studies because he wants them to have a better future.

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1988 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Gulbubu's hard and persistent work, today her livestock headcount includes four dairy cows, two horses and twenty-five sheep, and yields about 10,000 som (KGS) in monthly profit from sales of milk and milk products.  In order to further develop her business, Gulbubu requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.
