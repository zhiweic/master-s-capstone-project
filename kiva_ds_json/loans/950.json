Chanthy is going to use her portion of the loan to buy fertilizer for her farmland and pay labor fees as she will hire people to help in transplanting rice seedlings.

She is 28 years old and married, with three children, one of whom is in school and the other two are under school age. \r\n\r\nShe has been farming rice on one hectare of farmland.  Her husband also complements the family\u2019s income by making palm juice and working for others for a fee.

He has 2 milk cows, 2 calves, 2 oxen and goats. Nargiza produces dairy products.  The family sells their agricultural production locally. Armazi works hard, but he still doesn\u2019t have enough income to make some savings and expand his agricultural business.\r\n\r\nArmazi requested a loan to fence the garden. He will purchase building materials. The fence will protect nuts from animals and Armazi will be able to harvest more production. This will increase the income of the family.

is from the Tskaltubo district of West Georgia. She is 46 years old and lives with her husband, son, and parents-in-law. Her parents-in-law have a retirement pension. The family\u2019s economic activities are two greenhouses where cucumbers and different kinds of greens are grown. Nana does all the relevant seasonal work to ensure a good harvest. In addition, she runs a small dairy farm and has 4 milk cows whose milk is used for cheese production. Her agricultural and dairy production is sold at the local open market.\r\n\r\nNana works hard to generate some savings and expand her agricultural business.

She is married to Miguel Angel and they have two children in elementary school.  She sells Mexican snacks, such as tacos dorados, enchiladas, pambazos, lunches, different flavored juices, soft drinks and cookies, through a co-op she runs at the school her children attends.  She says she has been in business for four years and enjoys the co-op activity because it allows her to be near her children.  She tells us that she arrives at school very early in the morning to prepare to lunch for the students and teachers who eat there.  Every day she goes to the wholesale market in the nearest town to buy fresh fruit and vegetables to make her delicious meals.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to expand her business and buy more sweets and refreshments to have a bit more variety.  She only works at the co-op in the morning because there is someone else there in the afternoon, but she wanted to be the person responsible for the business because it is hard work and people advised her to take it over because she is such a good cook.

She used her last Kiva loan to increase the quantity of merchandise in her kiosk by purchasing many souvenirs, gift sets, and some office supplies. At one time, Yevgeniya's business was in trouble after a new supermarket opened and began offering office supplies at low prices. At first, Yevgeniya's profits fell, but now her business is getting back to normal. Since her last Kiva loan, Yevgeniya's son has entered college, which means that the family's expenditures have gone up.\r\n\r\nThis time, Yevgeniya needs a sum of 4,000 hryvnia to purchase supplies for school and university students, such as stationery, notebooks, textbooks, etc. Such merchandise sells well in September and October, which is why Yevgeniya would like to replenish her supplies and satisfy her customers' seasonal demands. Furthermore, Yevgeniya and her family would like to eventually expand their entrepreneurial activity and engage in agriculture: in the autumn, they are hoping to build a greenhouse in order to grow tomatoes for sale."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1198442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"to stock up on merchandise for school and university students, namely office supplies, notebooks, textbooks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Kamenka-Dneprovskaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.485278 34.405833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-09-21T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-21T09:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yevgeniya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4059,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419698,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T12:12:06Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":474406,"name":"Yelena","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 12 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0430. \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0430, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0443. \n\n\u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 4 000 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443, \u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0444\u0442\u044b, \u044e\u0431\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435-\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0434. \n","en":"Yelena is a marketplace entrepreneur from Melitopol.

His most critical challenge is to save and rebuild his house. \r\n\r\nEdermiro will reinvest the profits in his business and continue to save for the construction of his own house. His dreams are to live comfortably and save with his partner. He became interested in and motivated to join Esperanza after he was encouraged by others in this group to be part of the program and start his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":1196377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"To buy beef, pork and chicken.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2012-09-21T13:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-21T13:00:01Z","loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edermiro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliasin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":164000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":11309.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12785.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12987.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":13192.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":13401.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":13613.07},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":13828.4},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":14047.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14269.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":14495.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":14725.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":14958.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":386.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.38},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":334.58},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":356.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":361.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.62},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":373.44},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.36},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":291.37,"local_amount":11309.89,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11363.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308387535,"comment":null},{"amount":663.96,"local_amount":25772.78,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:56:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25894.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315372079,"comment":null},{"amount":1035.82,"local_amount":40206.84,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":40396.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322981019,"comment":null},{"amount":2233.85,"local_amount":86710.49,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87120.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331964919,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-25T10:16:37Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:29:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473328,"name":"Me","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Me is 30 years old and married with 3 children.

than a decade ago, Christine and her father moved to Abilene, Texas, for work. Her dad, who loved antiques, taught her to always carry a magnet to decipher between brass and metal when shopping yard sales. As she recalls, \u201cWe could always buy good, used furniture, hats, pins and buckles.\u201d Christine would accompany her father at trade shows during her high school years. However, she never truly enjoyed any part of it. \u201cIt was horrible in high school, selling cowboy hats in the heat,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I found myself getting good buys at garage sales and found a booth at an indoor market.\u201d \r\n\r\nSeeing there was potential to make a profit, Christine decided to launch The Last Remains, a small, environmentally friendly business that refurbishes and sells antiques. \r\n \r\n\u201cEveryone throws something away, but we can take those throwaways and sell them.  For instance, at estate sales, I find old suitcases and then \u2018upscale\u2019 them as pet beds,\u201d she says.  Suitcases padded with baby blankets and with chair legs attached, are among her bestselling products. \u201cWe take another item like a burned-out light bulb, remove the filament, wash it out with water and salt, then create hanging flower baskets.\"\r\n\r\nChristine said she spends hours cleaning her finds and sells the new creations at an affordable price. Currently, she employs her boyfriend, who also works remodeling homes. When on the job, he obtains reusable items for crafts. For example, he brought a window frame that Christine used as a photo frame, and a screen door, which she spray-painted and uses to display earrings and accessories at shows. Christine gives new life to old items that others would have trashed.  Doing this helps cut down on discarded items that end up in landfills.\r\n\r\nChristine and her boyfriend are looking to hire a welder to make animal-shaped objects from old tools and other objects such as a wine racks made from horse shoes and wood. In the future, they plan to hire more employees to assist with working multiple flea markets on the weekends, but Christine\u2019s major plan is to open a store within the next five years. \r\n\r\nShe discovered Accion Texas Inc., where she applied and was approved for this loan, through the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) in Abilene. Christine says the loan will go a long way toward purchasing furniture, wood and new materials to immediately begin creating items. \r\n\r\nShe showcases many photos on her Facebook page at: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thelastremains and her website at http:\/\/thelastremains.webs.com. Her father passed away December 2011, but the encouragement and support Christine receives from customers keeps her motivated to continue her father\u2019s trade.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1195826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase furniture, wood and new materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"El Paso, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2012-09-21T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-21T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":636,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":99.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":105.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":107.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":108.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.22,"local_amount":99.04,"processed_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":101.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308337515,"comment":null},{"amount":106.84,"local_amount":104.54,"processed_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315305863,"comment":null},{"amount":108.14,"local_amount":105.81,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914547,"comment":null},{"amount":109.85,"local_amount":107.48,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T09:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":109.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331745373,"comment":null},{"amount":111.26,"local_amount":108.87,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T11:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":111.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340153432,"comment":null},{"amount":112.69,"local_amount":110.26,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":112.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346988994,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-21T16:35:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":473247,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 42-year-old Mohamed from Waterloo eastern area in Freetown.

Rithy is a fourth-time borrower, while her fellow group members are a third-time borrower and a first-time borrower with VisionFund. The past loans enabled her to meet the family\u2019s needs and succeded in supporting her children\u2019s schooling. \r\n\r\nWith this new portion of loan, Rithy will use as working capital to buy fruits for resale to gain more income.

She is married and has three dependent children, two daughters and one son. Two of her children are in school and the other one is too young to attend school. Saron and her husband make their living through rice farming and pig raising. To supplement her income, Saron also runs a small grocery store.

Her husband is employed and gets a low salary, which is not enough to cover the family's needs.\r\n\r\nNoor is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of painting her house and installing new tiles in order to improve the living conditions in the family's house. Taking this loan will offer Noor and her family suitable home conditions, so the family can enjoy living in their house.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

most of his contemporaries were concentrating on college graduation or finding a job, 22-year-old Gavin, along with his partner Jeremy, decided to open a men's vintage clothing shop. Hello Boys, located in Nashville, is a \"sister\" store to Goodbuy Girls, which is owned and operated by close friends of Gavin and Jeremy. \r\n\r\nA determined and self-motivated person, Gavin had the idea to open a consignment shop, found an available place, purchased inventory, redecorated what used to be an office, established a website and opened his store , all within two months. He designed the boutiquestyle store to have shadow boxes that showcase merchandise and allow customers to see the fashionable and complete outfits.\r\n \r\nAfter acquiring a loan from Accion in the Delta, Gavin paid for shelving, the store's first month's rent and deposit and other supplies. He credits the loan for allowing the doors of Hello Boys to open on August 10. After his first weekend of business, they had to temporarily close the shop because they sold out of the majority of their inventory and needed time to replenish.  But doors are open again!  (And word is spreading rapidly about the exciting new venture. Gavin reports that legendary musician Elvis Costello and his family recently paid a visit to the shop.)\r\n\r\nHello Boys also helps sustain jobs. Gavin hired a local artist to help design the store's layout, make the color choices and paint the space. He also contributes to the success of others by selling shirts created by local entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nFor more info about the company, visit www.facebook.com\/helloboysnashville.

is Raquel, 34 years old and a resident of Taguig, Philippines. She is a mother to her child. By the grace of God, Pelagia has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to sustain their expenses.\n\nRaquel has a modular design business.  It is an approach that subdivides a system &#40;for example, a room in the office&#41; into smaller parts (modules) that can be independently created and then used in different systems to drive multiple business uses.  She earns a minimum of PHP 50,000 monthly.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy wood, hinges and other materials needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nRaquel dreams of expanding her business soon, just as she wants her child to graduate from college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of their work every week.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

With this goal in mind, she completed the \"Achieve Success\" course, organized by the Associated of Business Women, and obtained a certificate.  Now, she can start her own business and be successful at it.  She wants to organize a business of sewing women's clothing because she has experience in this type of business.  She plans to use the resulting income to provider her children with a good education and high-calorie food products.

amiga que comercializaba perfumes, cremas y cosm\u00e9ticos se fue del sector y qued\u00f3 este segmento  de mercado sin ser atendido; ella muy consciente de la oportunidad  intervino dando respuestas a peque\u00f1os pedidos de colonias y perfumer\u00eda. Poco a poco fue comprando vitrinas y exhibidores hasta convertirla en la miscel\u00e1nea de art\u00edculos que hoy ofrece y agreg\u00f3 lavadoras para ofrecer este servicio tan necesitado por las amas de casa de su sector. . Sus ventas las hace a cr\u00e9dito de lunes a domingos desde las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 9 de la noches, con un descanso intermedio; ella compra principalmente a distribuidores de productos en multicadenas y mediante gu\u00edas especializadas de productos o art\u00edculos o cat\u00e1logos, con los que lanza su oferta. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es comprar exhibidores y tener cada vez m\u00e1s un mayor surtido, que logre atraer y posicionarla cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s. En la actualidad se ha acercado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para solicitar un credikiva con le cual comprar perfumer\u00eda, cosm\u00e9ticos y ropa por encargo as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n dos lavadoras mas; pues este un negocio que genera otros ingresos y en el que quiere prosperar    tambi\u00e9n.  \n\n\n\n","en":"Julia, 59, is married and is the mother of 4 children.  Ten years ago she started up her own business venture, because her friend who used to sell perfumes, creams and cosmetics left this area and so an area of the market was not being attended to.  Aware of an opportunity she stepped in, taking small orders for cologne and perfumes.  She started to gradually buy glass display cases until she converted her business into a general store where she sells a variety of miscellaneous items.  She added washing machines in order to offer this service to the housewives in the neighborhood.  She makes her sales on credit every day from 8am until 9 at night, taking a period of rest in between.  She makes her purchases mainly from wholesalers who sell products from multiple chains, and through specialized catalogs offering products or goods for sale.  This is how she obtains her products to sell.\r\n\r\nJulia's goal for the future is to buy more display cases and gradually expand her inventory of goods.  This will allow her to attract more customers and better position herself in the marketplace over time.  She has now approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in order to request a Kiva loan to buy perfumes, cosmetics and clothing through orders, as well as two additional washing machines.  This way she can generate other sources of income and see her business prosper.

The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n\r\nMaria Luisa hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to have a simple yet happy family.
