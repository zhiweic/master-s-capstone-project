After fattening the animals, he resells them for a profitable price in the livestock bazaar.  Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.  \r\n\r\nHis business requires a lot of physical strength, as Araz spends most of his time in the open air. His wife helps him to feed the animals. \r\n\r\nHis monthly income is 140 AZN and Araz wishes to increase it. As meat is in high demand, he needs more capital to put into his business and cover the market.  For this purpose, he applied for 1,000 AZN. He will use the loan to buy two cattle and fodder.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":1099969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

is Khoy\u2019s fourth cycle loan with HKL. The purpose of this loan is to pay for the preparation of her child's wedding party, which will arrive soon. Khoy is a noble woman who always takes care of the family and educates her children to be good people living in the society. At present, Khoy is 62 years old and a mother of four children. She has become a single mother since her husband passed away in the last few years. Although she is getting older now, she still tries all of her effort to earn income. She normally goes though her commune to purchase and collect recycled materials and sells them to a local industry for profit. With the loan she has requested, Khoy hopes that it will help her to manage the wedding party well. She is very thankful to all of you who continually support her family since the

She is a dealer of beauty products. She looks for potential dealers where if she succeeds to recruit these potential dealers, she would have a commission for it. Another way is that she sells the beauty products which she gets from the distributor at a much cheaper price. She wishes to help her grandchildren in their financial needs for schooling.\r\n\r\nIn order to help her continue her work, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing this loan to buy more products from the distributor. She earns around 1,500 PHP weekly out of recruitment and selling products.\r\n\r\nConchita dreams to someday have enough money to renovate their house and then have land investments. She also dreams that she will have her own established outlet for her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

is a 51 year-old farmer from Vani District, West Georgia. He lives with his wife, Maya, three daughters (14, 5 and 1 year old) and parents (pensioners). Maya is an English language teacher and she has students. Paata runs the agricultural business of the family. In particular, he is busy with a family-owned plot of land. Paata grows melons, maize and nuts. He sells 8 tons of melons, 4 tons of maize and 450 kg of nuts on average per year. Paata sells the harvested products locally to greengrocery retailers. Total average monthly income of the family is 900 Laris.\r\n\r\nPaata requested a loan for purchasing fertilizers and for renting a tractor to till the land.

She lives in the Soledad municipality, which is where she sells cold drinks. She also sells merchandise on credit and by order. \r\n\r\nShe started her business in 2002, when she found her niche in the market so that she could generate income.  She discovered that the businesses close to her home did not have beer on the week-ends because the distributers only came two times a week.  She decided to have what these businesses needed.\r\n\r\nShe initially started with two baskets of beer in order to test the market.  As she was very well-received, she was interested in investing in this business.  Now, it is one of the most important income generators that she has.  She couples this with her retail distribution of merchandise, an alternative income through which she takes advantage of her captive clientele.\r\n\r\nShe currently does not have enough working capital to respond to her growing clientele.  That is exactly the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy cases of beer in order to increase her potential sales.  She will also be prepared with varied merchandise in order to respond to the seasons when there is the greatest commercial movement like family and religious holidays. She will buy clothes and lingerie to give her customers on credit, which is to be paid in a time period of no greater than 60 days.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to expand her business in order to get greater income.

Yasmith has a general store where she sells gifts for the home, costume jewelry, decorations, school supplies and jeans. She started her business on the suggestion of her husband who works for a company that produces sports clothing.  He suggested that she sell this merchandise in order to make additional income.  Yasmith has done very well in her business and she has regular customers who order items from her.  She also sells blouses and has an existing market for her products.  Her dream is to have her own commercial premises where she can display her merchandise and to become an important wholesaler, providing products to retailers.  \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this year, when the owner of some business premises offered to rent them to her at a good price because she was moving away from the city, Yasmith became interested in the offer and took advantage of it.  This is where her general store is now located and she would like to grow her business.  However, she does not have enough working capital.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan (the first loan she has taken out from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  She will use the loan to buy school supplies, decorations, gifts and clothing.  Her investment will be successful because her business is located in a commercial area that is very busy with passersby.  She will also make the most of the demand for merchandise which she generally experiences in May and June, as a result of the family and religious celebrations that take place during those months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1094676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy school supplies, decorations, gifts and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-22T00:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-21T00:00:09Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasmith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58321},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79655},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81514},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83416},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85362},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87354},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89392},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91478},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":93612},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95797},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98032},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":126067}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":128.21,"local_amount":219490,"processed_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":225900.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775158,"comment":null},{"amount":496.79,"local_amount":850510,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":875349.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-20T04:33:22Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:26:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428734,"name":"Evageline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evageline is a single woman.

Sus tradiciones culturales provienen del Valle del Cauca, lugar de donde es oriundo y  de all\u00ed lleg\u00f3 a la ciudad de Barranquilla hace 15 a\u00f1os. Alirio termin\u00f3 su bachillerato y empez\u00f3 a estudiar aviaci\u00f3n, pero solo lo hizo durante 1 a\u00f1o, porque los ingresos familiares no se lo permitieron, por eso se dedic\u00f3 gran parte de su vida a la crianza de peque\u00f1as especies y al cultivo de la tierra. En Barranquilla actualmente, ha logrado posicionarse en el comercio y distribuci\u00f3n de productos alimenticios de panader\u00eda y dulcer\u00eda y en su propia motocicleta reparte de tienda en tienda, todos los d\u00edas, galletas, brazos de reina y productos derivados de la harina de trigo, mientras los fines de semana se dedica a la venta de cerdo y gallina criolla a la que \u00faltimamente ha agregado pescado.

","en":"Alirio is 54 years old and lives in the southwestern portion of the city, where he performs many productive activities. On one hand, he distributes bakery products, sells hens and pigs, and he also sells candy. His cultural traditions are those of the Cauca Valley where he comes from. And from there, he arrived in the city of Barranquilla 15 years ago. Alirio graduated from secondary school and began studying aviation, but only for 1 year, since his family's income would not permit more. For that reason, he has dedicated the greater part of his life to raising small farm animals and cultivating the earth.\r\n\r\nIn Barranquilla at present, he has succeeded in establishing himself in commerce and food distribution, including baked goods and candy. He distributes these, store to store, on his own motorcycle everyday -- cookies, Swiss rolls, and other products derived from wheat flour -- while on weekends, he sells pigs and 'criolla' hens, and has lately added fish.\r\n\r\nAlirio's distant goal is to have a fish-raising enterprise and then, to acquire his own house. Meanwhile, his dreams are fulfilled through his own work. He has obtained a rotation of customer accounts each 9 days, an inventory rotation of 2 days, and a profitability over sales of no less than 30%, indicators that promise a successful investment of his Kiva loan, his first financing with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. \r\n\r\nAlirio will buy bakery and candy products for his expanding market, where demand is growing daily. His working capital is insufficient to restock his business and this is precisely what his Kiva loan will do.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1094699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy bakery and candy products for his growing market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-05-22T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-06-21T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alirio De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":53966},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55225},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":56514},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":57832},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":59182},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":60563},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":61976},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":63422},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":64902},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66418}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.48,"local_amount":53966,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:17Z","rounded_local_amount":55468.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101193,"comment":null},{"amount":32.21,"local_amount":55225,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":56762.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338805,"comment":null},{"amount":32.97,"local_amount":56514,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":58086.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395359,"comment":null},{"amount":33.74,"local_amount":57832,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":59441.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775159,"comment":null},{"amount":34.52,"local_amount":59182,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":60829.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387147,"comment":null},{"amount":35.33,"local_amount":60563,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":62248.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993996,"comment":null},{"amount":36.15,"local_amount":61976,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":63701,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130360,"comment":null},{"amount":113.6,"local_amount":194742,"processed_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200162.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519239,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-06-16T05:18:48Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":428802,"name":"Liduena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liduena is a farmer from Trinidad, Bohol.

She began her business to empower her to care for her child. Working seven days a week and ten hours a day, she earns about 1,900,000 SLL every month. \r\n\r\nFatmata would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan to buy materials like poplin, siphon, and cheek. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata plans to increase the level of her stock. She also plans to embark on international trade and to build a house. The rising cost of her supplies is one challenge she faces.

is 43-year-old Jestina.

She went through training at the Nixiou Hospital in Segbwema. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 2,240,000 SLL every month. \r\n\r\nJestina would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy more pharmaceuticals. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 350,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Jestina plans to own a modern pharmacy and to establish a branch in Pujehun, her home town. She also hopes that the loan will increase her stock and capital. One challenge she faces is the proliferation of fake drugs.

He worked for many years as an engineer in a company that was focused on the manufacturing of plastic goods. With this great experience and an understanding for the diversity of products that can be made from plastic and what goes into manufacturing them, Ricardo decide to start a business in this field. He decided to start a wholesale business that purchased and sold machines that were used for specialized plastic manufacturing. He saw no limits to his company and began selling domestically in the United States and internationally. He mainly sells to large companies and focuses most of his marketing to this kind of buyer.

She also looks after her parcels of land where she grows vegetables such as spinach, peas, lettuce, carrots, and other crops.  Soledad is a woman who is known for her charisma and cheerfulness, which are qualities that help her to hold on to customers.  In addition to her crops, she also sells firewood.  \"I have worked alone for many years since everything I do is for my son so that he lacks nothing and can finish his university studies,\" she says proudly.  One of her goals is to see her son develop as a person.  Later on she would like to strengthen her firewood business so that she can live peacefully.

Esta familia vive en su casa propia ubicada en una comunidad nativa en Chanchamayo.\n\nElla se dedica a la agricultura desde que era ni\u00f1a. Cuenta con dos parcelas de terreno donde siembra pl\u00e1tanos de tres variedades: isla, bellaco y largo.  As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, produce cacao en media parcela, \u201cCacao siembro hace a\u00f1os y s\u00ed me conviene porque cada kilo est\u00e1 ahora a 6 soles con 50 c\u00e9ntimos, pero hay meses en que llega a costar 11 soles\u201d, menciona. A pesar de la baja de precios, considera que \u00e9ste fruto es el que m\u00e1s satisfacciones le da. Su cosecha es una vez al a\u00f1o, mientras tanto se solventa con la venta de pl\u00e1tanos que recoge cada 20 d\u00edas.\nEl principal problema que encontr\u00f3 en todos estos a\u00f1os que lleva como mujer del campo es la falta de capital, por eso agradece el apoyo brindado.

Four of the children live with them and they are 15, 13, 10 and 8 years old. They live in the own home located in the native community of Chanchamayo.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in agriculture since she was a young girl. She has two parcels of land where she grows three varieties of bananas: Isla, Bellaco and lLargo. She also cultivates cacao on half a parcel. Susana says \"I have been growing cacao for years and it benefits me because each kilogram is being sold now for 6.50 soles but there are months that it increases to 11 soles\". Even though prices are lower, she considers this fruit to be the one that gives her the most satisfaction. Her harvest occurs once a year and meanwhile she makes money harvesting bananas every twenty days. \r\n\r\nThe main problem that she found in all these years, being a woman from the countryside, is the lack of capital. She is grateful for the support from MFP. Thanks to the coordinated efforts of her husband and herself, they can cover the basic necessities of their children. Susana is not a conformist and therefore wants to increase her cacao harvest and continue with agriculture because she has a good command of it and it gives her pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth credit with MFP. She is committed to making her payments on time, as she has done in the past. She belongs to the communal bank \"Los Pomporitos de San Crist\u00f3bal\" and she feels comfortable working with these responsible people. With the loan, she will be able to buy banana plants and plant them in the empty spaces of her parcels.

There she has a general store where she sells various products that the neighborhood families need for their homes.  She also engages in the traditional trade of making clothes of all types.  Her business started when she was a teenager upon finishing her high school studies.  She enrolled with the National Learning Service (SENA), a technical education institution that is supported by the national government.  Elsida studied sewing and interned at various family-owned workshops.  From that point, she began promoting her products at a local market and started to gain many customers.  As a result of having all of these customers, she was able to earn income to support her family.  She continued on to successfully build her own workshop, which she still operates to this day.  Elsida also takes advantage of her usual customers by providing them additional services, such as extending credit to people who she trusts.  She gradually organized her general store to the point that she is able to sell a little bit of everything.  Her sewing business enables her to participate in trade events such as fairs, traveling craft exhibits, and other promotions.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe growth of Elsida's business is expected to continue, so she is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy an industrial upright sewing machine so that she can continue improving her technique, make productive use of her time, and become more effective in her work each day.  At the same time, she will invest in fabrics in bulk so that she can obtain better prices.  Her goal is to upgrade her equipment since it is very old and has restricted her on several occasions.  Her greatest challenge is dealing with competitors who offer better prices, so she must respond by offering quality service in order to survive in the marketplace.

","en":"Malika is a young woman and the mother of three children.  Her oldest daughter and son are married, so she and her husband, Nozim, only have their youngest daughter in their care.\r\n\r\nMalika has been sewing women's clothes for a long time; she sews beautiful dresses for Tajik women. She used to work from home but now, because of an influx of customers, she rents a shop in a busy location in the center of town.

He is the father of a nineteen year old daughter and he lives in the southern part of the city, where he has own drink store. The store is part of a family tradition. His parents had a store where they sold basic retail goods and cold drinks. Later, his brother took over the business, which he eventually sold. This is how William took advantage of this strategic spot to start his own drink store. It is located in a high-traffic pedestrian area, which provides his business with a chance to grow. A year ago, William took out his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Mario Santo Domingo Foundation], which he used to make improvements to his business by cleaning up damp areas so that today he has a more comfortable environment for his customers. Among his next goals is fortifying his marketing strategy by opening a new sales point. He wants to take advantage of his experience to generate more sales and continue growing his business. Currently, he is requesting this Kiva loan, which will be his second loan with the Foundation, to purchase cases of beer, alcohol, and snacks so that he can prepare for one of his busiest times of the year, the month of May. May brings family and religious celebrations, which place a demand on his products. These demands, together with his experience, will make this investment very successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1092806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase cases of beer, alcohol, and snacks.
