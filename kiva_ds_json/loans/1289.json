Fausia has been married for the past ten years but has never thought of looking for employment because she has to be home all the time preparing food for her family.\n\nHer main fuel for cooking is charcoal, and with charcoal she has to be at attention until all the meals are ready.

Domnicus has been learning better farming methods within his group and wants to use hybrid seeds and fertilizers on his farm to grow maize, sorghum and millet during the 2014 long rains seasons. He is, however, constrained financially and is hoping to receive a loan from Kiva that will enable him to purchase these farm inputs. Domnicus believes that the use of hybrid seeds and fertilizer will increase his yields, and he will not only get enough food for his family but will also sell the surplus and obtain money to pay for his children\u2019s school fees.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer to grow maize, sorghum and millet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria west","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":336,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T17:50:10Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domnicus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":24150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":24150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-21T13:28:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642956,"name":"Alfred's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfred is a member of the Exodus Group in Chwele District.

As an active member in his community, Alfred also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers. Alfred plans on using future profits from the harvest to repair his home and buy a cow. His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more profits from the harvest and is able to feed his family.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya. The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. Alfred and the Exodus Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

For more than 5 years she has worked alongside her husband growing basic grains like corn and beans, and vegetables. Her parents are the ones who taught her how to work the land at a very young age because it is her family's vocation. She has an incomplete primary education. She completed up to the third year in school until her parents could no longer support her economically.

A challenges she faces, along with the majority of farmers with scarce resources, is the high prices of the supplies that they use to support their crops and the hauling of these same items to the area where their homes are. Consequently, today she is seeking financing to purchase supplies that will help protect her crops from bugs like the whitefly and the water worms that destroy and gnaw on the grains. \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to repair certain areas of her home, like the kitchen where she prepares their sacred food, which has deteriorated.

He would like to use the Kiva loan to buy fertilizers during maize production; he needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase their production. With profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He is pictured here in a group of 4 One Acre Fund farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 40 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Phillison has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving inputs for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nPhillison is married and has 5 children.  He is 46 years old and is known as a friendly and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group and burial committee.  Phillison has been a farmer for 20 years.  Phillison described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nPhillison first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Phillison joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and earn enough to feed family.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, wants to help more farmers and also spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Phillison plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Phillison\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest and was able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nPhillison and the Inama Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phillison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":213960,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643545,"name":"Marys Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marys, es una se\u00f1ora que vive con su hija de 16 a\u00f1os de edad, es divorciada, no posee ayuda del extranjero, se dedica a vender ropa, es un oficio que aprendi\u00f3 de familia, tiene una experiencia de cuatro a\u00f1os en ese \u00e1mbito, lo hace de manera independiente, trabaja de 6:00 a.m. hasta las 5:30 p.m.\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el objetivo de surtir su inventario, comprar\u00e1 ropa, como blusas, faldas, pantalones, camisas, trajes para ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, espera que le ayude a tener clientes m\u00e1s satisfechos, brindar un buen servicio, aumentar sus ventas y mejorar su econom\u00eda para cancelar puntualmente sus cuotas.\nSue\u00f1o con adquirir una casa propia y dar a su hija estudios universitarios, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n una mejor vida familiar.\n","en":"Marys is a lady who lives with her 16 year old daughter.

Felix joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative.  Felix plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Felix\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training.  \t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFelix and the Bidii farmers Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Busia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.416667 34.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christopher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vitalis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Conrad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642971,"name":"Anar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anar is 26 years old, married, and has a child.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHaruni is married and has three children.  He is 39 years old and is known as hardworking. He is active in his community in groups such as the women's group, and prayer group. Haruni has been a farmer for 25 years. Haruni described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHaruni first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Haruni joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers.  Haruni plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Haruni\u2019s own life was improved because he was able to feed the family. \r\n\r\nHaruni and the Baraka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.

His wife is hardly managing to take care of their three little children so Heros is the only breadwinner of the family. During the winter season Heros also goes to a neighboring country and little by little supports his family financially. \r\n\r\nHeros took a loan from a local financial institution before but wasn't able to pay it back on time, because of the family's poor living conditions. Now, thanks to his tireless and devoted work, Heros is perfectly managing to cover his family's daily needs and successfully runs his farm.

Because she is an active community member and wants to help more farmers, Agness has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved her life because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, and was able to save money.  In the future, Agness hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Agness and the Mamboleo Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left side of the photo.\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase their harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clare","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":326289,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":642947,"name":"Eugene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eugene is 34 years old.

He is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund  farmers. The group is made up of a total of 82 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. David has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving the necessary inputs to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDavid is 34 years old and has been a farmer for 15 years. David works as a farmer to provide for his three children. The community and other farmers know David as friendly, hardworking and reliable. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community such as the men's group and the savings group.  David described his harvest last year as not with One Acre Fund, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDavid is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. David joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and is an active community member and wants to help more farmers. David plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nDavid and the Amuka Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet and sorghum seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vincent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":438618,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":438618}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654646,"name":"Jotham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jotham is a 27-year-old from Nakuru.

is married with three children. In order to help support her spouse and meet the needs of her children, she started sewing at home. She did not have a hard time finding customers and soon opened a shop with a partner. However, she and her partner separated, and she opened her own shop. With a loan from Maya Fatma bought a sewing machine and for seven years ran the shop and did all of the sewing on her own. \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to her sewing Fatma sells Amway products. Because most of the Amway sales are order-based, cash is tight so she would like to get a loan. If she had the Amway products in bulk, she would be able to make more of a profit and be able to give her customers their goods when they come into the store instead of having to wait for delivery.\r\n<p>\r\nFatma is now applying for a 1,000 TRY loan through Maya to buy more Amway stock and sewing materials. Two of her children are getting married, and the youngest would like to finish university. Once these obligations with the children are over, Fatma would like to go on a pilgrimage.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nFatma Han\u0131m,evli ve 3 \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.  \u0130lk ba\u015flarda e\u015fine destek olmak,\u00e7ocuklar\u0131n\u0131n ihtiya\u00e7lar\u0131n\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131lamak i\u00e7in evde diki\u015f dikmeye ba\u015flam\u0131\u015f.

Rael has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.<br \/><br \/>Rael is married and has 5 children.  She is 46 years old and is known as being friendly and trustworthy.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group and prayer group.  Rael has been a farmer for 20 years.  Rael described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.<br \/><br \/>Rael first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Rael joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices get new farming methods.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member. She also wants to help more farmers and  spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Rael plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Rael\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training and was able to feed the family. <br \/><br \/>Rael and the Amukeni Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

So Fulada has decided to start tea cultivation in their plot of land.  The idea came to her as an alternative way to generate more income. She applied for a loan from BJS to buy tea seedlings and fertilizers to start cultivation of tea plants, and start a business of selling tea leaves in their locality.  Tea leaves are in good demand in the present market.\r\n\r\nWith perseverance, love and great dedication Fulada hopes she will be able to achieve her objectives and earn enough money to help her husband with the family's finances. Fulada's dream is to continue earning money with this business. In this way she will be able to continue to support her children. She would like to offer them the opportunity to go to higher studies, so that they have a more prosperous and successful future.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to BJS and Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1486488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy tea seedlings and fertilizers to start cultivation of tea plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Maynaguri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fulada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-08T22:02:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643012,"name":"Kunjabala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kunjabala is 41 years old and a housewife who is married to Sokin.

He lives in an adobe house with only his wife because their children are grown up and independent.  He earns his living in coffee production in the community of Santa F\u00e9 where he has 2 hectares of land he got from his parents and with prior earnings.  He has more than 35 years of experience and since starting out he has managed to pay for family expenses by selling organic coffee beans.  He does his daily work with steady help from his wife, and from hired workers when the work gets tough.

He appreciates the financial support he receives to get ahead.  He promises to make his payments on time.

He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWekesa is married and has ten children.  He is 60-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Wekesa has been a farmer for twenty years.

Wekesa joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, and he wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Wekesa plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send children to school, repair the home and save for the future.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Wekesa\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvest, able to save money and feed the family. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWekesa and the Best Home Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete-","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:10:07Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wekesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jumba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kivajiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":283497,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283497}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643058,"name":"Hala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hala is a 50-year-old Lebanese woman.

He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers. Protus plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Protus\u2019s own life was improved because he has more farm training and has more farm group support.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nProtus and the Lutaso Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1485425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seeds and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":171168,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-03T15:58:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643075,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema is married with two children and one child goes to school.

momento estaba indeciso ya que la llamada era para invitarlo a matricularse en cualquier programa t\u00e9cnico laboral, la mama de Nelson lo \u00e1nimo para que iniciara un programa de estos, por ello al verse respaldado por la familia decide  tomar la decisi\u00f3n de ir a campo alto en la sed de suba, para \u00e9l esta instituci\u00f3n no era tan desconocida como tal, ya que la hermana estudiaba en ella tambi\u00e9n, el en la actualidad se encuentra estudiando auxiliar contable, donde se encuentra muy animado por haber tomado esta decisi\u00f3n, no se ha arrepentido de pertenecer a esta instituci\u00f3n, le apasiona los n\u00fameros y se siente identificado al momento de hacer un ejercicio, un taller, ver una teor\u00eda, a experimentado otro mundo acad\u00e9mico con tan corta edad , le parece que este t\u00e9cnico le sirve como una base para ingresar m\u00e1s adelante en una universidad, ya que quer\u00eda seguir con la contabilidad pero ya profesional, para salir adelante, ser alguien y ayudarle a la familia, darle respaldo econ\u00f3micamente y en todo sentido a si como ellos lo han hecho con el, por ello el quiere seguir con las practicas, y requiere del subsidio de kiva como una ayuda, ya que en el momento no posee recursos suficientes para culminar su t\u00e9cnico laboral.\n\nGracias \n","en":"The young Nelson was in the ninth grade studying at school one day when at the end of the day two youths in uniform who appeared to be students or nurses arrived at his classroom. Evidently they were not students of the institution where young Nelson studied, however, they entered the classroom. The classroom was filled with boys, girls and young people with different personalities. As in all classrooms, there was no lack of groups of the sensible, the joking but intelligent, the quiet and those that wish to see the positive and humorous of every comment. \r\n\r\nThe youths that had entered the room introduced themselves as students of Campo Alto, which they described as an institution with technical programs that prepared people with the education they needed for work. They described the different programs and to some of the students of Nelson\u2019s school it seemed impossible, others did not even pay attention but there were few who were interested by it. To Nelson it seemed like something complicated but not impossible. He was interested in receiving information through a flyer and filled out a sheet where he wrote down and left some contact information. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing school that day, Nelson headed home and upon arriving to his house he told his mom about the information that the students of Campo Alto had shared with him. His mom liked the information and Nelson started to think it over in his head. He thought very positively about the idea and at the same time was excited as he already saw it as a true opportunity to get ahead. He was a little hesitant about the financial part, even though they had told him that they would give him a subsidy.\r\n\r\nThis all happened more or less in September. In December, Campo Alto called the cell phone that he had listed on the informational sheet. In this moment, Nelson was indecisive as the call was to invite him to enroll in any of the technical work programs. Nelson\u2019s mother encouraged him to start in one of these programs and due to the backing of his family he decided to go to Campo Alto with the drive to improve. For him, this institution was not too unknown as his sister studied there as well.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nelson is studying to be an accounting assistant. He is very happy that he made this decision and has not regretted joining the institution. He is passionate about numbers and he identifies with the exercises, the workshops and seeing a theory. He enjoys experimenting with a whole other world of academics at such a young age. Nelson believes this technical skill will serve him as a base to later enter a university. \r\n\r\nNelson already wants to continue with accounting but as a professional so that he can get ahead, be somebody and help his family, providing economic and all other types of support as they have done for him. For these reasons, he wants to continue with his studies and needs the help of a Kiva loan because right now he does not have sufficient resources to finish his technical work.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for a semester of enrollment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":624000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T12:08:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654778,"name":"Juan Baustista","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Juan Bautista de 42  a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposa,  tiene dos  hijos  que dependen de \u00e9l y vive en una comunidad de San Lorenzo, valle al sur de Honduras.\nDon Juan Bautista tiene casa propia  y se dedica desde hace 08 a\u00f1os a la venta de ropa de forma ambulante,  sus clientes le prefieren por su buen trato, ya que les ofrece en sus a sus clientes la ropa que necesitan.\nDon Juan Bautista tiene su negocio en su casa y tambi\u00e9n sale a vender en su motocicleta a las aldeas y barrios aleda\u00f1os a su comunidad, es un hombre emprendedor con deseos de sacar adelante a su familia. \nDon Juan Bautista est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para la  compra de bl\u00fameres, braseares, blusas, faldas, pantalones, camisas ya que tiene varios pedidos de ropa con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo espera suplir la necesidad de financiamiento, el es un buen cliente que desea  seguir trabajando con Prisma.\n Su sue\u00f1o es mejorar su negocio.\n\n San Lorenzo, Honduras - Diciembre del 2013.\n","en":"Juan Bautista is 42 years old and lives with his wife.

As the Kiva group representative, Willson is pictured on the right of the Jua Kali Group with his hand raised.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson is married and has 13 children.  He is 73 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Willson has been a farmer for 63 years.  He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2008 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Willson joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices,  get new farming methods, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and an active community member, who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nWillson plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair their home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Willson\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, is able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWillson and the Jua Kali Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":246054,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246054}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643076,"name":"Asmahan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asmahan is a 56-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and six children.

She began this business because she went up to the tertiary school level but because there were no jobs, she decided to go into business; she works at the business from 10:00 a.m. until 12:00 midnight, six days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is the price inflation of goods.\r\n\r\nBintu requires a loan in order to purchase more soft drinks, pure water, and mayonnaise. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to become more successful and pay for her children's school fees. In the future, Bintu plans to open a big pharmacy. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":56.14,"image":{"id":1486570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more soft drinks, pure water, and mayonnaise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":183,"posted_date":"2013-12-08T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":238168},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":246770},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":255683},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":264918},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":274487},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":284401},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":294673},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":305317},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":316344},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":327771},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":339609},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":351859}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.26},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.7},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.14,"local_amount":238168,"processed_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":243524.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439687041,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-18T02:21:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643081,"name":"Annonciathe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annonciathe is 43 years old.

With the additional money he will earn as a CKW, Jacob will buy more land to grow crops and rear livestock on a large scale. \r\n\r\nHis biggest dream in life is to become a large scale producer of livestock products and  to help other farmers to adopt good agricultural practices."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a mobile phone, a solar charging set and a weighing scale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":259,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T23:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T23:30:22Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":35,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T22:30:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":654734,"name":"Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loan, 35, is married and has two children.

Her biggest dream in life is to become a model farmer and help other farmers adopt good agricultural practices."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1507129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a mobile phone, a solar charging set and a weighing scale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masindi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":259,"posted_date":"2014-01-07T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-06T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":35,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2014-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":19696.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-08T02:38:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643025,"name":"Alfred Azoh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfred Azoh is married and has five children.

Having joined the group recently, he learned from the older group members that he could get an alternative source of fuel for his wife that was cleaner, cheaper and more convenient. He learned that his family could enjoy solar power for lighting and avoid buying kerosene. The economical cook stoves for firewood and charcoal would also enable her wife save 50% of the fuel consumption. Hence, the one-week load of firewood would last for two weeks, saving her energy and time. He has received the two items on credit and will be able to repay in 24 months from his farm proceeds.

Faris's wife is a homemaker.\r\n\r\nFresh fruits and vegetables are popular among Azeri people, who use them as ingredients in such dishes as jam, cakes, and pies. Fruits are also used to make fresh juices and stewed fruit dishes.

bamboo, nails, varnish and other materials. Her earnings were a big help for the education of her children, and in her personal, household and business expenditures. She also has a direct-selling business and sells frozen foods for additional income.\n\nShe would like to apply for another 14,000 PHP loan for her to buy more materials needed in furniture making, like bamboo, nails, varnish and other materials, products for her retail business such as soaps and processed foods. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children's education. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\n\nCarole Cristina dreams to be more successful in her business and hopes to have a happy family.

The group represent a total of 53 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Brenda is pictured on the right of the Ebeneza Group with her hand raised.\t\r\n\r\nBrenda is 37 years old and has been a farmer for seventeen years. Brenda works as a farmer to provide for her four children. The community and other farmers know Brenda as hardworking and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community, such as the women's group and burial committee. Brenda described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nBrenda first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Brenda joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nBrenda plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school and buy a cow. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Brenda\u2019s own life was improved because she has more farm training, has more farm group support and was able to feed the family.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBrenda and the Ebeneza Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. \r\n\r\nThroughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-09T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-07T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":283497,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283497}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T17:58:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":643135,"name":"Chernor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Chernor, a 43-year-old from Waterloo eastern area in Freetown.
