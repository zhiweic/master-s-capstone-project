is 36 years old. He lives with his wife and two children (2 and 4 years old) in Batumi city. In fact, the family doesn't have a source of income and they live in poverty. So, Jemal decided to move to his village and rent his house to get a monthly income. He requested a loan from local financial institutions for the business start-up without any success. His loan request was rejected because of his low income and lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages providing business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income.

They have been together for a considerable length of time, and their loving relationship has produced 4 children: Alfredo, Reyna, Edwin and Ruth. Their home was built using quality construction materials. \r\n\r\nShe is a tireless worker and puts a lot of effort and dedication into her work caring for and producing cacao. She has been doing this kind of work for 20 years on plots of land that she acquired in the days after their wedding. As many people know, working in the fields is both arduous and exhausting. For this reason, on more than one occasion it has been necessary to get additional support and help from local labourers. With their assistance unfinished tasks can be completed quickly. This can result in a higher quality harvest by the end of the season due to the attention given to the crop. She believes that this makes sense because when she sells her goods to the local middlemen she can make good earnings. This in turn helps stabilise her family\u2019s economic situation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the technical studies carried out by the institution expert in the field, she noticed that her plots of land did not offer the shade required in order for the cacao plants to develop strong pods. For this reason she must plant trees immediately that will give temporary shade and grow quickly, such as the banana tree. This is why she must take on extra staff, to support her and her husband with this task. She must also weed the plots, as the weeds compete with the crops for nutrients, and carry out other crop maintenance work. \r\n\r\nIn the future she plans to buy land in the city and to build a house there for her children.

Susana de 51 a\u00f1os, tienen 3 hijos ya adultos de 34, 32 y 21 a\u00f1os. Vive con su esposa en el sur de la ciudad de Quito capital de la Rep\u00fablica del Ecuador, espec\u00edficamente en el barrio de Chimbacalle un barrio muy emblem\u00e1tico de Quito principalmente por ser la morada de la \u00fanica Estaci\u00f3n de trenes de la capital la cual se convertir\u00e1 en un museo ferroviario que a la par con los museos de su alrededor se ha convertido en uno de los lugares tur\u00edsticos m\u00e1s visitados del pa\u00eds. Sumado a este atractivo, en general, el sector sur de la ciudad de Quito en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se ha desarrollado notablemente tanto urbana y econ\u00f3micamente, es as\u00ed que inversionistas han apostado para sembrar sus ideas en varios puntos clave de este sector. La competencia para microempresarios es muy fuerte, pues se puede encontrar negocios de todo tipo en cada paso.  Chimbacalle alberga grandes historias de hombres y mujeres luchadoras que han encontrado en este lugar alto de la ciudad, la oportunidad de ver sus sue\u00f1os cumplidos y adem\u00e1s de ser parte del crecimiento de este sector de la ciudad. \nJos\u00e9 se ha dedicado a comercializar verduras y frutas desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, cuando aprendi\u00f3 de un gran amigo de la Costa ecuatoriana a quien le ayudaba en esta actividad. No recibe ayuda de personas adicionales, solo en su local trabaja al menos 8 horas diarias. Muchas veces no puede abastecer los pedidos de sus clientes porque no cuenta con los productos solicitados. Sin embargo con su experiencia, \u00e9l afirma que sus ingresos mejorar\u00edan si invierte en surtir sus productos. Por esta raz\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 acudi\u00f3 a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito con el cual pueda hacer realidad esta idea. Jos\u00e9 espera que invirtiendo este dinero y poniendo en pr\u00e1ctica la asesor\u00eda que su ejecutivo le brinda con herramientas para la buena administraci\u00f3n de su negocio; \u00e9l pueda incrementar la utilidad de su negocio para tener un ahorro que en el futuro le permita adquirir un cami\u00f3n para distribuir al por mayor a otros sectores de la ciudad y de la provincia. Jos\u00e9 agradece la intermediaci\u00f3n de Kiva para que varias personas alrededor del mundo participen en el cumplimiento de sus sue\u00f1os. ","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 54-year-old man who studied secondary education but later became a merchant.  He is married to Susana who is 51 years old.  They have three adult children who are 34, 32 and 21 years old.  He lives with his wife in the south of the city of Quito, the capital of the Republic of Ecuador, specifically in the neighborhood of Chimbacalle, a very emblematic neighborhood of Quito.  This is mainly because it is the dwelling place of the only train station in the capital which will be converted into a railway museum that, on par with the surrounding museums, has become one of the most visited tourist places in the country.  Together with this attraction, in general, the southern sector of the city of Quito in recent years has developed considerably, both in an urban and economic sense.  So investors have positioned themselves to sow their plans in several key places in this sector.  The competition for small-businessmen is very strong, as one can find all kinds of businesses at every step.  Chimbacalle harbors great stories of fighting men and women who have found in this high place in the city the opportunity to see their dreams fulfilled and also to be part of the growth of this area of the city.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has made a living selling vegetables and fruits for 15 years from the time when he learned from a great friend from the Ecuadoran coast who was helping him in this activity.  He doesn\u2019t receive any help from additional people, he works alone in his business location at least 8 hours a day.  Many times he can\u2019t supply the orders of his customers because he doesn\u2019t have the requested products.  However, with his experience he states that his income would improve if he invests in stocking up on his products.  For this reason Jos\u00e9 turned to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa to request a loan with which he can make this idea a reality.  Jos\u00e9 hopes that by investing this money and putting into practice the advice that his manager provides him with the tools for good administration of his business, he can increase the utility of his business to have a savings that in the future will allow him to purchase a truck to distribute wholesale to other sectors of the city and of the province.  Jos\u00e9 is grateful for the intermediation of Kiva so that various people around the world participate in the fulfillment of his dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1244534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to

Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about SLL 8,493,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

is a very busy and motivated entrepreneur who has only worked in three jobs that weren\u2019t run by him.  He is always looking for new challenges.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my passion to do business,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to sell and connect with people. It\u2019s in my blood to do business.\u201d His venture, GM Jewelry Watches, is an eBay.com business that sells brand name, warranty backed watches, which he purchases in bulk directly from the manufacturer.  Originally from Pakistan, Muhammad currently resides in Houston.\r\n\r\nIn order not to get lost amid the huge number of watches sold on eBay, Muhammad says he takes about 16 photos and leaves a detailed description of each item.  This allows for a better and more thorough online customer experience.\r\n\r\nWhen he first moved to the United States, Muhammad tried selling cars and auto parts and working in the construction business, but didn\u2019t like any of these career paths because they can be slow to return profits.  Then one day he looked into selling watches online and realized he could create a very positive and profitable enterprise. \u201cI sell my watches within three to seven days,\u201d he says. He credits his success to past customers who refer their friends and family members.  He sells about 90 watches a month.\r\n\r\nGM Jewelry was launched in early 2012 and, as sales picked up in the first quarter, Muhammad found he needed a loan to purchase more inventory.  In his native country, he had established a good relationship with a bank that worked with small businesses.  With no such contacts in Houston, he started searching online and spoke with various lenders.  He was eventually referred to ACCION Texas Inc.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to Google to find ACCION\u2019s number, called it, and within three to four weeks, I was done,\u201d Muhammad says. \r\n\r\nHe plans to pay off this loan within six months and then apply for a larger one.

Geser's wife is a shop assistant at a local company, but a couple of months ago she had an operation on her stomach.  Geser is working as a watchman and working 24 hours.

In the winter, his house passes its heat through the door and gets colder, so they need to use a coal-burning stove to stay warm. The coal burning is becoming the primary source of air pollution in Mongolia, so Geser is requesting 3,000,000 MNT to build a small barn where the house door meets with the outside.

is Myrna, 40, a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Ernesto and is a mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide an income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMyrna operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others. Aside from this, she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHPs-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmma hopes to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She has raised 5 children, the youngest of whom is a student, while the rest are adults and earn their own living. Kenjebu's husband actively helps her around the house. Kenjebu has vocational post-secondary education. She is a very calm and positive woman, who always believes in the bright future for her family, but never forgets the harsh realities of life.\r\n\r\nAs the main source of income for her family, Kenjebu raises livestock and cultivates crops. Additionally, for many years she has been preparing and selling traditional non-alcoholic beverages. Her business, launched with an initial investment of 15,000 som (KGS) after the break-up of the USSR, presently earns roughly 15,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products. Currently, Kenjebu's farm includes 2 dairy cows, 1 mare, 15 sheep, 10 chickens, and one beautiful yurt.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Kenjebu has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 135,000 som (KGS) to purchase 3 dairy cows. The cows will produce additional milk, and so Kenjebu will be able to prepare a larger volume of traditional beverages."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1064.81,"image":{"id":1244903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

NEMA became interested in revenue-generating businesses from her aunt, who used to do commerce in a variety of goods. After years of experience with the latter, NEMA opted for buying and selling grains: peanuts, black-eyed peas, millet, fonio, corn, dah, etc. \r\n\r\nAfter having correctly repaid the previous loans, NEMA is on her fifth loan with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. It will be used to purchase 100 sacks of millet from peasant producers (in OUELESSEBOUGOU, KELEYA, and OUROUN) and rarely from local wholesalers. Accepting cash or credit, she makes her sales retail at her home, at the Ouelessebougou market, and at the surrounding fairs. Her customer base is composed essentially of consumers. \r\n\r\nNEMA hopes to make a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA will be used to help out her husband in meeting the needs of the family, repaying the loan, and reinvesting in business. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1245044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-11-27T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-27T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84220.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179939,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84220.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029793,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84220.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924004,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T21:32:30Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":501875,"name":"Gina Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"GINA KARINA tiene 20 a\u00f1os de estado civil Casada tiene un hijo, vive con el esposo y con los hijos  en la ciudad de Ventanas Provincia de los R\u00edos.\nLA V.R.C EL GUASMO, SE ENCUENTRA UBICADA EN EL RECINTO AGUA FRIA DE MOCACHE, PERTENE AL CANTON MOCAHCE SE DEDICAN A LABORES AGRICOLAS Y PECUARIOS.\nGINA KARINA se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz.

married with four children.  The three older children have families of their own.  Her eldest son works in livestock and helps her youngest son.  Her husband and younger son help out actively on the farm.  Thanks to her perseverance and diligence, the family has achieved a lot of success.  As the family's chief breadwinner, Hurihon earns her living growing crops and breeding livestock.  She started out forty years ago with 5,000KGS and today the farm brings in nearly 10,000KGS per month.  At present the farm has two bulls and five heads of sheep, and .91 hectares of land where the family grows potatoes and corn.  To further the business, Hurihon has turned to Bai-Tulum for a loan of 75,000KGS so she can buy three bulls to fatten up for sale in five or six months.  Her plans include building a fence around the house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1244968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like rice, pork, vegetables, chicken, fish and other ingredients. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nGloria hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of having an abundant life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a great woman, and mother to Deyvis who is one year old. When she was 21 years old she was able to become independent, so that she could provide her little one with the best possible, as a result of her work and efforts. She currently lives in an adobe home, which she is renting. \r\n\r\nShe has seven years of experience cultivating cacao and other local products, thanks to a piece of land that her parents provided her with to be able to make her own income. She admits that it is not easy work, and that it is often necessary to hire local day laborers to remove unwanted plants that compete for the nutrients that are needed by the cacao trees in order for the fruit to have optimal growth.  \r\n\r\nShe is happy with her crops because a good amount of time has passed since her plants have been afflicted by anything bad or by tropical disease that directly harm cacao plantations. However, the rainy season does affect the normal care of the crop because the plot of land is positioned on an incline.  \r\n\r\nAfter all of these years of work, she has been presented with a good opportunity to buy a plot of land that will finally allow her to work towards her future plans of building her own home. This is only something to start with, since her long term goals include buying a bigger piece of property where she can start planting crops of achiote (also called annatto), turmeric and corn.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has taken out through MFP. She heard about micro-loans from people in her town, who said they were very happy with the efficiency of the micro-loans; she believed their comments and wanted to become a community bank member immediately. As it is her first experience with loans, she is thankful to the other community bank members for how they have welcomed her and the motivation they share. \r\n\r\nWith the 500 nuevos soles, she will add to the money she already had set aside for the purchase of a small plot of land for the future construction of her home.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1245259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy a small plot of land for her home.

In addition, there are businesses established here that generate important income transforming it into a commercial city with several opportunities for getting ahead.  Although there\u2019s a high poverty index, the enterprising spirit of its residents has made the city stand out.  Families can be found both in the rural and urban sectors that stand out because of their skills in taking off with an idea that can generate profits for them in order to obtain daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nVictor learned from his parents how to manufacture concrete blocks and thanks to his enterprising spirit has been doing this work for the last 32 years.

The main source of income for the family is the small monthly salaries of Nato\u2019s husband and her elder son. Her husband works as a cook and her son is an artisan.  Nato runs a small agricultural business. In particular, she has two milk cows whose milk is used in cheese products. The family sells hens as well and piglets seasonally.  \r\n\r\nNato has requested loan from local financial institutions several times for her trading business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected each time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers.  Her loan request with Credo was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative by Kiva and Credo.  This start-up loan program envisages provisioning credits with soft conditions for business start-up and re-startup to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nNato will purchase clothes in Tbilisi for wholesale prices and resell them in her village for a profit. It will be hard work for Nato, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of her family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the clothing trading business to increase her stocks and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs and improve their living conditions, and Nato will be able to finance the education of her child.

Their cheerful family includes three young children:  Edgar, Ruth, and Mar\u00eda.  Benancio and his family share a home made of wood, which he acquired at a very young age with the help of his parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe inherited a few plots of land from his grandparents, but he was able to expand his acreage by purchasing some additional plots that adjoined that property.  Benancio has six years of experience in this line of work.  He has several cacao trees since this area is well-suited for producing organic crops that are of high quality.  In addition, farming is an activity that has been practiced by his family for many generations.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order for the work to be done correctly, Benancio needs the help of workers who are reliable people from the area.  They will be able to complete the outstanding tasks in a shorter period of time.  This type of uniform and efficient maintenance is reflected in the final harvest.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the next growing season, Benancio plans to hire outside help to maintain his cacao trees.  He knows that cacao groves require weed removal three times throughout the season.  The first removal is usually the most difficult and detailed.  In addition, he wants to have organic compost and small tools available so that the outstanding work can be completed.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis goal for the future is to convert his business into a small-scale collection center of agricultural products.  Benancio hopes that the large-scale distributors will want to work with him in the future, which will create an opportunity for him to improve his family\u2019s financial condition.  This is the second time he has requested a loan from MFP.  Thanks to this loan, he will have everything he needs to invest in his farming business so that it will run smoothly.  Benancio and his fellow Communal Bank members share the same motivation, so he is grateful to be part of a group that is responsible and demonstrates great camaraderie.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500 PEN, Benancio will hire workers for the first round of weed removal from his cacao grove.  Any remaining funds will be used to buy sacks of organic compost, including bird droppings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1245320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers and to buy sacks of organic compost.

viven en Latacunga capital de la provincia de Cotopaxi, una de las provincias que forma parte de la Regi\u00f3n Sierra del Ecuador. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os Latacunga se ha desarrollado notablemente de tal forma que es considerada una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n gracias a la industria flor\u00edcola, minera, metal\u00fargica, agroindustria, agr\u00edcola y ganadera. Adem\u00e1s existen establecimientos de negocios que generan interesantes ingresos lo que le convierte en una ciudad comercial y con varias oportunidades para salir adelante. En esta ciudad muchas de las fiestas conservan un profundo arraigo y pureza muy cercanos a los or\u00edgenes hist\u00f3ricos o de la tradici\u00f3n ancestral. En cada fiesta la comida t\u00edpica, los bailes y las presentaciones art\u00edsticas son el centro de atenci\u00f3n de todos los habitantes y turistas. Hornado, cuyes, chugchucaras, etc, son algunos de los platos que se sirven al pasar por esta ciudad.\nJuan se dedica a la crianza de animales para su posterior venta, desde hace un a\u00f1o. Fue un reto bastante grande para \u00e9l y su familia comenzar con algo nuevo, pero la experiencia que sus vecinos y amigos le impartieron, le dieron la seguridad de seguir adelante y ha desempe\u00f1ado un trabajo excelente a pesar de haberse dedicado mucho tiempo a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bloques, pero el poco espacio que ten\u00eda en su casa no le permitieron continuar, es por eso que ahora en su tiempo libre ayuda a las bloqueras de los sectores aleda\u00f1os. Ahora la crianza de animales se ha convertido en su principal fuente de trabajo a la cual le dedica entre seis y ocho horas al d\u00eda y en donde adem\u00e1s recibe ayuda de su esposa, juntos trabajan inclusive las madrugadas para atender a los animales y cuidar su salud para que sean m\u00e1s demandados en el mercado. Juan est\u00e1 preparado para dar el siguiente paso en el crecimiento de su negocio, por lo que ahora requiere comprar m\u00e1s animales y as\u00ed obtener mayores ingresos que le ayuden a mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. Para realizar esta meta Juan ha solicitado a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual pueda hacer esta compra y adem\u00e1s aprovechar la oportunidad de capacitarse para llevar una correcta administraci\u00f3n de su negocio y los recursos que en el est\u00e1n invertidos. ","en":"Juan, 53, attended elementary school.  He\u2019s married to Carmen, 51, and they have two children who are 14 and 11 years old.  They live in Latacunga, capital of Cotopaxi Province one of the provinces that make up Ecuador\u2019s Sierra Region.  Latacunga has developed significantly in recent years to such an extent that it\u2019s considered to be one of the most important in the region thanks to its flower industry, mining, metallurgy, agroindustry, agriculture and animal husbandry.  Businesses that generate interesting income are also established here converting the city into a commercial center with several growth opportunities.  Many festivals occur in this city preserving the roots and purity of historical origins and ancestral traditions.  At every festival, traditional food, dances and artistic presentations are the center of attention for all inhabitants and tourists.  Some of the dishes that are served in this city are \u2018hornado\u2019 [roasted pig], guinea pigs, \u2018chugchucaras\u2019 [fried pork, 'mote'-boiled hominy, potatoes, fried plantains, turnovers, popcorn, and pork rinds; it is accompanied by aji, a spicy sauce made with hot peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, and onions], etc.\r\n\r\nJuan has worked for a year raising animals for subsequent sale.  It was quite a challenge for him and his family to start something new but the experience his friends and neighbors shared with him helped him to feel confident about continuing forward and he\u2019s done excellent work despite having worked for a long time manufacturing concrete blocks.  The little space he had available at home, however, made it impossible for him to continue with this so now he uses his free time to help out in nearby block factories.\r\n\r\nRaising animals has now become his main source of employment and he spends between six and eight hours daily at it; his wife helps him and they work together even at dawn to tend to their animals and care for their health so that they will be in higher market demand.  Juan is prepared to take the next step for his business\u2019 growth so wants to buy more animals to earn higher income that will help him improve his and his family\u2019s quality of life.

Alberto says that his business is profitable because he has a lot of customers.  He is also in an accessible area, and his earnings are always increasing.  Before starting his business, Alberto had financial problems- he didn't have enough capital to open a business.  But he got a loan and decided to start the business that he currently runs.  He hopes to keep his store going, to get ahead, and to increase his sales.  This will be his fourth loan with MFP.  He plans to continue being a reliable member of his communal bank.   In addition, the members of his communal bank are responsible and offer each other mutual support.  With the requested sum of 1000 soles (USD $400), Alberto will purchase larger quantities of merchandise to stock up his store, like rice, sugar, eggs and other items.  If his store offers a variety of products, he will have a greater number of customers, which will increase his earnings.

She does repairs and sewing of new clothing at the same time.\r\n\r\nShe received a few orders some time ago, but has not been able to fulfill them due to a lack of capital to buy the materials that she needs. For this reason, she seeks to overcome this difficulty by requesting a loan in order to buy raw materials and sewing supplies that will allow her to complete her customers\u2019 orders. Patience dreams of continuing to develop her business and gradually improving her business revenues. This will enable her to improve the facilities in her home and to have a better quality of life.

She is respected and known as a fair and purposeful woman. She is 41 years old. She is divorced and is raising three children. In her personal life she is not lucky, as her husband left her with three children, and does not even provide them with the necessary resources for living. It is difficult for Zulfiya to provide for the children. However her parents help her, even if she does not want help. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve their living conditions, Zulfiya decided to set up her own business for the good of the family. With this aim she attended the course \"Bring It On\", organized by the Association of Business Women and she received a certificate. Now she may organize her business and become successful in this area. \r\n\r\nZulfiya would like to set up a business of growing agricultural crops, as she has experience in this type of business.

is an artisan who specializes in African masks and sculptures. He would like to invest in the purchase of raw materials such as wood, aluminum plates and paints.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel has been selling through NOVICA since 2000. This is his story:\r\n\r\n\"After completing a course in auto mechanics, getting a job was difficult and neither my parents nor I could afford the high cost of the machinery I would need to set up on my own. I struggled while doing odd jobs, but I managed to save what I could until I had enough money to buy a small piece of land and put up a wooden store, but I didn't know what to sell. I started buying finished carvings, and in the evenings I learned to carve these beautiful items. My background in auto mechanics became very useful at this point because of my knowledge in cutting and designing of metals, as well as the skill I learned from my father who was a blacksmith. With constant practice, I entered the world of art.

She decided to lead an independent life with only her four children by her side, two of whom are young and still require her support and attention. She is the owner of a wooden house where she performs her duties as a mother. \r\n\r\nMaria produces agricultural products, among which is her preferred product, organic cacao, because it is a fruit in high demand in her region and it is easily grown in the area considering everything required. She carries out her agricultural activities on parcels of land she acquired with the help of her ex-partner 20 years ago. In order to obtain the quality of fruits that she wants, she must rely on additional help from laborers on site to carry out distinct complicated tasks. \r\n\r\nShe likes to work in the fields because it reminds her of times when she was a child together with her parents doing the same activities. However, by the time the cacao is ready there is a certain decrease in the final price offered by stockpilers. She is hoping to improve the situation for the next season.\r\n\r\nFinding herself at the start of the season whose harvest is projected for next year, she needs to have capital in order to continue to expand her plantations and to replace old cacao trees respectively. For this reason she needs seedlings, and manure compost from Guano Island. It is also necessary to add the cost of manual labor, whose payment is made in advance. \r\n\r\nNow she is asking for 1000 soles to buy seedlings and bags of compost. The remaining money will be used to supplement the capital to pay the laborers to develop scheduled tasks.

They decided to start together from a young age, driven by love and the special trust between them.  As a fruit of their relationship they have a precious little girl named Asulda, age 1, to whom they direct their future goals.  They live temporarily in an adobe house, which they rent.\r\n\r\nFor two years she has made a living with Ren\u00e1n in agricultural work on some plots of land her parents gave her because they're a young couple with a great desire to improve themselves.  Their main crop is organic cacao because it's very stable in the area.  As in any beginning they had certain problems trying to achieve financial stability for the future family.\r\n\r\nWhat's encouraging is that, in spite of starting out with little capital, they've managed to cover all the basic family expenses, considering that they already have the responsibility of their little girl.  Nevertheless, working together has been a great tool for unity because understanding and family harmony prevail in their family environment.\r\n\r\nA little while ago she received a proposal from a merchant in the area who offered to rent her his store for a long time because he plans to take a trip for a variety of reasons.  She considers it a good opportunity and plans to take it.  So she hopes to contribute to the family finances along with the field work with her husband in charge.\r\n\r\nShe has many desires for the future, including studying pharmacy at the advanced level because she feels she's capable of doing that in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She's very grateful for this opportunity, which she considers the motivation she needs right now to realize her commercial objectives more fluidly.  She's grateful to her colleagues in her communal bank for the great opportunity they're giving her and for their welcome, and she's committing herself to complying with all the stipulated agreements.\r\n\r\nWith the 500 nuevos soles [PEN] she'll supplement the capital she has dedicated to paying the first month's rent on a small grocery store that she'll manage from now

is 38 years old and lives with his family in their wooden house in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. His house is located in the boundary area of the city with no water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. Erdenekhuyag\u2018s family consists of four people: himself, his wife and two children who are students. In 2008 they bought the land and built a 60-square-meter wooden house. \r\nSince 2003, Erdenekhuyag has had a micro bus with 14 seats and with his wife runs a transportation business between Ulaanbaatar and a province 800 km away. He runs three times minimum in a month to Zavkhan province. \r\nAs his children grow the house is feeling smaller. Therefore Erdenekhuyag is planning to expand his house by building a new floor with wood and laying bricks on the outer side of the walls in order to stop the heat loss through the walls. By doing this Erdenekhuyag\u2019s family can improve their living condition and will have a spacious house that will serve them the rest of their life.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1245487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-11-28T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-28T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2046.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960461,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4093.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331095212,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5116.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484361,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4093.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347036873,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-28T09:22:41Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":502013,"name":"Jeshty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeshty is a 32 year old married woman and a mother of two young children ages eight and four.

Thanks to the previous loan Olga was able to buy used arches for the greenhouse and complete the building of two large greenhouses as well as significantly increase revenue from the garden and buy a tractor for cultivation of land. Moreover the family could afford to buy an inexpensive vehicle of local make.\r\n\r\nThis time Olga needs a loan in the amount of 20,000 hryvnia to install heating in the greenhouse: to buy a boiler for 10,000 hryvnia and hoses for installation costing 10,000 hryvnia. This will give her the opportunity to sell early vegetables at a higher price. At this time one of the major current issues for Olga is the long distance from the road and the market which makes it difficult to export products. Sometimes she has to ask some of the neighbors to transport the produce. Over time Olga hopes to purchase a vehicle for business to solve this urgent problem.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":1013637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for the business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was always rejected, due to lack of experience in a new business and her low income. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Marina will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase her income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in her business.

She says that farming has always been her hobby and this has made it more successful than she ever imagined. She, like any other farmer, faces the challenges of lack of enough water for her crops and lack of enough capital for expansion.\r\n\r\nShe has made her first loan request through Juhudi Kilimo for a loan of 40,000 KES in order to purchase irrigation equipment, including water pipes and a pump. This loan will enable her install irrigation equipment at her farm which she can use during the dry season. She says that this will ensure constant production throughout all seasons. The increased production will increase her income and improve her living standards.\r\n\r\nRosemary would like to acquire a pick-up truck in the near future to help transport her produce to the market

She previously accessed an 8,000 PHP loan that she used to purchase more quantities of different supplies and products needed in her business. Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education and in paying for her family's personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nNarlina would like to apply for another 15,000 PHP loan to buy more quantities of supplies such as a dust pan, mirror, hanger, pliers and other products for her business. The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profits, which will help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNarlina hopes to be able to expand her business in the coming years and dreams of giving her children a good and quality education.
