She is separated from the father of her 2 daughters, Diana (aged 14) and Nayeli (aged 8). Jauna lives in her own house with her children whom she loves very much; they are her stimulus for continuing ahead. Juana's activity is selling groceries of primary necessity, which she buys in the city's commercial centers and sells by order from her own house. She doesn't have a store but, rather, sells her products to neighbors on credit, collecting daily.\r\n\r\nJuana has had this business for over 3 years, during which she has tended her customers in a kind and cordial manner, earning their loyalty. She considers her earnings sufficient to allow her to sell on credit, but to do so, she has to raise prices considerably.\r\n\r\nJuana likes her business since it allows her to be at home to attend to her daughters, plus it offers a job, keeps her occupied and generates income to help cover household expenses and the education of her daughters. Consequently, seeing the good results from her business, she plans to continue, making it grow, acquiring more merchandise to re-stock, and offering more variety.\r\n\r\nThis will be Juana's 4th loan through MFP.

He works as a for-hire driver of a municipal shuttle taxi.  His monthly income is enough only to cover the family's expenses, and this is why he has an additional income from fattening up and selling livestock.  Previously, he used to help his father in this business and is now involved in fattening up livestock independently.  Doniyor wants to use this loan to buy a cow and livestock feed.

years old, married and raising two children, the youngest of whom is ten months old.  At the beginning of 2010, Damira and her husband bought a house in the Belovodskoe village and, in search of an income source for their family, started their own business in animal husbandry.

In 2010, while looking for a source of additional income for her family, she launched her own business selling spare parts at the market. Thanks to Uruila's persistence and hard work, she was able to develop her business so that it now makes 20,000 som (KGS) per month. Presently, the assortment of goods in the shop is not very wide, and for this reason Uruila has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 51,000 som (KGS).

La actividad que realiza Luz es la costura, oficio que aprendi\u00f3 estudiando en un centro de educaci\u00f3n ocupacional en otra ciudad, para luego comprar una maquina de coser con sus ahorros, y desde entonces instal\u00f3 en su propia casa un taller donde atender a sus clientes, quienes la buscan por sus buenos acabados, logrando ganarse  su aceptaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed la recomiendan con otras personas que luego se vuelven en sus clientes habituales.  Se inicio hace m\u00e1s de 4 meses en \u00e9ste negocio, realiz\u00e1ndolo ella sola.\nConsidera rentable su actividad por las ganancias que le deja que son mayores a su anterior negocio de venta de verduras. Le gusta la costura por el oficio y ocupaci\u00f3n que le brinda, que le vali\u00f3 para apoyar a su pareja a solventar los gastos de su hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de su hijo, quienes son su mayor motivaci\u00f3n para progresar.

Por tanto tiene  planes de ampliar su negocio y comprarse otras maquinas de coser para poder tener un mejor acabo en su costura. Este ser\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 3 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP, se siente agradecida con la ayuda financiera que viene recibiendo y desea continuar con este apoyo, por tanto se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas como en cr\u00e9ditos anteriores. Adem\u00e1s comenta estar a gusto con su grupo solidario ya que  conoce a la mayor\u00eda y los considera buenas personas.\nCon el monto solicitado de 1800 nuevos soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de 1 maquina de coser que sirve para estampar broches y botones valorizada en 250 nuevos soles y con el saldo tiene planeado comprar materiales de costura como telas, hilos, y dem\u00e1s.\n\n","en":"\r\nLuz, 30, is a cheerful woman who wants to improve; she\u2019s also nice and kind.  She\u2019s married to Gilder who is a laborer and the father of her only son, Alex, 11, who she wants to provide a better quality of life for.  She lives with her husband and son comfortably in their own house.  \r\n\r\nLuz\u2019s activity is sewing, an occupation she learned taking courses at an occupational education center in another city to then buy a sewing machine with her savings and since then has had a workshop at home where she takes care of customers who seek her out because of her good finishing touches thereby earning their acceptance; they recommend her to other persons who then become regular customers.  She started the business more than four months ago and she works by herself.\r\n\r\nShe considers her activity to be profitable because the profits she earns are greater than in her previous business which was selling vegetables.  She likes sewing as an occupation because of the work it generates that helped her support her spouse with household expenses and with her son\u2019s education costs; they are her greatest motivation to make progress.  But she also comments that it is a bit uncomfortable due to the physical fatigue  caused by sitting in the same position which causes backaches.  However, this doesn\u2019t discourage her and she continues working and putting in her best effort.  She plans to expand the business buying more sewing machines so that her work can have better finishing touches.  \r\n\r\nThis will be loan #3 from MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial help she\u2019s been getting and wants to continue with this support so she commits to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  She comments, too, that she\u2019s comfortable with her communal bank group because she knows most of them and considers them to be good people.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1800 new soles to buy a sewing machine that attaches clasps and buttons and has a value of 250 new soles and will use the remainder to buy sewing supplies like fabric, thread and the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1044135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a sewing machine, fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":273.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":280.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":293.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":305.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":316.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":329.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":207.88,"local_amount":554.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":554.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714130,"comment":null},{"amount":224.66,"local_amount":599.11,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":599.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098700,"comment":null},{"amount":118.79,"local_amount":316.77,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":317.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455855,"comment":null},{"amount":123.67,"local_amount":329.78,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":330.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452443,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

He therefore commits to be responsible with his installment payments like he\u2019s been in previous loans.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1500 new soles to buy the ingredients needed to prepare his snacks like flour, shortening, butter, oil and others looking for the best prices available for paying cash so that he can have stock on hand to prepare his products.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1044178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour, shortening, butter and oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":105.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":132.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":138.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":143.21},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":148.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":155.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.01},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.65,"local_amount":194.74,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":199.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714132,"comment":null},{"amount":40.61,"local_amount":105.94,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098702,"comment":null},{"amount":89.02,"local_amount":232.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":237.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401552,"comment":null},{"amount":46.65,"local_amount":121.71,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":124.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451510,"comment":null},{"amount":99.63,"local_amount":259.9,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":265.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446690,"comment":null},{"amount":53.01,"local_amount":138.28,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":141.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187775,"comment":null},{"amount":54.9,"local_amount":143.21,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339571842,"comment":null},{"amount":116.53,"local_amount":304,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121633,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-22T14:59:49Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407571,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip is 24 years old and single.

While she did that she suffered much because she had to be away from her children for long periods of time; she was unable to watch them grow up as she would have liked.  Because of that, once her seven children became independent she decided to change her workplace and start selling products at home to enjoy watching her youngest child grow up as well as to have more peace of mind and to be able to spend more time alongside her family.\r\n\r\nDuring these last two years that she\u2019s been working at home she\u2019s enjoyed every minute alongside her family and this is something she values highly.  She enjoys her work very much because she\u2019s in constant movement and she can attain good sales which produce good income.

permitido superarlas y continuar progresando junto a su familia. Desde muy peque\u00f1o inici\u00f3 una venta de snack con lo que se generaba su propio sustento y as\u00ed aligeraba la carga econ\u00f3mica de sus padres, que siempre tuvieron dificultades econ\u00f3micas. Hace un tiempo tuvo que cerrar una tienda que ten\u00eda por problemas de salud y gracias a la colaboraci\u00f3n que le brindaron sus hijos pudo superar sus quebrantes de salud. Hace poco tiempo volvi\u00f3 a abrir su tienda, pero ha presentado la dificultad de que el ser nuevo en el sector no es muy conocido por sus clientes, adem\u00e1s de que no cuenta con una puerta o ventana con la que se pueda hacer m\u00e1s visible para sus clientes, dificultad que ha venido superando ofreciendo una buena atenci\u00f3n. Otra dificultad que presenta es el poco capital con el que contaba en el momento de volver a abrir su tienda, por lo que a menudo no puede responder a los pedidos que le hacen sus clientes, por la poca variedad de productos que ha podido surtir en su tienda. Con el \u00e1nimo de superar estas adversidades, Gerardo busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a realizar una reforma locativa en su negocio para hacer una venta que le permita estar m\u00e1s visible para los clientes, y a comprar productos de la canasta familiar para ofrecer en su tienda.\n\nGerardo espera superar estas adversidades y continuar progresando en su vida, de modo que pueda tener una mejor estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y una mejor calidad de vida para \u00e9l y para su familia. \n","en":"Gerardo has had to deal with great difficulties throughout his life, but his determination to get ahead has always allowed him to overcome them and continue progressing with his family.  When he was very young he started selling snacks and generated enough income to support himself so as not to be an economic burden on his parents who always had economic difficulties.  Some time ago he had to close the store due to health issues, and thanks to his children's collaboration he was able to get his health back.  Recently he re-opened the store, but because he is new in the sector he is not well known by his customers, nor does he have a door or window which would make his business more visible to customers.  To compensate he offers good customer service.  Another difficulty he had was the lack of capital at the time he opened the store, which now means he cannot fill customer orders frequently because of a lack of product variety in the stock he keeps.  In order to overcome these adversities, Gerardo is requesting a loan to renovate his store and display his products, and also buy essential groceries for the family shopping basket.\r\n\r\nGerardo hopes to overcome these challenges and continue getting ahead so he can attain economic stability and a better lifestyle for himself and his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1044440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To renovate

She and her life partner have six children, ages 24, 23, 20, 18, 15, and 8.  They still live with her even though only the four minors are dependent upon her for food and education.  She has her own house where she lives with her six children and her life partner.\r\n\r\nShe works a lot in order to give her family a better quality of life.  Lucila sells food.  In the afternoons she goes out to the sidewalk to her house where her children help her set up a large table, the grill, the roaster, and the benches.  Then she stokes the charcoal fire and starts with the work of selling the most delicious and flavorful dishes like \u201cjuanes\u201d (a traditional chicken and rice meal) and \u201ctacacho\u201d (a Peruvian dish of fried plantain mashed with pork rind), etc.\r\n\r\nDue to the good seasoning of her food she has a lot of loyal customers because she always gives them a little bit larger portion.  She has been working for a year and a half.  She is happy that it is going well for her, and she can therefore generate income for her household.  The thing she likes about her work is that in the morning she is able to use her time for other activities, which are also fundamental to her income.\r\n\r\nShe has customers every day because she is located in an area that is very accessible to the public.  This allows her to increase her daily income and to provide her family with better living conditions.  In the future she hopes to strengthen the restaurant that she set up with the previous loan.  It is in the process of expanding.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your contribution in order to continue with her objectives.  She pledges once again to make her payments as she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy to belong to her communal bank and to be able to shape a group where all of the people are responsible and supportive.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,500 soles to buy ingredients, supplies, and utensils in order to continue her work.  She wishes to be set up with more things in order to give her customers better service.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":1044571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients, cooking supplies, and kitchen utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":388.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":396.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":394.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":425.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":441.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":453.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":298.22,"local_amount":784.79,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":795.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714139,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":394.74,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":400.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203036,"comment":null},{"amount":161.79,"local_amount":425.76,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":431.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098709,"comment":null},{"amount":339.99,"local_amount":894.71,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":907.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-16T17:48:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407603,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victor is 32 years old from Nakuru.

They sold several heads of livestock after family events (a wedding), and his business began to decline.  This may get reflected in lowering the level of living.

In his free time he goes to church where he helps out the priest with some activities.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s been doing his work for more than four years having learned from a very good teacher who gave him the exact guidance to make excellent work.  He likes what he does because he can express his feelings and hopes in each piece of work or building that he makes.  He also earns good income that gives him peace of mind with respect to food and education for his family.  He wants to continue working so that later on he can install a well-equipped workshop at home.\r\n\r\nThis will be loan #3 with MFP and he hopes this small loan will help him reach his goals.  He commits once more to make his installment payments in a punctual and very responsible way like he\u2019s done with previous loans he\u2019s gotten.  He is very happy to belong to his communal bank because all the members are very good and supportive.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 1200 soles to buy supplies and tools to continue doing his work.

adversidades que le ha presentado la vida ha tenido la fortaleza para seguir adelante y continuar progresando junto con su familia. Luz Dary trabaja como empleada dom\u00e9stica y con esto aporta econ\u00f3micamente en su hogar para el sostenimiento de sus hijos, sin embargo, los ingresos que genera no son suficientes en algunos momentos para cubrir todos los gastos que se generan en su hogar. Hace un tiempo Luz Dary cultivaba en un terreno que tiene detr\u00e1s de su casa algunas verduras, sin embargo, por los fuertes inviernos de la \u00e9poca y el poco capital con el que contaba para poder sostener sus cultivos se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de cerrarlo y dejarlo a un lado por un tiempo. Actualmente, Luz Dary espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de semilas, riegos y abonos para poder reiniciar su cultivo de verduras y as\u00ed generar ingresos adicionales para su familia.\n\nLuz Dary espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues ya tiene experiencia en la actividad de cultivar verduras y con esto podr\u00e1 suplir mayores necesidades que ahora. Adem\u00e1s, Luz Dary espera que con mayores ingresos su hija pueda acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de mayor calidad y a mejores oportunidades econ\u00f3micas que les permita progresar con mayor facilidad. \n","en":"\r\n\u201cCharismatic\u201d and \u201cHardworking\u201d are the best words to describe Luz Dary, a person who despite the great adversities life has thrown in her path, has had the strength to continue forward and make progress with her family.\r\n\r\nLuz Dary works as a domestic employee and contributes economically this way to her home to support her children.  However, income generated is insufficient at present to cover all her household expenses.  \r\n\r\nSome time ago, Luz Dary used to farm vegetables on a parcel of land behind her house.  However, due to the strong winters in the season and the little available capital she had to maintain her crops she had to close it and leave it aside for a time.  Now, Luz Dary hopes that the loan will make it possible for her to buy seeds, irrigation and manure to restart her vegetable farming thus generating additional income for her family.\r\n\r\nLuz Dary hopes that this way her income will increase considerably because she already has vegetable farming experience and she could cover more needs this way.  Also, Luz Dary hopes that with higher income her daughter can access a higher quality education and better economic opportunities that will allow them to make progress more easily.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1045501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sonson","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-04-05T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-05T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Dary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":49850},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":51252},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":52694},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":54176},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55700},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":57267},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":58878},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60534},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":62237},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":63987},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":65787},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":67638}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.57},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.69,"local_amount":50209,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50524.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902578,"comment":null},{"amount":29.46,"local_amount":51559,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51883.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326928,"comment":null},{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":52436,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52765.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432317,"comment":null},{"amount":62.56,"local_amount":109468,"processed_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":110156.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432981,"comment":null},{"amount":32.27,"local_amount":56465,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":56819.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640376,"comment":null},{"amount":68.69,"local_amount":120214,"processed_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":120969.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029451,"comment":null},{"amount":72.13,"local_amount":126224,"processed_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548111,"comment":null},{"amount":37.07,"local_amount":64872,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T11:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":65279.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356517359,"comment":null},{"amount":39.17,"local_amount":68553,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68983.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364552536,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-06T09:40:46Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:08:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407619,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 40 years old, and is married with three children. \r\n\r\nLucy does tailoring to earn a living.

Being a responsible and very active person in life, Anzirat worked as a foreman of a farming business and was elected as the leader of the village elders court in the Markaz village several years ago.  In 1996, in search of a source of income for her family, she started her own farming business - growing onions, with an initial amount of  10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Anzirat's persistence and hard work, she was able to grow her business to have a seasonal income of 50,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Anzirat requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy onion seeds and fuel. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further development of her

She is an enterprising, dynamic and creative woman. She is a single-mother of a twelve-year-old child. It is for this child\u2019s education and sustenance that she struggles and sacrifices. She owns a house, where she lives with her father. She makes fari\u00f1a (a local product made from yucca flour). She also sells the material used in the production of farina. When there aren\u2019t enough yuccas to make the flour, she goes some distance to look for wholesalers who sell yucca. She goes to the city to sell her product at retail prices.  She has been doing this business for the past eight years. She does this business on her own and she always provides a good product. What she likes the best about her work is that she doesn\u2019t have set hours. She is able to spend time with her father and her child. Her customers like this crisp product. This is why she searches for the best of the best ingredients, so that her customers are happy. Her business is going well even though prices have been going up because it is not the yucca season. This is temporary and the prices will go down. In the future she hopes to expand her business by bringing regional products to sell at the wholesale market. This is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy with them as they provide her with financial backing. In this way she can increase her working capital. She knows that she needs to be very responsible and more importantly, very punctual. She is happy to be part of the community bank as they are very united. With this loan of 1500 soles, she will buy yucca in order to continue her business. She would like to sell her product on the highways in order to gain new customers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1045561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy yuccas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T00:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T00:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":237.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":236.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":255.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":265.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":271.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":180.57,"local_amount":471.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":482.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714143,"comment":null},{"amount":90.81,"local_amount":236.92,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":242.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203040,"comment":null},{"amount":97.96,"local_amount":255.54,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":261.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098713,"comment":null},{"amount":101.61,"local_amount":265.07,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":271.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401563,"comment":null},{"amount":104.05,"local_amount":271.43,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":278.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455861,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T20:54:39Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408035,"name":"Vicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicent has been in the tea business for five years.

Maria is a single mother and the head of a family with two children, since the father of her children died some time ago and left her a widow and in charge of the household. Since then, Maria has been working hard as a domestic employee, and thanks to this she generates income with which she can support the household expenses. Nevertheless, many times the income that she generates is not sufficient to cover all the household expenses, and for this reason she wants to look for a way to generate additional income for her family. At a very early age, Maria learned how to raise chickens, since she lived for a long time on a farm, and there she acquired a lot of experience. With the intention of resuming this activity, Maria is seeking a loan that will offer her the possibility of constructing a shed to use as a chicken coop, purchasing chickens and caring for them, and thus resuming this activity with which she will be able to generate extra income in her home.\r\n\r\nMaria hopes that in this way her monthly income will continue growing considerably and, in addition, she will be able to create a better quality of life for her two children.

For two years she has been offering her customers different styles of very good quality and modern shoes, sandals and trainers. As all good women that wish to progress, she has many plans for her life, amongst them are giving her children a good education and being able to have a prosperous business that is profitable, but she knows that she still has a long way to go and for the moment she just wants to consolidate herself more in what she is doing, and later expand her business with other products.

This group is made up of 11 people who have distinguished themselves for being a group that makes its payments on time and they say the key is being a very close group with a lot of communication.\n\nSandra is one of the women in the group. She is 35 years old and lives with her husband. They have 2 children, a 12 year old boy and a 7 year old girl. They are in middle and primary school. Seven months ago, Sandra decided to open a small paper store in her home. She has stocked it little by little, but she still needs a wider variety of products to compete with the more established paper stores in the neighborhood. She hopes that with the help of this loan, she will finally be able to stock her store with the products she is lacking to be able to establish herself as one of the leading paper stores in the neighborhood. She hopes that in the next few years she can keep growing with her business and someday enlarge the space where she has her paper store.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6275,"image":{"id":1045880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to finish stocking her paper store and enlarge it more.

Rose also operates as a wholesaler of bananas which she sources from her farm and from other farmers in the area.<p>\r\n\r\nRose has requested a loan of 60,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to help her buy irrigation equipment in order to expand her banana farming. She hopes to do well with the expansion since she has a strong market base for her products. The income will help her to pay the college tuition fees for her last-born child.\r\n<p>\r\nRose says the high costs of farming inputs is a deterrent to many people considering entry into the farming business.

is photographed in his barber shop.  He is a thirty-five-year-old man, married and a father with two sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past five years, Mohammad has been running a barber shop, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income to the family.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new barber kit such as: hair dryers, hair brushes and hair and face creams. This will improve Mohammad's work and increase the size of his work and so improve the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.

In search of a source of income for her family, Mukhabat became involved in animal husbandry in 2003, having started this business with an initial amount of 5,000 som (KGS).  Today, her business contains two dairy cows, three calves and forty sheep.  The earnings from sale of milk and meat products amount to about 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Mukhabat requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock. She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a further expansion of her business.

If he can see his family happy, then he is capable of all that and much more.

Thanks to Nazira's persistent and dedicated work, her herd currently has 3 dairy cows and 6 sheep, and earns her roughly 10,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her business, Nazira has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to purchase calves for fattening and resale.

While searching for a source of income for her family, in 2000 Begimjan started her own livestock business by buying 2 dairy cows.

Orlando's work consists of transporting passengers and freight into and out of the city, leaving very early in the morning from his house and going to the the closest market where he waits for passengers to take his motorcycle taxi.  He then is in charge of carrying them safe and sound to their destinations.  During the entire time that he has been carrying out this job, (18 years), he has learned many things and has several shortcuts and also areas in which he knows that prices have to be a bit higher.  His work is going very well due to the fact that he already knows how to carry out his job in the best way, as well as permitting him to have time to take his children to and from school.  He is very content, as on some occasions he has clients that contract him for hours at a time and which allows him to work less and to reduce the wear and tear on his motor.  Now he is waiting to improve the condition of his motorcycle taxi and to buy himself another one to rent out and gain an additional profit.  This will be his second loan with MFP, and therefore awaits your collaboration to continue with his goals.  He is also committed again to make his payments as in the other loans he has received.  He is very happy to be a part of his community bank since everyone is very united and responsible.  With the requested amount of 1000 soles, he will purchase replacement parts and will order repairs for a few parts that are deteriorating through time, as well as to purchase insurance to to be able to guarantee the passengers he carries to their destinations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1048785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase replacement parts and to repair his motorcycle taxi, and to be able to update his transportation insurance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":115.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":111.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":128.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":140.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.47,"local_amount":230.59,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":230.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714153,"comment":null},{"amount":41.9,"local_amount":111.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":111.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203051,"comment":null},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":123.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":123.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098724,"comment":null},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":127.8,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":128.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401574,"comment":null},{"amount":48.26,"local_amount":128.7,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455871,"comment":null},{"amount":51.52,"local_amount":137.37,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":137.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451522,"comment":null},{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446702,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:10:58Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405873,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda de 39 a\u00f1os de edad  casado con Jes\u00fas de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, fruto de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen 3 hijos, ellos viven en el distrito de Llochegua.

They all live together in their own house located in the settlement of Mantaro in Pichari District. \r\n\r\nPilar has been farming bananas and cocoa beans in Mantaro for five years.  At first she started farming bananas but soon introduced cocoa beans which are in their first fruit production phase.  She decided to grow cocoa beans because it has a very good market price like bananas.  To date, everything is turning out very well but her inconvenience is that her parcel of land is on the banks of the Apurimac River and every winter the river overflows its banks and washes away her crops.  Because of this she\u2019s thinking about buying a new parcel of land where she can continue growing her crops.\r\n\r\nPilar is happy with the work she does because thanks to her good production her family has a dignified life.\r\n\r\nThis is her second MFP loan so she commits to make her installment payments punctually.

She is married to Jose, who is employed, and they have 2 beautiful children: Rosa, aged 18, and Renzo, aged 7, whom they love a lot.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Deyba has a business selling groceries.  She sells from a store that is set up in her own house.  This is where she tends to her customers, who are mainly her neighbors.  She started this business more than 2 years ago because she needed to have additional income.  She took some small capital that she had saved up, and together with a loan, she managed to buy some small quantities of merchandise.  In this way she attracted customers.  She thinks that her business is profitable because of the good earnings it gives her, and because it has been well-received by her customers.  She enjoys the business because it allows her to stay in her house and also enjoy the tranquility of having an income.  In addition, she can use her free time to care for her house.  However, she doesn't like it when her customers request to make their purchases on credit, because she has had some bad experiences with these types of sales when people fail to make their payments.  For this reason she no longer sells on credit, making all of her sales on a cash basis.  But as she is seeing good results, she has plans to continue to grow and expand her business.  This will be her 2nd loan with MFP, and she feels grateful for the financial support to implement her plans.  Also, she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she knows the members and considers them to be responsible and supportive people.  \r\n\r\nWith the sum of 1,000 Peruvian soles she requests, she will invest in the purchase of groceries at wholesale, looking for the lowest prices so that she can obtain the highest profits.  She thinks that with a larger quantity and variety of products, her business will continue to be popular and her earnings will increase.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1050493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy consumer staples to stock her business\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-04-06T22:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-06T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deyba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":151.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":165.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":172.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":185.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":151.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":151.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714161,"comment":null},{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":150.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203060,"comment":null},{"amount":61.97,"local_amount":165.27,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":165.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098732,"comment":null},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":172.21,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":172.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401583,"comment":null},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":175.54,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455879,"comment":null},{"amount":69.74,"local_amount":185.98,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":186.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451528,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-15T22:35:25Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408879,"name":"Geoffrey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geoffrey is a 40 year old a business man, and he is married to Joyce, a business lady.

She runs a grocery store out of her home. About six years ago she was working at a warehouse, and because she didn't have any help taking care of her kids she had to take on the least amount of work. The place where she worked was located on a big avenue, so her young daughter played near to where the cars were passing by. Martha Alicia was worried about her daughter's security, so she decided to leave her work and set up a store in her house. She dreams of buying a copy machine and establishing a stationery store, since there isn't this type of business where she lives. Later on, she wants to purchase a plotter (high-powered printer).

With increased amount of cows, the family will be able to produce and sell more cheese and increase the income of the family.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1057096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase materials for cattle-shed construction.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ghordze","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-04-07T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-07T04:30:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beglar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":136.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":143.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":171.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":177.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":186.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189.42},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":196.31},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":202.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":208.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.79},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.44},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.72},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.32},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.52,"local_amount":104.06,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":105.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283194598,"comment":null},{"amount":84.77,"local_amount":136.73,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":138.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287358254,"comment":null},{"amount":89.05,"local_amount":143.63,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":145.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294394447,"comment":null},{"amount":90.5,"local_amount":145.96,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":148.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301449288,"comment":null},{"amount":93.47,"local_amount":150.77,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":153.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209491,"comment":null},{"amount":97.76,"local_amount":157.68,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":160.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440257,"comment":null},{"amount":1029.93,"local_amount":1661.17,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323045339,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-07T01:07:28Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:14:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409281,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is 48 years old, married and has 5 children.
