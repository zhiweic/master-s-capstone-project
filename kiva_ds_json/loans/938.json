Debido a que en el sector le han puesto mucha competencia abriendo tiendas de este mismo tipo, Erika requiere diferenciarse de la competencia para poder conservar sus clientes; es por esto que busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar productos de la canasta familiar con los que pueda diversificar los productos que ofrece a sus clientes y as\u00ed superar la competencia que le han puesto en el sector.\n\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es brindarle a sus 2 hijos una educaci\u00f3n de buena calidad y poderles ofrecer un futuro econ\u00f3mico estable con el que puedan salir adelante. Tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1a con que su negocio crezca y en un futuro pueda ser una fuente de ingresos que les permita progresar econ\u00f3micamente. \n","en":"Erika is a young entrepreneur who opened a general store a few years ago looking to improve the economic condition her household had when she lived with her parents.  Now that she\u2019s married and  has two children, this is a source of income that allows her to help her husband maintain a better quality of life at home and to have better opportunities for economic progress.  \r\n\r\nDespite not having much capital, her business has moved forward thanks to her great effort and she\u2019s been increasing the variety of products she has available for her customers.  Because she\u2019s gotten much competition with similar stores opening up locally, Erika wants to stand out from the competition in order to retain her customers which is why she\u2019s seeking a loan to buy basic staple items to diversify her inventory of products on sale to her customers to overcome the competition that\u2019s arisen in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to provide her two children with a quality education and a future that\u2019s economically stable so that they can get ahead.  She also dreams with her business growing and in future becoming a source of income that will allow them to progress economically.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":771.89,"image":{"id":1172167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Using these funds, he was able to purchase tools for manufacturing furniture - an air compressor and a pneumatic stapler. This equipment has made work easier, and also improved the quality of the final product by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, Viktor was able to buy tools for manufacturing tents - now he and his staff can make tarpaulins for trucks. Since receiving his last loan from Kiva, Viktor and his family have finished home repairs and moved into their own house, while previously they lived in an apartment. Now everyone in their large family has more space. Finally, Viktor also expanded his business - he rented a large workshop with a big yard, which has given him enough space for making both furniture and tarpaulins.\r\n\r\nViktor is planning to invest his next Kiva loan of 10 000 hryvnia into purchasing additional materials for his business, namely foam, fabric, wood and other consumables. The loan will enable him to keep stocks of such materials on hand, instead of always waiting for them to arrive. Accordingly, with these Kiva funds Viktor will accelerate the turnaround of his orders. Fall is a busy time for orders, and he wants to be ready. Viktor considers that the main obstacle in his work is finding and training new employees, as the training takes a long time, while many people eventually leave the job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":817054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to

Es por esto que Amelia decidi\u00f3 esforzarse y con unos peque\u00f1os ahorros que ten\u00eda inici\u00f3 su propio negocio de venta de licores el cual gracias a su esfuerzo ha podido sacar adelante e ir superando las dificultades que se le presentan, principalmente la falta de capital para surtir. Gracias a que ha tenido buenas ventas, Amelia busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar licores y surtir su negocio con productos que ya se han ido agotando.\n\nDe esta manera podr\u00e1 superar la dificultad de capital que tiene en su negocio y as\u00ed seguir\u00e1 teniendo unos ingresos que le permitan ofrecerles a sus 3 hijos el acceso a la educaci\u00f3n universitaria. Su sue\u00f1o es poder tener un gran negocio con el que su familia tenga una mejor calidad de vida y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica que les permita progresar. \n","en":"Amelia\u2019s a very hardworking person who has been moving her own business forward with much effort. She started it three years ago looking for better economic conditions for her home.  She used to work as an employee selling liquor and contributed her salary to help her husband cover household expenses but this was insufficient to cover all costs at home where she lives with her husband and three children who are currently attending university.  \r\n\r\nBecause of this, Amelia decided to make the effort and use a little saving she had to start her own business selling liquor and thanks to her efforts she\u2019s managed to move it forward and gradually overcome the economic difficulties that have arisen, especially the lack of capital to restock.  Thanks the good sales she\u2019s had, Amelia is looking for financing to buy liquor to stock her store with products that she\u2019s been running out of.\r\n\r\nIn this way she will be able to overcome the problem of lack of business capital and will continue to earn income that will make it possible to continue to offer her three children access to a university education.  Her dream is to have a great business through which her family can have a better quality of life and economic stability that will allow for economic progress.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":1172235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

is Cristina, resident of Manila, Philippines. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCristina retails processed meat products. What she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers and then she sells them per piece\/pack with a profit. Products can range from ham, hotdogs, and processed pork to other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCristina hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosefina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 37,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJosefina hopes to grow her business and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

The expression \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" symbolises someone with a kind heart, and worthy actions. The group has had 300 members since 2009. Its goal is to bring its members together and to allow them to conduct their various activities - namely agricultural and fish production, general import export business, transport, factory work, skilled labour, construction, animal rearing, mining, fishing, oil drilling, art and culture, printing and woodwork, public services, legal services, fish processing, agriculture, sale of spare parts, ice making, baking, and the provision of general services.\r\nThe group aims also to strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between its members in order to help them obtain the necessary practical and financial means to develop their revenue generating activities - such that all benefit from the advantages of group membership.\r\nIt is in this spirit that a heads of agreement has been signed between the group and UIMCEC, to the benefit of the group members on a national level. The first phase of the project has focused on a sample of 120 active group members, divided into 12 sub-groups of 10 people.\r\n\"MAKARIMAL Akhlakh group 5\" is a group of 10 members who offer their various services in the same market. They are represented by Dethi\u00e9 (dressed in purple in the photo). She has sold fabrics for the last 8 years, as well as crockery and ladies handbags. \r\nShe is a member of the UIMCEC and spends nine hours daily on her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase stock. Her plan is to diversify the range of goods she sells.\r\nThe profits generated from this will enable her to cover her childrens' schooling costs, and also to be able to put some money into savings. Her plan is to buy a plot of land for her

Su nuevo cr\u00e9dito lo va a invertir en la compra de licras, chompas y lencer\u00eda para continuar con su negocio. La banca comunal le gusta porque los cr\u00e9ditos son f\u00e1ciles y no necesitan muchos tr\u00e1mites.\n","en":"This communal bank is made up, in large part, of relatives who live in Tarqui parish in Cuenca. This area has large plains conducive to cattle raising. Its parish center is a mixture of the colonial and the modern and its people still maintain the culture and traditions inculcated by their parents.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Srta. Martha who is on her third loan in the communal bank. She is single and is 31 years old. She lives in her parents\u2019 home and shares household expenses with them. Her father is a professional tailor and her mother is a farmer. The house where they live is owned by her parents. \r\n\r\nMartha sells clothing by catalog and also raises animals, especially cattle. Formerly she sold cosmetics but this did not go well for her because of the competition and she decided to engage in clothing sales, which are currently doing very well. She has chosen to run these businesses because they allow her to be financially independent.\r\n\r\nShe invested her earlier loan in the purchase of clothing which enabled her to have more variety and attract more customers, however due to an infection she had, she fell behind a bit in making the payments on her loan. Now, however, the debt has been completely paid off. Her new loan will be invested in purchasing Lycra (items made of spandex), sweaters and lingerie so that she can continue with her business. \r\n\r\nThe members of the communal bank like being able to obtain loans easily and without going through so much red tape.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":1020296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase Lycra, sweaters and lingerie.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-09-03T21:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-03T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Ver\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo Leonardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":480,"local_amount":480,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:51:14Z","rounded_local_amount":480,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150562,"comment":null},{"amount":480,"local_amount":480,"processed_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":480,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990667,"comment":null},{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990668,"comment":null},{"amount":423.98,"local_amount":423.98,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":423.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339518034,"comment":null},{"amount":56.02,"local_amount":56.02,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":56.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526245,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-06T03:13:08Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T10:40:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467264,"name":"Saron","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saron lives in a rural area of the Ponhea Krek district of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.

is Nida, a 54-year-old mother and resident of Payatas, Philippines who is married to Romeo. She and her children manage their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nNida operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials which they sell to junk shops for a small profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries. <p>\r\n\r\nNida also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales everyday.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 16,000 loan to help buy scrap materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  <p>\r\n\r\nNida hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to provide her children with a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work.

She and her husband have three children, with whom they live in their own house.\r\n\r\nShe has worked in agriculture since the age of 17, when she helped her parents in the field. For this reason, she also teaches her knowledge to her children.

For this reason she turns to hired help when these seasons arrive. What she likes most is selling her products. She takes them to the city located an hour and a half away.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \n\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first stage  has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\n\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 8 has ten members who are part of the EIG, and who all live in the same neighborhood. They are represented by Raya, a married woman who has worked for ten years selling fabrics, crockery, shoes, and ladies\u2019 bags. She regularly travels to a country beside Senegal, where she buys her supplies. \n\nRaya is a member of a UIMCEC branch, and has requested a loan to have enough capital to finance her next trip. The profits that her business generates allow her to cover a large portion of her personal needs, to help her relatives, and to cover her children\u2019s education. Her main goal is to increase her savings, as well as to acquire a large store in the market where she can carry out her business.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1184005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To have enough capital to travel and buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbousse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieynaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kouly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Kine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ata  D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467738,"name":"Maka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maka is 33 years old and lives in a refugee settlement in Tserovani.

By 2009, GIE had 300 members. It's goal is to unite its members and allow them to carry out their agricultural production and fishery activities, their general importing and exporting activities, and their transportation, industrial, artisan, building, animal raising, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, artistic and cultural, printing, carpentry, services and actions for the public good, representation, processing of fishery products, agricultural, sale of spare parts, ice-making, and bakery activities, as well as provide various services.\r\n\r\nGIE also aims to consolidate the ties of friendship and solidarity between its members to allow them to acquire the necessary material and financial means to develop their revenue-generating activities and to benefit from all of the advantages that GIE offers. And it's against this background that an agreement was signed between GIE and UIMCEC for the benefit of the GIE members at the national level. The first phase applied to a sample of 120 active members divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nThe Makarimal  Akhlakh Groupe 7 group is is made up of ten GIE members who are all involved in the same business. They are represented by Abdoulaye, who has been selling fruit for several years now. His workday begins every morning and finishes at midnight. He is a member of a branch of the UIMCEC, and he is seeking a loan to buy fruits that he will resell.\r\n\r\nIncreasing his capital will allow him to stock up in greater quantity, consequently saving him time and reducing the costs associated with his daily commutes. The revenue that he earns from his business allows him to pay for the education of his children and support his family. His goal is to save enough money to start importing and exporting within the next two years.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1183981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \r\n\r\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first phase has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 10 is a mixed sub-group with ten members, who all belong to the Makarimal Akhlah EIG and carry out their daily profit-making businesses in the same market.

is 50-year-old Amadu. He is married and has five children, age 7, 8, 14, 16 and 18 years; they are all school going children. \r\n\r\nIn 1991, Amadu established his dried fish business. He began his business because he came from a poor background. His parents were not educated and they did not know the value of education. Instead, they trained him in their life of business. He used to join his father in islands and villages to buy and trade dried fish. He was raised to be a fish monger.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and seven hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,837,000 every month from this business. Changes in price are his major problem.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. Amadu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase five baskets of dried fish @ SLL 800,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Amadu plans to see his children through university.

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \r\n\r\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first phase has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 11 is a mixed sub-group with ten members, who all belong to the Makarimal Akhlah EIG and carry out their daily profit-making businesses in the same market. They are represented by Ndeye Coura, a married woman who has worked in retail for eight years selling food products. She is a member of UIMCEC, and has requested a loan to increase her working capital so that she can diversify the food products she sells. An increase in her profits will allow her to improve her family\u2019s food conditions, provide for her children\u2019s education, help her relatives and save money. In the future she would like to become a large retailer in the import-export field, and to run a large store in the market in the Senegalese capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5750,"image":{"id":1184218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

The term \"Makarimal Akhlakh\" means a person who has a good heart and good practices. \r\n\r\nThe EIG has reached 300 members since 2009. Its objective is to unite its members and allow them to exercise farming and fishing activities, general import and export trading activities, transport, industrial, artisanal, building, livestock farming, mining, fishing, hydrocarbon exploitation, art and cultural, printing, carpentry, public utility services, representation, processing of fishing and farming produce, sale of spare parts, ice-cream making, and bakery businesses, as well as the provision of other services. The EIG also aims to consolidate friendship and solidarity links between its members so that they can obtain the material and financial resources necessary to develop their income-generating activities and benefit from all the advantages relating to the EIG. Within this context a protocol agreement has been signed between the EIG and UIMCEC, to benefit the members of the EIG across the country. The first phase has been applied to a sample of 120 active members, divided into 12 groups of 10.\r\n\r\nMakarimal Akhlakh Group 12 is a mixed sub-group with ten members, who all belong to the Makarimal Akhlah EIG and carry out their daily profit-making businesses in the same market. They are represented by Babacar, a single man who has worked in retail for seven years selling clothing and shoes. He is a member of UIMCEC, and has requested a loan to increase his working capital so that he can diversify the products he sells, as well as to develop and expand his retail business. An increase in his profits will allow Babacar to financially support his parents and save money so that, in the future, he can realize his dream of becoming a large retailer in the import-export field.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1184318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy shoes and clothing for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":5750,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Babacar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibrahima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mady","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Gueye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nene Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Bigue","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":5750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467760,"name":"Mohamed M.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 32-year-old Mohamed M.

Charbel has always wanted to better develop his business and improve his work, but he has never had enough income. For that reason, he decided to take a loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to purchase a car in order to facilitate transportation to his clients' homes.

He studied electrical engineering at the Universidad del Norte.  He did this thanks to the many years of their lives that his parents saved for Emanuel\u2019s and his four siblings\u2019 education.\r\n\r\nEmanuel\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in Belgium or Holland.  The support from Kiva will help him to be able to pay the registration and preparation fees for the TOFEL and GRE exams.  Once he gets his Master\u2019s and returns to Colombia, Emanuel dreams of working on projects to develop a society with clean and sustainable energy.  He especially would like to work for a hydroelectric power plant.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that I have my family\u2019s support to fulfill this dream, my parents are not able to cover such high costs as this due to their limited financial situation.  Also, since I got my degree in 2011, it took me a year to get a job with a very low salary.  Kiva would be the support I need to take the first steps on this long road.  It would also be the catalyst to be able to get my Master\u2019s abroad.  I do not want to give up on meeting this objective.  I know that, thanks to my academic excellence and great effort, I can do it.\r\n\r\nIt would be a great source of immeasurable pride for me to know that I can contribute to the implementation of a model where the industrial sector really backs self-sustainability for the public.  The central idea is the use of renewable energy.  I realize that a Master\u2019s at one of the best universities in Europe would give me the tools and the knowledge needed to manage this undertaking.\r\n\r\nColombia, and South America in general, as an emergent economic block are the ideal settings for the implementation of this business model.  This is true not only because they have the needed natural resources, but also because it is early enough to avoid the errors committed by the more industrialized countries.\r\n\r\nThat is why I wish to work for a Colombian business that has this type of vision.  This way I will contribute all of my knowledge and effort to find a solution for this complex problem.  The only guarantee I have is to give the best of myself in order to fulfill my dream.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1186545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

is 50 years old. He lives in Khoni District, West Georgia with his wife Gulnara and 22-year-old daughter. Nugzar requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was always rejected, because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNugzar\u2019s wife Gulnara lives abroad. She works abroad and sends part of her income to her family. Nugzar is leading his family's small-scale agricultural business. He runs a family-owned dairy farm with two milk cows. Nugzar produces cheese and sells it in the village. The family's average monthly income is 200 GEL. It is not enough to provide Nugzar and his daughter with normal living conditions. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nNugzar requested a loan from Credo to re-start his family business, which was stopped a couple of years ago because of financial problems. His loan request was approved as part of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit for business start-up and re-start-up with fewer conditions to the country's rural poor. This population is often considered \"high risk borrowers\" because of low incomes, and they often do not have access to credit. With the credit, Nugzar will purchase chickens to start a poultry farm. He will place the chickens in a shed located in their yard. He will raise them and sell them for a higher price. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family. Nugzar and his daughter also hope that the income will be enough for the family so that Gulnara will be able to return home and work in the family business.

She continued with her little business.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le832,000 every month from this business. Fatmata would like a loan in the amount of Le5,000,000. She requires a loan in order to purchase plastic chairs - 140 pieces @ Le35,000, with the balance of Le100,000 used for transport. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata hopes to be an importer.  The loan will help as it is additional capital for her business.  Fatmata\u2019s main challenge is the poor road network. Transportation from Liberia to Sierra Leone causes a lot of stress and inconvenience.  She is hoping to acquire subsequent loans from this credit service in order to develop her business and improve her standard of living.   She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1182500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase plastic chairs - 140 pieces @ Le35,000, with the balance of Le100,000 used for transport.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":842099,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354924,"comment":null},{"amount":195.84,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":842098.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315575971,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":842099,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322937732,"comment":null},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":833333.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":842099,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070217,"comment":null},{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1684198.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339458600,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-17T02:14:06Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:04:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467810,"name":"Antony","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antony is 49 years old.

They live in the community of Chullpani Grande towards southern Colomi. They know how to read and write. They have two small children, a humble family. Hilarion works in transport service in the Sindicato de Autotransporte Mixto (Mixed Transport Union) with a route from Colomi to Cochabamba to back. They are also farmers. Every year they sell 70 loads of potatoes, 80 loads of hay, 10 of ulluco, 10 of another tuber. Mostly his wife works growing on two hectares of land inherited from her parents. She hires temporary employees for land preparation, planting, cultivation labors, and harvesting. This way, they get economic resources to maintain their family. Hilarion tells us that that he had construction done on the two-story house. They invested all the savings they had but they don't have money for the fine workmanship. With this opportunity, they will have a comfortable home to live more happier with the two children who are still with them."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1229.66,"image":{"id":1170967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She\u2019s married to Rolando who is the father of their two children who are 16 and 6 years old who she wants to provide a better quality of life for.  They all live together in the house they bought with savings they earned over several years of hard work.\r\n\r\nShe sells food (breakfasts, lunches and a-la-carte dishes) in a space she equipped at home.  She also rents out this space for receptions and social events.  She started out more than two years ago making small amounts and gradually increased.  She considers her business to be quite profitable because of the good profits it produces and the demand her dishes have.  \r\n\r\nShe didn\u2019t have any problems before starting the business but she decided to start it anyway in order to have an occupation, to feel productive and become a prosperous, independent businesswoman.  Now, seeing the good results, she plans to expand the space to increase capacity and provide better comfort for her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #4.

They live together in the home that they built, which is a result of much effort and dedication. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling fruit. Everyday she goes out into the city streets, transporting her products in a cart and calling out in her strong voice to her customers, to buy her fruit. She has been selling in this way for a year and she works by herself. When the sun is very strong she sets up a small stand, with a small table under a plastic covering to provide shade, to sell there during the day.  Along with selling fruit, she also works in the evenings selling \"salchipapas\" (french fries and fried sausages) on the sidewalk outside her house. She is a woman who loves her work because it is her only form of income and it allows her to cover the necessary expenses which are demanded by her large family. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan she has taken out through MFP.

51 years old, lives in the village of Mukhiani, West Georgia,with his  two adult daughters (25 and 21 years old) and a son-in-law. His wife Shorena works abroad and transfers part of her income to her family to assist them financially. The main source of family income is a small dairy farm, led by Vazha. He has three milk cows from which he produces cheese to sell in the village to local dairy product retailers. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nVazha has requested a loan from Credo to restart the family business which was stopped recently due to financial problems. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo, whose start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup loans with soft conditions to the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. Indeed, Vazha had requested loans from local financial institutions several times, but was rejected each time due to his low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Vazha will renovate family-owned greenhouses, which aren\u2019t functional now due to a state of disrepair. After renovation Vazha will once more grow vegetables in the greenhouses during the whole year, and consequently the income of the family will significantly increase. It will therefore allow him to provide better living conditions for his family.

She learned how to sell from her mother and started this business with a little income that she got from her saving club. This is her third loan cycle with BRAC Liberia. She has requested another loan to purchase more charcoal for the business and increase her sales. Her plan for the future is to educate her children and build  a house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1184162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more charcoal for the business and increase her sales.

is 27 years old. He lives in the village of Mukhiani, West Georgia with his wife Diana, two children (7 and 6 years old) and his 74-year-old grandmother. Konstantin requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business re-start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected each time because of insufficient income. \r\n\r\nThe main source of income for the family is their small-scale agricultural business, led by Konstantin. He has a small family farm with a milk cow and a pig. Dairy products are mainly consumed by the family members, and a small surplus is sold to local dairy products retailers. Also, Konstantin sells piglets in the village. The total average monthly income of the family is 300 Laris, including the monthly pension of Konstantin\u2019s grandmother. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nKonstantin requested a loan from Credo to re-start the family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. His loan request was approved in the framework of new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit Konstantin will renovate family-owned greenhouses, which aren\u2019t functional now, as they are in bad condition. After renovation Konstantin will re-start to grow vegetables in the greenhouses during whole year and the income of the family will significantly increase. This will allow him to provide better living conditions for the family members. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1184177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase materials for greenhouse renovation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Mukhiani","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2012-09-04T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-04T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Konstantin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.52},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":81.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.18},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89.2},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":97.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.11},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.33,"local_amount":72.52,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308209962,"comment":null},{"amount":579.67,"local_amount":927.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":959.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315440732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-05T00:55:10Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:27:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467828,"name":"Abena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abena  is a fishmonger at Abrofo near Abura.

is 45 years old and comes from San Miguel, Bohol. She is married with two adult sons. She has been cooking and selling peanut rolls (peanut roll is crushed sweetened peanuts that are wrapped in lumpia wrapper and fried) for an income.

This is his story: \"My wife Rosario and I once ran a clothing shop, but financial hardship struck. We were both interested in designing jewelry, and at first we relied on expert silversmiths,\" he said. \"I was fascinated with the process of making jewelry and became an eager student \u2013 I now design and craft my own jewelry.

One of her children is starting seventh grade this year, which is a benchmark year, since most children drop out by the sixth grade, if they make it that far. In fact, Mar\u00eda did not have the opportunity to attend school at all. For several years, Mar\u00eda and her husband have devoted their energy and resources to agricultural activities. They grow vegetables such as carrots, radishes, cabbage, cauliflower, and potatoes on seven acres of land. They sell their products in nearby markets.  Maria also engages in the purchase and resale of vegetables while she is at the market, so that she leverages the use of her time.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is an enterprising, able woman who has designs to grow her economic prospects.  With this loan, she wants to add two new small enterprises: growing flowers and raising chickens.  She intends to use the loan to buy vegetable seeds to augment her current business, flower seeds, and four-dozen chickens. This is what Mar\u00eda says of her loan, \"I am delighted to receive this new loan, and I'm very eager for my two new projects, and my family supports me.\" \r\n\r\nThe 14 women of Mujeres Activas are very active and participatory. They love to participate during the monthly trainings delivered by a Friendship Bridge staff, where they discuss topics such as women's health, hygiene, children's rights, self-esteem, business administration, and money administration, among others. The Mujers Activas group is thankful for the support that the Kiva investors provide for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5200,"image":{"id":1184349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

Todo esto hizo que fuera muy dif\u00edcil estudiar en una de las universidades m\u00e1s exigentes en el \u00e1rea de Ingenier\u00eda de Colombia, la Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS).\n\nEn un viaje con su equipo de f\u00fatbol se dio cuenta que lo que m\u00e1s quer\u00eda en su vida era dedicarse a la ingenier\u00eda y sacar buenas notas en su carrera. En sus \u00faltimos semestres de carrera fue de los mejores alumnos de su clase. Adem\u00e1s, obtuvo una tesis honor\u00edfica en sus estudios sobre Bioingenier\u00eda sobre se\u00f1ales el\u00e9ctricas cardiacas. \n\nAhora Juan Guillermo tiene el sue\u00f1o de realizar una maestr\u00eda en ingenier\u00eda electr\u00f3nica e innovaci\u00f3n en Francia y necesita el apoyo de Kiva para poder financiar los gastos de preparaci\u00f3n de ex\u00e1menes de idioma e inscripci\u00f3n a estos mismos ya que no tiene otra forma de pagarlos.\n\nAqu\u00ed esta su historia:\n\nEl prop\u00f3sito de la vida es el constante crecimiento, creo que como seres humanos estamos en continuo aprendizaje y cada vivencia trae consigo una ense\u00f1anza.\n\nEn mi caso quiero cada d\u00eda crecer m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s,  y el estudio es la base de ello. Una formaci\u00f3n superior en el extranjero catalizar\u00eda mi crecimiento acad\u00e9mico y personal.

Innovaci\u00f3n, estrategia y emprendimiento serian las herramientas que me permitir\u00edan actuar en el escenario anteriormente mencionado.

He had the dream of being a professional soccer player one day, and he spent a lot of time and effort in the trainings and competitions.  All of this made it very difficult to study at one of the most demanding universities in the area of Engineering in Colombia, the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS).\r\n\r\nOn a trip with his soccer team he realized that what he wanted most in life was to devote himself to engineering and to get good grades in his courses.  In the last semesters of the courses for his degree he was among the best students in his class.  Also, he obtained honors for his thesis in his studies of Bioengineering about electrical cardiac signals.\r\n\r\nNow Juan Guillermo dreams of getting his Master\u2019s in Innovation Electrical Engineering in France.  He needs support from Kiva to be able to pay the expenses for enrollment and preparation for the language exams.  He does not have any other way of paying for them.\r\n\r\nHere is his story:\r\n\r\nLife\u2019s purpose is constant growth.  I believe that as human beings we are continually learning, and each experience brings with it a lesson.  In my case, I want to grow more and more each day.  Studying is the foundation for this.  Post graduate studies abroad will serve as a catalyst for my academic and personal growth.  It would prepare my mind to receive new ideas, and it would promote an intercultural exchange between people.  It would provide me with an important academic background.  These are meaningful reasons to wish to study in another country.\r\n\r\nNowadays the need arises to change things when they take an undesirable turn.  Any process has inevitable modifications; that is true.  However, I personally believe that what is most called for would be to turn them around at the time they happen.  Innovation, strategy, and entrepreneurship would be the tools that would allow me to act in the previously mentioned scenario.  Knowing each detail in depth, with numerous tools abroad, allows me to apply this in my country.  This is my aspiration in that regard.\r\n\r\nWith the above permitting, I see myself in the future returning to my country, generating new projects, and looking for solutions to diverse engineering problems.  The most import thing is developing ideas about sustainability in a territory that is rich in resources that are not renewable.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that I found a job in June, it would take me at least 15 months of savings, calculating that I can save 65 thousand pesos ($30 US) a month.  The Kiva program would help me in the process of studying outside of Colombia.  It would activate my project logistically and financially in order to be able to fulfill that which I have dreamed.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":108.33,"image":{"id":1187202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses to study for a Master's Degree in  Innovation Technology and Entrepreneurship.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bucaramanga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-05T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-05T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":96666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":98691.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042082,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":96666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":98691.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-05T07:40:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":467903,"name":"Hannah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah lives in West Point.

Three of her children are still in school, while the remaining five children are working for others for a fee. \r\n\r\nTo overcome the family's financial burden to support her household, she makes a living from catching fishes; it is the business that she has been with for 35 years.

They are all friends and acquaintances, and they are responsible women who are struggling each day to provide for their families.  Most of the women work in agriculture, livestock production and retail trade.  Cumbe parish has a cold climate, and its architecture is a mix of colonial and modern styles.  There are a lot of places where one can enjoy nature.  Many of the residents work in the city or have migrated from different parts of the world in order to carry out activities that will allow them to improve the financial situation of their households.  In spite of all of this, they still maintain their culture and the traditions of their towns.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Bernardita.  She has been a member of the communal bank \"La Gran Amistad\" for a year.  Bernardita is a native of Nabon, but for work reasons and for her children's education she's been living in Paccha province for 8 years.  Every 28 days, she travels to Cumbe parish in Cuenca to meet with her communal bank and see her friends.  She is 51 years old and is married.  Together with her husband, she has 12 children: 7 of her children are married and live independently, and her 5 unmarried children are 17, 15, 14, 10 and 8 years of age.  Two of her children are in school, and one child is disabled and so stays in the home.  The two youngest study at a little school in the town. Her husband works as a bricklayer.  In her canton, she has her own house, but in Paccha province they live in a rented home.\r\n\r\nBernardita has a business raising guinea pigs and hens, because she doesn't have a lot of space to raise animals.  But in Nabon canton, she cultivates her land and she uses part of her harvest for her family's consumption, and sells the rest.
