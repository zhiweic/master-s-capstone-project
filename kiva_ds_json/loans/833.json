by her love of New Orleans and the French Quarter, Cynthia started Sugar Cane New Orleans Molasses Bakery, LLC.  Using only quality ingredients, she hopes to sell her cookies wholesale to many of the local retailers in the French Quarter.  \r\n\r\nAfter Hurricane Katrina required the office that she worked in to relocate to the French Quarter, Cynthia had an opportunity to rediscover the city's famous cornerstone neighborhood.  Exploring the French Quarter on her lunch breaks, Cynthia, a New Orleans native, fell in love with the city all over again.  Wanting to start a business that celebrated the food and history of this unique city, she created the \"NOMO\" cookie.  A certified product of Louisiana, these New Orleans Molasses (NOMO) cookies are made with Steen's sugar cane syrup and each cookie is pressed with a vintage 18th century Louisiana antique mold.  The NOMO cookie is representative of the city and history that inspired it and the love that Cynthia has for creating them. \r\n\r\nAfter being unsuccessful in finding other options to fund her business, Cynthia turned to Kiva to help her grow her business.  With her Kiva loan Cynthia will purchase a professional dough sheeter that will allow her to create a consistent product.   \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva New Orleans and in partnership with Good Work Network and ASI Federal Credit Union. Kiva New Orleans is a part of Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans.

has been doing entrepreneurial freelance graphic design work for close to nine years. He gained experience in graphic design while still living in the Dominican Republic and continued to do this work after moving to the United States. Overall, he has acquired over 24 years of experience in this field. Just recently, he decided to take the final step in becoming self-reliant by incorporating his freelance work into a formal business. \r\n\r\nLast month, Luis founded a self-titled company that does all of the graphic design and printing work for books, brochures, letterheads, and more for clients that do not have the means to do this themselves. He is also still working part-time for a larger company, but has aspirations of making this business his sole means of income soon. Luis plans to use this loan to buy a new printer to maximize his output. He also would like to buy parts to repair some of his older equipment to make his business more

Her husband works at a factory in Manta.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good homemaker who carries out several activities in order to earn an income and contribute to the household expenses.  She sells all kinds of clothing and costume jewellery on a door-to-door basis.  She also raises chickens at home where she has a small coop for this purpose.  When the chickens are fully grown she sells them to merchants.  She works three days a week, especially at night when her husband comes home from work and takes care of the children.  Her sales are made on a credit basis; and she collects payment every weekend.  When she is in need of merchandise, she travels to Portoviejo to buy it.  She started up her business with her first loan through the communal bank.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more merchandise such as trousers, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing.  She has been a member of the communal bank since it began, and likes it because thanks to her first loan she was able to start her business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own house, since she now lives with her mother.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":927925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy trousers, blouses, t-shirts and children's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-04-17T09:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-17T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayda Merelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":797.5,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":99.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":99.69,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646341,"comment":null},{"amount":300.01,"local_amount":299.07,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":300.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321420,"comment":null},{"amount":200.01,"local_amount":199.38,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":200.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287209017,"comment":null},{"amount":199.98,"local_amount":199.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":199.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335332,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-17T15:07:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":412105,"name":"Mayra Janeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Mar\u00eda Inmaculada se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas  en La parroquia La Sequita de Montecristi, cant\u00f3n conocido por los famosos sombreros de paja toquilla que son apreciados dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Mayra, tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen dos hijos de  tres y un a\u00f1os de edad.

In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business in animal husbandry in 1998 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Nazgul's persistent and hard work, today her business yields about 15,000 som (KGS) in monthly profit from sales of milk and meat products.  In order to further develop her business, Nazgul requested a loan in the amount of 55,000 som (KGS) to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.

Today her business contains three dairy cows, ten sheep, three horses, and the earnings from the sale of milk allow her to cover the family's daily expenses.  In order to further develop her business, Klara requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional heads of livestock.

To provide a primary source of income for her family, Natalya, a trained pastry chef, has been involved in selling baked goods and food products since 2000, having started this business with an initial sum of 1,000 som (KGS).  Her family is also involved in beekeeping, selling honey to the local residents during the season.  Today, Natalya's business yields about 40,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Natalya requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan partially into repairing her house and then into an opening of her own

Yura also owns agricultural machinery: a tractor and a press for packing hay into bales.  Yura provides paid services with the help of this machinery in the villages of the Syunik region.  This fact allows Yura to make a good profit during the agricultural season, which lasts from June through September.\r\nYura is 48 years old, married and has two children: a son and a daughter.  Yura's daughter lives with her own family separately from the parents.  Yura's son is married, and he and his family live together with the parents.  Currently, Yura's son is in Russia.  Yura's wife helps her husband with the agricultural business, and thanks to their business, they support the family.  Yura needs a loan in the amount of 400,000 dram to purchase a reaping machine and repair his tractor.  Purchasing a reaping machine would allow Yura to increase his family's

She had the inclination for assembling crafts with hardware, making silver accessories, an activity that she learned in a workshop near her home, where she helped a neighbor that worked in silver.\r\n\r\nThrough some visual media she learned about the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and became interested in its training program for entrepreneurs and later she applied for loans with which she bought her rolling mill, with which she gradually became independent. Little by little she was thinking of diversifying her products. She bought four display cases, one motor toll, one drill press, welding equipment and also added various merchandise changing her business into a general store as she is functioning today. She is helped in her business by her sister, a friend, and her husband, who sells the items she makes. In her business she sells by credit and cash. Her customers come to her business to buy miscellaneous items and she has enough space in her house to display her work.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her seventh loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy miscellaneous items such as clothing, accessories, school supplies, lacework, and merchandise that she sells from her catalog. She had successful business and personal growth with her previous loans as she herself believes. Her dream going forward is to have her own house, with adequate facilities for her business before setting it up and thus giving the best comfort to her customers, herself and her family, therefore it becomes her main challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1064588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy miscellaneous items such as clothing, accessories, school supplies, lacework, and merchandise that she offers from her catalog","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-04-18T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-18T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68009},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":69596},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71220},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72882},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":74582},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76322},{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78103},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":79926},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":81791},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83699},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":85652},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":87651},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":89696},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91789},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":93930},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96122},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98365},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.54},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":414245,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a married woman who lives in a rental house that has electricity and piped water.
