From a young age she has always had financial difficulties, but even so she has always fought to get ahead in life.  Her mother always instilled in her a love for school and the desire to be successful, and she has taught her how important school is to being able to achieve a good future and a better quality of life.  She attended elementary school with many sacrifices because they had to pay a tuition, and then when she went to high school she had to care for her younger siblings on the weekends so her mom could work.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was young she had a bitter experience with some relatives. When she finished elementary school they offered to help her with high school and college.  In view of this good opportunity, when she was only 10 years old, she accepted what she thought was an excellent opportunity, but with time and after many humiliations and bad treatment, and although she graduated from high school, she understood that it had been a mistake and later decided to go back to her parents and her siblings because she was no longer willing to endure more abuse.\r\n\r\nLater she tried to find opportunities to study, but it seemed that every time she tried to search something intervened; it was almost impossible.  If the majority of times it was not for money that she did not have for the application form or things like that, then it was for some other requirement; at times they gave her options for credits or loans but she did not have someone to serve as a guarantor.\r\n\r\nNow she is a single mother of two beautiful girls, and she tries to fight to offer them a better future since she dreams of giving them a good education and a good opportunity to take them to college because, although they are young now, one wants to be a doctor and the other an anthropologist. \r\n\r\nAt this time she is attending the second semester of financial accounting and it has been difficult; she is not sure whether for lack of studying or lack of experience.  In addition, she has not been able to find stable employment.  Therefore she has had to take whatever work comes along, as the expression goes; she has been working as a domestic employee, an assistant in the kitchen, and an assistant along the school route.  She is always trying to fulfill her obligations and the expenses of her daughters (the rent, monthly payment for kindergarten, food, clothing, shoes, utilities, health, and semester fees)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1340347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"To finish her studies in financial accounting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":"2013-04-28T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-28T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enyi Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":138001.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372891055,"comment":null},{"amount":5.77,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":10615.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391557682,"comment":null},{"amount":80.77,"local_amount":140000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":148617.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399780610,"comment":null},{"amount":63.46,"local_amount":110000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116770.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429845842,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-28T19:48:06Z","paid_date":"2013-12-31T09:44:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554130,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vicente es un se\u00f1or de 61 a\u00f1os quien tiene 9 hijos 6 mujeres y 3 hombres quienes viven en Solol\u00e1.\nEl  se dedica a la agricultura desde hace 40 a\u00f1os, eligi\u00f3 esta actividad por que se trabaja por temporada ya que se obtienen ingresos aceptables por cada cultivo.

La se\u00f1ora Apolonia argumenta \"Tuve que cerrar el negocio porque en ese tiempo todas mis hijas estudiaban y no nos alcanzaba para seguir invirtiendole a la tienda de abarrotes\" Pero Do\u00f1a Apolonia esta muy contenta porque gracias al prestamo de Vision Fund y KIVA podra tener nuevamente su tienda de abarrotes.El sue\u00f1o de Do\u00f1a Apolonia es volver a tener su tiendita de abarrotes como lo tenia anteriormente y no tener preocupaciones economicas mas adelante.","en":"The group \u201cCapulines\u201d is located in a remote area and you must go on foot as there is no transportation. It is a large community where the people grow corn. They chose their name because the place where they meet has many  capulines (a type of cherry). They are a small group but the people take advantage to do big things such as making capuline atole (a corn-based drink) and capuline tamales. The group Capulines is made up of five women and one man. They are very responsible and above all very hardworking. \r\n\r\nThe members are seeking a loan from the institution in order to invest it in their economic activities such as Sabina who will buy food for her pigs for breeding and fattening the animals. Esperanza will buy sheep for breeding and fattening. Teresa will buy supplies for her cybercafe. Raul will use his loan to supply his grocery store. Viviana will invest in costume jewelry.\r\n\r\nApolonia who is also a part of the mentioned group is 58 years old. She is a  widow who has lived all her life in the community. Apolonia says that she wants to reopen her grocery store as she learned this financial activity from her parents who were engaged in selling groceries. She has a son in the United States who sent her a little money to open her grocery store but not enough and that is why she is asking for a loan in order to buy sugar, salt, soft drinks, eggs, milk, detergents, canned food, etc. Apolonia reasons that, \u201cI had to close the business because at that time all my daughters studied and I could not come up with enough to keep investing in the grocery store.\u201d But Apolonia is very happy because thanks to the loan from Vision Fund and Kiva she can once again have her grocery store. Apolonia\u2019s dream is that her small store is like it used to be before and that she does not have future financial concerns.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":1338842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

age 54, is a farmer. He is an IDP (internally displaced person) and lives with his wife and son in the Bilasuvar IDP Settlement. He has been raising seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 10 years. He chose this business because it is profitable and because there is always a high demand for fresh crops. People use fresh vegetables every day and include them in many national dishes, such as pilau and dolma. Fresh fruits are served at every family table in Azerbaijan and are often made into fresh punch.  \r\n\r\nRashid sells his crops in the BIlasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 100 AZN. His wife actively helps him to raise his crops.

He also sells milk and yogurt to his neighbors. Milk and meat sales bring him an income of 100 AZN per month. Milk, yogurt, and meat are all very popular products in Azerbaijan. People use meat in such everyday national dishes as pilau and dolma, and most people usually serve yogurt sauce with their meals. Milk products are considered very healthy and are consumed daily.\r\n\r\nThis is the only source of financial income for the family, and Husan reports that it is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children.

She tells us that she has worked selling Mexican corn-based dishes for more than four years. She started working in her own business because she wanted to work to move forward. Since she knows how to cook well, she decided to start selling food and her business took off. Today, she continues with her business. She sells from her home on weekends (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) in the evening. Sometimes she sells food on other occasions and earns some extra money. \"I like to be on the move.

They named their group \"El Fresno de la Soledad\" [\"The Ash of Solitude\"] because where they were meeting, there was a big ash tree, and to locate the group quickly, they gave it that name. She says that she is sad right now because her father-in-law is very ill. He was a member of the group and a very hardworking gentleman; now his health is very delicate, so she is taking care of him. \r\n\r\nFrancisca earns her living growing avocados. Where she lives, she has a big field where she grows corn, marigolds, peaches, a stubble crop, etc. She says that she has the field divided in half; in one half she has the avocado orchard, and in the other half, she grows the other crops. She is requesting a loan because she wants to buy fertilizers and insecticides to strengthen her avocado trees; she has small fruit right now, and to keep them from falling off, she needs to apply these materials. She says that she has 180 trees and she and her husband take care fo them because they hope to one day leave them to their children as an inheritance.\r\n\r\nShe says that Vision Fund has made several loans to her and that she has paid all of them back well, and that thanks to those loans, she has been able to make her farm grow. She says that with the profits that she will earn from her avocado crop, she is planning to buy a higher-capacity pump to water her trees.

So he is requesting a loan of 6,600,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, cement, and gypsum. Using these materials, he can complete the house-building work and provide his family members with comfortable and warm accommodations.

He lives in the small village of Samtredia District with his wife, son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. Merab requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his family's business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have four milking cows and two calves, whose milk is used in cheese production. Besides that, they have a vineyard and 500 nut trees. They sell the harvested products and cheese at local markets. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMerab requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. His loan request was approved in the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Merab will open a car wash. He will purchase all the needed equipment for it and will work hard to increase the income of the family. Merab hopes that the car wash will be profitable and he will do his best to satisfy his clients. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

In particular, they have 4 milking cows, whose milk is used in cheese production. They sell cheese at local markets. Besides, they have 0.8 hectare of agricultural land.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nRamin requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Ramin has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Ramin will purchase a minibus. After purchasing a minibus, he will gather scrap iron from his village and then he will deliver it and earn money from it at the scrapyard. This will increase the income of his family.

Her loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nThe family owns a vineyard. With the harvested grapes they make wine and vodka. The products are sold locally at the markets. They also have a horse which is rented out seasonally for a small income. Additional income for the family comes from Lela\u2019s mother in-law\u2019s monthly pension. \r\nLela requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Lela has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit Lela will start trading with fruits and vegetables. She will purchase a car and agricultural products from the reseller in Gurjaani district, bring the products to the capital city of Georgia, Tbilisi, and sell at the local market.  Part of the profit Lela will use for reinvesting in the same business and develop her trading. Another part she will use for the family.

She earns 8,000 INR per month from this activity, which is not sufficient for her family to survive on. \r\n\r\nShe wants to enlarge her business by taking orders in bulk from her customers and fulfilling their demands on time. She wants to purchase new and advanced tools for making furniture and some wooden logs to prepare ready-made furniture like small tables, coffee tables, etc.\r\n\r\nTikan, along with her group, has applied for the loan amount of 275,000 INR. She has a plan to use her portion of the loan for purchasing the above items. She says that by doing so, her family's monthly income will increase and she will be able to give her family a good living standard.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1340072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to pay for purchasing wooden logs and some new and advanced tools for her furniture shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Balipatna, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2013-04-29T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-29T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":5075,"lender_count":148,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tikan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khulana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ullasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhoi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ranjana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Swarnaprava ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhaila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Golap ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sodari ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sajani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":275000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":5075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":275000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-30T00:13:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":553489,"name":"Ayaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayaz is 39 years old and single.

is married and has three children. She has received schooling through basic level to middle school level. Mercy is a petty trader as well as a food vendor who prepares and sells banku at Akpafu, Hohoe. She has done this for the past 16 years to support herself and her family. To prepare banku, she first prepares corn dough (maize that has been milled and left for a day) and cassava dough. She mixes the cassava and corn dough and cooks them into a porridge-like consistency form. To get the right consistency, she has to stir the mixture on a hot firewood stove. The texture of banku has to be fine, but firm. The accompanying dish can either be any kind of soup or sauce such as palm nut soup, groundnut soup or peanut soup, okra soup, or hot pepper sauce with fish of any kind.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a farmer. Mercy uses her income to help her husband with the general upkeep of the home, as well as to support extended family members. Mercy will use the loan to purchase bags of cassava dough, palm fruits, a bag of rice, a gallon of oil, and a bag of onions. With the new profits from her expanded business, Mercy plans to save and increase her working capital so she can operate a bigger chop bar in the near future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1340425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to

This is the only source of income for the family, and it is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the subsistence poverty category. \r\n\r\nNino has requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Nino has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people and those who do not have access to credit. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Nino will buy bed clothes to sell.

38-year-old Isatu from Port Loko in the Northern area in Freetown. She is married with four children between the ages of 8 and 18. Her children are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Isatu established her salon business. She began her business because, after she graduated from a vocational training school, she decided to start her business to create income, to support her family. She works at the business based on customers' demand. At present, she describes her major problem to be inadequate material available to use in the salon when customers want to do a certain style.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to buy more varieties of hair and hair cream to expand her salon. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to expand her business and pay fees for her children. In the future, she plans to open a permanent business site. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375.57,"image":{"id":1340467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

operates a local chop bar at Hohoe lorry station. She cooks and sells banku and fufu, local Ghanaian dishes. In Ghana, fufu is mostly made from boiled cassava and unripe plantain beaten together. Fufu (also known as foofoo or foufou) is a thick paste usually made by boiling starchy root vegetables in water and pounding with a mortar and pestle until the desired consistency is reached. The malleable dough is served and eaten with a light tomato soup, groundnut soup, palm oil fruit soup or other soups. Banku\/Akple is fermented corn\/cassava dough mixed proportionally and cooked in hot water into a smooth whitish consistent paste. Served with soup, stew or a pepper sauce with fish. The most popular side dish for banku in Ghana is okra stew.  \r\n\r\nVivian is single but has 3 children. She has been in business for the past 9 years.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nCristita operates a meat stall. She buys slaughtered hogs, cuts them into smaller portions, then sells them per kilo. There are many patrons who prefer her products since they are assured of their freshness and cleanliness. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales, every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional supplies of pork, needed in her business. \r\n\r\nCristita dreams to expand her business and have her own stall in the market. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation Credit Cooperative (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

has been in the lawn care business since the age of 7.

He believes he\u2019s not better than others, but is serious about offering good service, affordable prices and quality care. He was born in Bay City, Texas, but moved  as a young adult to Houston, where he mastered the art of sales.  He later relocated to Hitchcock, in Galveston County, not far from where he grew up. \r\n\r\nDandra was referred to Accion Texas through the Small Business Development Center at the University of Houston.  His $5,450 equipment and supply loan will allow him to purchase fertilizers, lawn mowers and gardening tools, and pay employees.  This will allow him to take on more customers and finish more jobs efficiently and expand his services.  He currently employs three full-time people and says the expansion will allow him to hire more in the near future.
