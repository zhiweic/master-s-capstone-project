With the help of her family members she is involved in the cultivation of potatoes, beets, greens, and strawberries. Karine\u2019s son sells the agricultural products at the local market, which is the main source of the family\u2019s income. As life is getting more expensive day by day Karine wants to expand her agribusiness to be able to more effectively cover the family\u2019s expenses. She currently needs to make some investments to the agribusiness to reach her goal.

To reach that goal Naira needs to make some investments. She needs a loan of 3,000 USD to purchase necessary materials (cellophane, bottles) for greenhouse construction, to buy fertilizers, and to purchase cucumber seeds. Naira and her family rely on the goodwill of the lenders and will appreciate their support in collecting the needed loan amount to sustain their agribusiness.

In this special loan, Hipolito is representing his church from the community of Los Minas from the east of Santo Domingo. The church, called Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal MI Church, started a water project three years ago, in order to provide purified water to their community inhabitants, giving the service at a low price but with a high quality and the proper standards.\r\n\r\nWith this loan they will invest in a truck, five-gallon bottles, some equipment and will improve their distribution point (where they sterilize gallons, fill bottles with purified water and deliver them to the neighbors that go directly to the business to buy them or sellers that distribute them). By \"improve,\" they mean to buy five-gallon water bottles and labels, change system pieces, paint walls and other investments.\r\n\r\nHipolito is the pastor in this church and also is in change of the water project called Agua Betesda (Water Betesda). In their neighborhood live around 30,000 people, and their plan is to distribute purified water to 50% of the inhabitants at a cost of $0.50 for a five-gallon bottle of water. With this, Hipolito said, they want to impact different economic, health and spiritual areas and many others. This community is an extremely poor area in Santo Domingo with many salubrity problems, potable water scarcity, diseases, pollution, etc. and with programs like this, the community could start changing their lives. This church is committed to start as many projects as they can to contribute to the development of this community.\r\n\r\nHipolito thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity.

By character, Bubira is kind, responsive and hardworking. Her husband is working abroad in Russia. Bubira resides with her in-laws. They respond very well to their daughter-in-law. Bubira has a secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, Bubira is involved with crop cultivation and raising livestock, having begun two years ago with a sum of 15,000 som KGS. \r\n\r\nThanks to the hard work of Bubira and her family, they currently have on their homestead: two dairy cows, arable land measuring 2.10 hectares, and also they rent around 3.0 hectares of land to fellow villagers. On her fruitful share of land, Bubira grows many types of vegetables for sale, such as: potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbes, corn, and watermelons. The earth is continually re-worked, therefore the harvest is always good. Bubira's crop is sold to wholesalers. Monthly income amounts to 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the aim of additional development of her homestead, Bubira turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan - to purchase bulls for fattening and breeding. Bubira knows the specifics of animal husbandry, therefore she plans to breed cattle. \r\n\r\nBubira plans to invest income from the loan in further propagation of the count of domestic animals, and intends to save money to support her son with all the necessities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

outgoing woman of 40 years. She lives with her family in a rural village. Since childhood, Dilafruz has had the desire to learn to cook different dishes. She learned a lot from her mother. Today this experience helps her to earn a living. In order to have an income for her family, she engages in her own business. Dilafruz sells various salads and pickles, which she prepares herself. She has been engaged in this work for three years. \r\n\r\nShe is a repeat client of Arvand. Her first loan was received in order to start a business. Now, Dilafruz needs to purchase more products and different spices to prepare another batch of salads for sale. For this, she has once again appealed to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy products and spices. Dilafruz needs a positive result and thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1499898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He taught himself the ranching business by selling cattle. Juan also earns income as a day laborer, which he does during the seasons where he does not have his own work to do. His job is located 4 kilometers away, and he works for 9 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting will be used to pay rent on the land where he grows corn and beans. He will also use it to clear and plow the land. The loan will help him to secure the land where he will grow his crops in the upcoming season. He will be able to have a place to continue growing crops to sustain his family so that he can assure that his family will have the proper nutrition.\r\n\r\nHis dream for his business is to one day purchase his own land on which to grow crops. So far, he has needed to rent land to farm. Now, he has a dream for his family, which is for his children to go to college, graduate, and become what they want to be.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1512640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to rent the land where he grows corn and beans, and to clear and plow the land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T16:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T16:10:12Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-17T17:11:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658265,"name":"Ana Dermidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, es abogado y notario,  est\u00e1 casada desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, el esposo es comerciante.

Then one day she decided to buy basic products to sell, and this was how she set up her sales stand. Her business is close to her house - she just has to walk 2 blocks to get there. Three times a week she goes to the city 35 km away to buy goods and bring them home. When she can't be at her business her sister also helps her. Yeny works 12 horas a day from Monday to Sunday.<br \/><br \/>With the loan Yeny intends to buy basic goods for sale such as soap, detergent, toilet paper, rice and beans. The loan will improve her life because she will have the opportunity to sell more and to be able to meet her son's needs and as well as covering basic household requirements in a timely fashion. There is a need to satisfy demand in the community and grow her business. Her dream is to expand her business by purchasing new products for sale that people need. She wants to see her family get ahead by using effort and hard work, as this is the only way.

She has had success in her sales thus far and takes pride in empowering the women who purchase her products. By hosting \u201cskincare parties\u201d throughout the area, Amanda is able to attract new clients, while bringing women together in a relaxed setting. \r\n\r\nAmanda will use her $800 Kiva loan to purchase inventory for her skincare line.

Two of her siblings emigrated to the US due to the impoverished situation the family was in. As Dolores was not able to study, she had decided to go into business from a very young age so that she could provide for her family. She is a single mother with two children who are studying.\r\n \r\nShe does housework and helps her brother to grow corn and beans.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay County is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

His wife sometimes helps him with his business, but spends most of her time doing housework.  They have a 5 year old daughter who is not yet in school.  Juan live with his whole family (parents, brothers) on the same land but in different houses.  Only his wife and daughter depend on him.  \r\n\r\nFrom a young age, Juan has worked selling clothing door-to-door.  He learned this trade from his mother, who still works in this field.  He sells his merchandise in the town that he lives in, as well as in four neighboring towns.  He travels by bus to buy and sell his products.  With the support of his wife and one of his brothers, he works every day from 6 am to 3 pm.  \r\n\r\nHe will use part of the loan to pay off a loan that he has with a bank, for which he believes he is being charged an interest rate that is too high.  The rest of the loan will be used to purchase more merchandise for his business (all types of clothing for children and adults).  The loan will be very helpful because it will allow him to save money and invest it in his daughter.  \r\n\r\nHis goal is to give his family a better home, as the one they currently live in has sheet metal walls.  Everyday, he buys materials such as bricks, iron, sand, etc. so that little by little he can accumulate the materials he needs to build a house.  He also wants his daughter to be a professional, he dreams of seeing her work in an office, not like him, selling in the streets of their town.

Homa Bay County is located in southwestern Kenya, close to both the Tanzanian border and Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake. Despite the proximity to the lake, water infrastructure in Homa Bay remains quite undeveloped, and inconsistent rains and occasional droughts make life difficult for farmers in the area. Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts, and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nRose is widowed and has six children. She works as a community health worker and a primary teacher in school, as well as working on projects on her land. She grows maize, beans, amaranth, and sunflower, rears dairy goats and cows, and also keeps her own bees. Lastly, she does \"green banking,\" which involves bulking up cereals during harvest when the price is low and selling them when the prices goes up. She likes beekeeping because it is easy compared to other types of farming, requires relatively little capital, and encourages conservation of the environment. \r\n\r\nThis is Rose\u2019s first loan, and she plans to use the income from her beehives to pay her children\u2019s school fees and invest in agribusinesses.

What she most likes about her work is the flow of customers into her store, whom she waits on with great friendliness. \r\n\r\nIn this opportunity she is seeking S\/.800 [800 PEN], and she is very happy knowing that she has the financial support that assures that she can continue working with peace of mind.  She promises to continue being a member who is punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she has requested, she will purchase some components and replacement parts for 3 televisions that she will send out for repair. She will also get new video games to continue growing her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1512631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","use":"to purchase components, replacement parts and new video games.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marvel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":127.71},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":132.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":133.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":142.39},{"due_date":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.39},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T02:23:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658467,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 33 years old, married to Judy and together they are blessed with a 12-year-old child.\r\n\r\nHe has a hotel in Naivasha where he has specialized in selling delicious soup.

Zina has secondary education. She always strives to live life well and she is very positive. She knows exactly what she wants and applies all her strength towards it. <br \/><br \/>As a main income for her family, Zina works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 44 years ago with the purchase of 1,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zina's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows, one horse and 30 sheep. She also has her own plot of land, on which she grows hay and clover for livestock consumption. She harvests the hay and fodder for her livestock from her land allotment, and currently it is in sufficient quantities for her.

up in the capital of Tajikistan. She is a fourth year student in the correspondence department of the Tajik Technical University. She pays for her studies. Ganjina lives with her mother, sister and brother. Ganjina's mother is a housewife, and the three children are all students. Ganjina's father, who lived separately from them but always supported the family morally and materially, unfortunately died in 2012. <br \/><br \/>Ganjina and her sister started working in parallel with the studies, as they both have to pay for their studies. Ganjina works for a company which is one of the leading producers of ice cream, cakes and more than 20 types of confectionery. She works as an overseer of the production of ice cream and cakes.

","en":"Laura Alejandra is 16 years old and is taking a Legal program at CampoAlto. She is in her second semester and it has been a marvelous experience for her and her mother, Jenny, who is the engine of her life. She would like to be an officer of the Colombian army because she has realized that in Colombia they value war more than freedom and peace.  She also states that she would like to do social work so she can help needy children in regions where there is armed conflict. Earning a Legal certificate is essential for Laura because it is an important step in realizing her dream. She is passionate about and is doing very well at criminal and constitutional law, two subjects that are covered at CampoAlto. In addition, Laura has another certificate in Marketing and Sales which she earned at Nazaret Technical Institute under SENA. She says that CampoAlto is a welcoming place because the students progress and have a promising future. There are many program options but most of all it opens up a big pathway to the future labor market. \r\n\r\nHer mother is the one who supported her throughout her life and has told her that getting an education is more important than anything else because without that you can not accomplish anything. Laura is very happy because she has started 11th grade and will soon complete an important step. She is preparing for her big dream - she wants to study English, get her driver's license, and finish her Legal certificate. She dreams of retiring from the army and having financial stability.  In the future she hopes to have a foundation for children with limited resources and from families with mothers as the head of household.  She loves animals.  She dreams of providing her mother with everything she deserves. \r\n\r\nThis young lady is a hard-working person who likes to study, gets good grades and has a great character and personality, and with effort and love she will come out ahead. Nothing is an obstacle for her.  She is grateful for all her blessings and thanks to that she will be successful.

Nonetheless, farmers have adapted to these challenges, particularly by diversifying their crops to include cassava, sunflower, sorghum, bananas, groundnuts and millet, as well as drought-resistant varieties of papaya and mangoes. Although beekeeping has not traditionally been practiced in the region, many individuals have expressed interest in keeping bees and are knowledgeable about their pollination benefits. \r\n\r\nMaria is married, and has ten children.

She likes beekeeping because it is a \"low-labour\" business that still provides good returns. \r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to pay school fees and increase sunflower farming. Her dream for the future is to save enough to make improvements to her house. She would like to thank Kiva lenders \u201cfor this loan which is not like other loans. It suits us well.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

tiempo que tiene de dedicarse propiamente al servicio de mec\u00e1nica, porque lo hace de peque\u00f1o, lo aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres y le gusto por lo que sigue trabajando en lo mismo, tambi\u00e9n hace trabajos de estructuras met\u00e1licas, como hacer puertas, ventanas, poner techos en viviendas, etc. el trabajo lo hace en su casa y  busca personas para que le ayuden, lo hace sin pensar en tiempo, porque cree que el hecho que lo busquen a trabajar es una bendici\u00f3n. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo que esta solicitando, es para arreglar los papeles de un veh\u00edculo, debido a que lo compro y la persona que era antes due\u00f1a falleci\u00f3, por lo que se le ha hecho dif\u00edcil, por el gasto en el que incurrir\u00e1 y actualmente le costar\u00eda reunir el dinero, el cr\u00e9dito le ayudara a mejorar debido a que genere mejores ingresos pues en ocasiones lo han buscado para hacer algunos viajes de le\u00f1a o otro tipo de materiales y no lo ha hecho por miedo a que se lo decomisen las autoridades.\n\nCon el negocio piensa seguir trabajando igual, trabajando para el sustento diario y quiere que si un d\u00eda le falta la vida no dejarles problemas m\u00e1s grandes por el veh\u00edculo a sus hijos. Con el pr\u00e9stamo, lograra solucionar el problema de los papeles, las ganancias del cr\u00e9dito las utilizara para pagar una cuota de un cr\u00e9dito de una de sus hijas que viajo a los estados unidos, la cual no le ayudo a pagarlo estando alla.  \n\n","en":"Miguel is 70 years old and has a spouse.  His wife has a store where she spends her time selling.  Their children don't live at home anymore as they have their own families. A foster child and two granddaughters live with him, but only his wife is dependent on him even though she has her own business. Miguel doesn't remember exactly how long he has been working as a mechanic because he has been doing it since he was young.  He learned the skill from his parents, liked it and stayed with it. He also works on metal structures such as making doors, windows, putting roofs on houses, etc. He does the work from home and looks for people to help him. He is never concerned about the time he spends because he thinks it is blessing enough that people seek his services. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting is to take care of the paperwork for a vehicle, which, due to the fact that the previous owner passed away, is causing difficulties and incurring expenses. It is hard for him to scrape together the money he needs at this time.  The loan will help him to increase his income and improve his finances; on occasion he has been asked to transport wood or other kinds of materials but he hasn't done it for fear that the authorities will confiscate the vehicle. He plans on continuing with his business as before, working to meet his daily needs. He wants to resolve the issue with the vehicle so that if one day he loses his life he won't be leaving bigger problems for his children. With the loan he will be able to solve the problem with the paperwork and he will use the extra money to make a payment on a loan taken out by one of his daughters who traveled to the US and who has not helped with the payments since she has been there.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1512675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to take care of the paperwork for a vehicle, due to the fact that he bought it and then the previous owner passed away","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad Barrios","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel \u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2014-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2014-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.24},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658473,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles is a 52-year-old married man.

Her husband is a fisherman. \r\n\r\nOur friend is a wonderful homemaker who is taking out the loan so that her husband can use it in his work. He has a boat that he uses for fishing. He goes out to sea with his sons in their small boat to fish. They go out for three or four days. They go out with a larger fishing boat to which they turn in their daily catch. After fishing for a few days, they return home for a few days and then return to sea. Though it is a hard job, it is the only way they know to support their families.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy nets, string, fuel, and food for the days when they have to be at sea. She has been in the loan group for 7 years and she likes it because they always provide her with the loans. Her dream is that nothing will happen to them while they\u2019re at sea. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1511883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy nets, string, fuel, and food .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2014-01-17T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1265.89,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":158.24},{"due_date":"2014-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":158.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T00:25:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":658483,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn, 48 years of age, is married and blessed with three children.

She is glad that her business was assisted and supported by Ruma agents. For the last month, she has had around $30-$40 per day sales on average just from selling mobile phone airtime credits. She hopes to get a working capital loan from Kiva to process more mobile phone airtime credits and bill payment transactions on weekends when more people tend to come to her stall. In the future, she is planning to seek more business opportunities. Komisah thanks you for your support.

Gulayim has a secondary education. Tor provide the primary source of income for her family, Gulayim farms and keeps livestock. She started 27 years ago when she bought cattle with 10,000 KGS.  Because of Gulayim's hard work, her farm now has five dairy cows, fifteen sheep, ten goats, and also a 0.32 hectare plot of land where she grows potatoes, corn, and sunflowers. Also there is a small orchard with apple trees, which produces a good harvest.

She has been able to live with her two sons and her daughter in one of the minority communities of Kosovo. \r\n\r\nIn her village most people are involved in some form of agricultural business in order to make a living. Planinka and her husband grew corn, wheat, and raised pigs for many years in order to make a living. In the first few years they would have to pay for others to harvest and plow their land, but over time they managed to save enough money to purchase their own tractor and increase their productivity and decrease their expenses associated with their land. Now, with the death of her husband, she continues to work on her land and farm with two of her children. \r\n\r\nPlaninka is requesting a loan in order to purchase some parts for her agricultural machine that have been damaged from wear and tear through the years. She says that the loan will help distract her from the sadness and the passing of her husband and allow her to continue the business they had started. In addition, the loan will help her to increase her income and expand her business, as it will allow her to become more effective and efficient in her work. \r\nPlaninka\u2019s dream is to purchase another agricultural machine, such as a tractor, in order to further increase her income and profit. She hopes that her children will get married and start families of their own so that she can enjoy being a grandmother.

Paola needs the help of the loan to purchase her fixed assets (display cabinets, a mixer, kitchen utensils, an oven, a refrigerator and other items), raw materials (flour, sugar, margarine, eggs, milk and other items) and to make some improvements to the space.

The eldest son is nine years old, and the daughter is five. Gulmira is a very caring mother, a good housewife, and a good daughter-in-law. Gulmira and her family live with her 75-year-old mother-in-law and 81-year old grandmother. Gulmira manages to do the housework and child-rearing. Gulmira has a secondary education. The family's main source of income is animal husbandry. Gulmira started this nine years ago when she bought 20,000 KGS worth of cattle. Because of Gulmira's hard work, her farm now has two dairy cows, one horse, one calf, and a 2.70 hectare land share where she grows wheat and corn every year. Gulmira's husband buys and sells cow hides. Their gross monthly income is 8,000 KGS. In order to further expand her farm, Gulmira approached the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy cows for breeding. Gulmira plans to invest profits she makes from the loan into expanding her livestock, and plans to save enough money educate her

She's all of 30 and lives with her family in the Spitamen region of Tajikistan, where she's been raising cattle for the past 5 years.  Her husband taught her the ins & outs of cattle farming; a trade which actually has a lot of interesting facets and nuances to it, despite what you might think at first.  Her family helps her tend to her cattle with the exception of her husband, who left the country as a migrant worker to try and bolster the family's finances.  Barchinoy works equally as hard as her husband to provide for their family, and would like to develop her cattle-farming business further as it's a crucial source of income for them.  She wants to add more cattle to her herds, but lacks the money to do so; as such, she's requesting a loan to buy some cattle, and is counting on your help to get it."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1492078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T23:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barchinoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":112},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":118.1},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":121.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":124.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":131.4},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":138.6},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":142.3},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150.1},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":154.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":158.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":162.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":165.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.1},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.1},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.3},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.6},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.3},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-22T04:01:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":657241,"name":"Tercer Cielo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el grupo tercer cielo esta compuesto por tres integrantes, todos estos se dedican a la venta de pescado en el mercado de chinandega, son madres solteras que se esfuerzan por sacar adelante su negocio y a su familia. una de ellas es la se\u00f1or juana Maria quien trabaja de lunes a domingo desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana a cuatro de la tarde, su negocio  lo empezo con capital propio, con poca mercaderia, anteriormente se dedicaba a la venta de le\u00f1a, es una se\u00f1ora que trabaja para el sustento de su hogar.\n\nsolita el financiamiento para invertir en su negocio comprando pescado de variedad y obtener mas ganancias para asi poder levantar nuevamente su casa ya que hace ocho meses a la se\u00f1ora  Juana se le quemo su casa y ella poco a poco la ha venido arreglando con la ganancias.","en":"The group Tercer Cielo is composed of three members, who all sell fish in the market of Chinandega.

She has two children and is in a common law marriage with her significant other. During her working life she worked as an employee in several restaurants. That's where she acquired experience and knowledge on how to handle this type of business. Thanks to that, a month ago she decided to become self-employed and set up her own fast food stall. She has the advantage of not facing direct competition in this segment, which is why she has obtained good results so far. She requests the loan in order to use it to do remodeling work (repair the sidewalk), purchase tables and chairs, finish paying for the fixed assets that she already acquired, and purchase wholesale supplies (bread, cold cuts, spices, cheese, cooking oil, etc.). That way she'll be able to provide a higher quality service in terms of the food, the comfort in her premises and the courtesy. This means that she'll move forward and improve her sales.\r\nAlicia dreams of opening a restaurant in a commercial area that is large and well-known in the segment. This restaurant could create employment opportunities and allow her to ensure that her children's living conditions and well-being will improve, so they can enjoy this as a family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1492931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to do remodeling work (repair the sidewalk), to purchase tables and chairs, to finish paying for the fixed assets that she already acquired, and to purchase wholesale supplies (bread, cold cuts, spices, cheese, cooking oil, etc.).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-18T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-16T23:30:02Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":89774},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":92253},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":94801},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":97419},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100110},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":102875},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":105716},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108636},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111636},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":114719},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":117887},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":121143},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124489},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":127927},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":131460},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":135091},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":138822},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":142656},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146596},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150644},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":154805},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":159080},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163474},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.56},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.03},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.61},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.16},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.93},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.89},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.97},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.08},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T18:50:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
