Her husband has worked as a painter on a free-lance basis for more than 20 years. They both cooperate together to seek a new and better way of living. Today, Amale is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to equip the teaching room with the needed chairs, table, board, stationery, and other items. She also wants to renovate the room to be able to receive more students. This will be a good beginning for her, especially if she continues to offer the best she has to better educate her students.

Murodi lived in Jakarta, but since he was chosen to be a Ruma branch head, he moved to Bogor Timur. He is single and his mother is only a housewife. Another interesting story about him is that he used to be Ruma\u2019s business partner before he decided to become Ruma\u2019s field officer in the Jakarta Branch. He has been working with Ruma for almost 1.5 years.\n\nAs a Ruma branch head, he feels that a motorcycle is needed to actually run the business, especially in controlling and monitoring the field. Previously as a Field Officer, the only thing he needed to take care of were his business partners. But now, with bigger power comes bigger responsibility. He needs to take care not only of Ruma\u2019s business partners, but also of the Field Officers who work in his branch. And a motorcycle will definitely help him to move around.\n\nRuma\u2019s Network Management Manager recommended him because Murodi needs a motorcycle to conquer the new area where Ruma\u2019s branch is established. And of course it will help his business partners to generate more income too so they can have a better livelihood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":372.37,"image":{"id":1215460,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2775,"youtubeId":"N76NIOztGPY","title":"Kiva

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit.

He hopes with this motorcycle loan, he will be able to work well and it will be easier to be in the field, especially since Tangerang is a big area here.

Her husband died 10 years ago, leaving in her care two sons and a daughter. \n\nAll these years she has been working very hard. She had to take any job that came along, many a time working as a daily wager (day laborer) to support her family. After the death of her husband, it was difficult for her alone to support her family and the children\u2019s education. Her two elder sons had to drop out from school and the eldest son did carpentry work to earn some money for the family. But Domnem, despite all the difficulties, insists on supporting her youngest, a daughter, to continue her studies, and today her daughter is reading in class nine.\n\nIn 2009, one of Domnem's friends informed her that they were forming a group to access a loan from WSDS and she asked Domnem if she would like to join the group. She grasped the opportunity and became a member of Ruth Group. The same year, she received her first loan from WSDS of INR 5,000 and started selling meat at the local market. \n\nEarly morning she would travel to Sekmai, which is about 15 kms, boarding the local bus, and purchase meat from the butchers. On return, she would smoke part of the meat over a fire and sell it in the local market. Dry meat (smoked meat) is a popular delicacy in the locality. \n\nSelling meat, she says, is very profitable and she wishes to carry on her business but in larger quantity. She now asks for another loan of INR 10,000 to increase her sales. With the profit she plans to repair her house.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1216798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase meat from the butcher to smoke and resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-10-22T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-21T17:50:08Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veinem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domnem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneineng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T20:20:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484558,"name":"Anisa Indah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sukati lives in the East of Jakarta.

She gradually amassed capital of her own and traveled to the city of Medell\u00edn where some of the country\u2019s best leather items and clothing are manufactured.  She purchased there precisely the merchandise she used to start her business and to date has secured a market share with customers who like the wallets, purses, footwear and other articles made from first-class leather.\r\n\r\nShe generates income with her business and has been able to educate her children.  Her goal is to continue expanding it until all her children have their own houses because that\u2019s one of the dreams that impels her.  She\u2019s currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy underwear and outerwear, footwear, beauty and personal hygiene products to sell among her clientele because these are the items that rotate best among her customers and many of them have already placed preorders.   Because the second semester of the year is a season of increased sales, she\u2019s going to take advantage of this juncture to make her Kiva loan successful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1218171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

Es en este momento decisivo de mi vida en que el apoyo de la fundaci\u00f3n KIVA seria totalmente fundamental para poder lograr mi sue\u00f1o. \n\nEl desarrollo de la creatividad y la implementaci\u00f3n de nuevas herramientas para forjar productos audiovisuales de calidad es algo que va evolucionando cada vez m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y una carrera profesional ya no es suficiente para mantenerse a la altura de realizadores audiovisuales de talla mundial. Es por eso que mi mayor deseo en este momento es poder realizar un programa de master en direcci\u00f3n cinematogr\u00e1fica en una de las mejores academias del gremio en el mundo. Esta oportunidad ampliar\u00eda mis horizontes como director y me permitir\u00e1 darle un punto de vista mas amplio a las producciones nacionales y porque no, ayudar en el proceso educativo de la nueva generaci\u00f3n de realizadores colombianos.\n","en":"Camilo, from Bogot\u00e1, is 25 years old and graduated from Polit\u00e9cnico Grancolombiano in film direction and production through financing provided by the government because of his academic excellence in high school and because his family couldn't afford the costs of his career. \r\n\r\nCamilo wants to expand his horizons and knowledge through a master's degree in film studies, but he requires the support of KIVA so he will comply with all the requirements to access to his scholarship-credit of Colfuturo Foundation. After finishing his studies, Camilo wants to return home and begin conducting his own films.\r\n\r\nHere is his story: Movies have been one of the major influences in my life. Since childhood, I was attracted to horror films that my parents forbade me to see, but which I still saw. This passion began to turn into a desire not only to be a fan but also a producer of this type of artistic pieces. That is how I decided to become an audiovisual producer. Although my family didn't have the financial support needed to achieve it, I strived to search official announcements and scholarships to help me to achieve my dream.\r\n\r\nThe creativity development and implementation of new tools to build quality audiovisual products is something that is evolving faster and faster and a professional career is not enough to keep up with world-class filmmakers. That's why my biggest wish right now is to pursue a master's program in film directing in one of the best schools of the industry in the world. This opportunity would expand my horizons as a director and would allow me to have a broader perspective to national productions and why not, also to help in the educational process of the new generation of Colombian filmmakers.

She studied social work at a known university and wants to get certified so that she can practice in her field.  Since she is a woman with a lot of initiative, she started to perform temporary work for the state in various social projects.  Also, the main activity that support her is the raising of animals, such as pigs, guinea pigs and sheep, which she raises and feeds to later sell at a higher price.

Desde ni\u00f1o aprendi\u00f3 a sembrar y criar animales. De ah\u00ed decidi\u00f3 estudiar agropecuaria en una reconocida universidad.

La alimentaci\u00f3n de sus cuyes se basa en alfalfa que el mismo siembra, por ello tienen un alto valor nutritivo. Ya lo conocen y constantemente sus clientes le solicitan para vender o comer.

He lives in the company of Bertha, his wife of 20 years. Together they have 3 small children whom they care for in the house they inherited from their parents 20 years ago. From a young age he learned to farm and raise animals. From there he decided to study agriculture in a renowned university. His studies paid off, as  by the time he was 16 he started planting all varieties of root vegetables like a veteran, such as carrot and for flowering plants cauliflower, artichoke and broccoli which he specializes in. He sells his produce in the city market, but the activity that he likes most is the raising of guinea pigs, of which he has 500. His secret is the management of the females, which he separates according to age and relation. He says that every 3 months he increases the number of animals. The food for the guinea pigs is based on the same planting alfalfa, as it has a high nutritious value. His customers already know him and request him for trade or eating. His short term plan is to buy a male breeding guinea pig and 10 females to start to raise animals of a higher quality. This is his 18th loan with MFP. He has a good concept of the group loan, although on many occasions there have been difficulties that have strengthened the confidence in his association, such that today he renews his promise to continue being punctual with his payments. Jes\u00fas will invest the requested funds in the purchase of organic fertilizer to distribute among his crops.

Before entering this business, she was a seamstress. \r\nHer husband is a taxi driver, and his working days begin at six o\u2019clock in the morning, when he takes his wife and children to their schools and the market. Bum-Ayush told us that standing at the counter is hard work for a woman, especially in the winter, but it is more profitable than her previous job. Every month she needs to go to the closest border with China, about two days away by train, to buy goods. Her old house is in incredibly bad condition. Every winter, she must burn 10 tons of coal to stay warm, while other families use only 2-4 tons. Burning more coal burning releases more harmful gas and dust into the atmosphere. Bum-Ayush, like every mother, loves her children, so she is planning to thicken her house walls, using materials such as cement, bricks, and glass-wool insulation, in order to stop the heat loss through the walls.

Ever since he was born, he has lived with his mother Elena in a house she owns. He's a driven young man who recently completed his studies for a technical career in agronomy. Ever since then he has gotten four years' worth of experience in growing high quality corn on his own plots of land. He inherited these plots from his mother, whom he loves very much. Thanks to his knowledge he succeeded in earning good profits, and now he wishes to expand his knowledge through a college education, which is his goal. For that purpose he started a business providing carpentry and infrastructure building services for the public and private sectors. He earns very good profits in this business, and for that reason he's considering hiring professionals in order to increase his earnings and get more customers. However, he doesn't neglect what he loves most, which is agriculture. This is his third loan with MFP. This entire time he has proven to be punctual and responsible, and above all he enjoys being a member of his communal bank which is comprised of supportive people with an enterprising spirit.

She lives with her five children in a home which she inherited 15 years ago. As a farmer, she works with agriculture and livestock. She plants on her own agricultural lands, which take her an hour to get to by foot. After every harvest, she sells her produce in the city of Jauja. She also raises hens, guinea pigs, and cows, which she often sells. \"Through raising my animals I make a weekly income. This helps me to cover some costs,\" she says.

year old woman. She lives in the city of Ica in the district of Santiago with her 6 children. Unfortunately, for various reasons, she has been separated from her husband for some years. Since then, she has put all her effort into bringing up her family. She is a very kind, hardworking and enthusiastic person who has a great desire to succeed. Unfortunately, due to a lack of economic resources and because she needed to work, she was not able to take the Secretariat course that she wanted to, but she would very much liked to have done so. In her free time, she likes to watch the news and educational programs on tv and sometimes she cooks a delicious patasca stew to share with her family. \r\nWith much persistence and dedication, Ana was able to start her small business selling food. She sells breakfast, sandwiches, sodas, and other things.

She dedicates herself to several activities because her biggest dream is to offer her children a good education and good quality of life.  \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Bel\u00e9n tends to her six cows and brings them to pasture so that they give good milk. She uses their milk to make cheeses, which she brings to the capital city to sell. Bel\u00e9n is a well-known vender and has many steady customers. With the help of her husband, she also grows corn, potatoes, peas, and quinoa. Not long ago, they began to also sell many kinds of drinks. It turned out that their sales of beer were very high, so now they want to invest more money in this and buy wholesale in order to get the best price per unit and earn more from their sales.\r\n\r\nThis is Bel\u00e9n's ninth loan with MFP.

is Amil, 25, a resident of Payatas, Philippines. He is married to Emma and a father to his children. He, together with his wife, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmil runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Amil\u2019s case, he is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in poor urban communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. He earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help him expand the business, Amil is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to buy additional used quality clothing. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. He plans to add more pants or jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If he can roll over the profits from this loan, he can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, he can expand his business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nAmil hopes to give his children a good and quality education through all his hard work on his business. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week, and it is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1219392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy additional used quality clothing needed in his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5499.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351057,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4124.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960177,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5334,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5500.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094889,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5499.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339484043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T15:35:37Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":486076,"name":"Isabelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabelita is 45 years old and married with three children.

She manages their household while also operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMa. Jean maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other companies. A customer's order is bought with cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalog, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. \r\n\r\nMa. Jean also has a food stall. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,000 in sales every week. To help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Jean hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to have a good life for her family.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products and supplies to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarilou dreams to have her own house and lot and hopes to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

A father of seven children, he lives in a traditional family in Noumousso, Kadiolo. He owns a shop where he has been selling various staples (cereals, sugar, oil, etc.) for nearly ten years. His experience has earned him a good reputation in his business. He receives orders for cereals such as rice. \r\n\r\nTo have the resources needed to meet customer demand, he joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso six years ago. All past loans were repaid without incident. \r\n\r\nThis loan will allow him to buy one ton of sugar, five 20-liter jugs of oil, and three packages of cookies. He buys his stock at the big market of Kadiolo on fair day. He conducts his sales at his shop for cash, on order, wholesale and at retail, to a clientele consisting of both men and women.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 80,000 FCFA. This profit will allow him to pay the loan interest and to cover most of his expenses, any remainder to be reinvested in his activity. He plans to buy two tons of concrete to finish the land improvements needed to build housing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1222417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy various staples for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T14:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T14:00:32Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amidou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103115,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243380,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624959,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179858,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922659,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636203,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029755,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819344,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678251,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25141.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399923982,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-23T22:53:31Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T17:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":486146,"name":"Salai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salai is a 27-year-old married woman with four children.\r\n \r\nShe started a small plantation to grow taro, bananas and yams to earn a living.

For the last 20 years she has worked in sales.  Her business was born when she decided to give free reign to her independent spirit in order to earn income to cover her personal expenses.  In her business, she sells cosmetics, shoes, cologne, undergarments and clothes.  She distributes them on credit, but she purchases them with immediate payment.  \r\n\r\nDuring her work day, which starts at 8 in the morning and ends at 6 in the afternoon every day, she offers her customers products from specialized guide books or catalogs.  She attends to their needs and successfully makes negotiations which benefit them.  She is attentive to the discounts offered in the magazines in order to pass the benefits on to her customers, for whom she cares so much.  \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to open a general store to the public in order to capture the market surrounding her because a lot of people don\u2019t know that this type of business exists and a commercial location would resolve this situation.  She dreams that in the future her children will complete a quality education so that they have great potential to be successful and that is her most important motivation.  \r\n\r\nPresently she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing from the Foundation Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy creams, perfumes, hair products, clothes, shoes and accessories.  By investing her Kiva loan in this season of great commercial activity, her sales have a great probability of increasing, as happens every year-end and this is what will make her Kiva loan successful.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1221127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy body creams, perfume, personal hygiene products, footwear, cosmetics and feminine accessories.  \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-10-23T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-22T15:40:10Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nevis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94167},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130801,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519656,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071500,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497713,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527527,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928288,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705445,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94167,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":97362.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390967744,"comment":null},{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":376664,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":389447.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399816947,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-20T22:02:42Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T12:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":487282,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mujer con \u00e9xitos y fracasos pero con la idea de mejorar su vida y la de su familia.
