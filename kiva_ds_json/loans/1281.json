is a 42-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

He has lot of customers who like to buy fabrics from him. Sometimes he purchases fabrics from out of the city to minimize the cost and sells it to the retailers. He has good reputation in the market and his current customers refer him to the other retailers as well. As a result, new customer demand is increasing day by day but he does not have sufficient funds to buy more fabrics.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Shagufta requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her husband would be able to buy more fabrics to fulfill the demand.\r\nShe is in her third loan cycle and has shown an excellent repayment behavior. She has already been taking the loan from BRAC and investing in the business. She hopes that the savings will much increase and she will complete the remaining construction of her house. Her dreams are for the bright future of her children, establishment of her business, and better living standards for her family. Shagufta is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":31.26,"image":{"id":1483157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing for resale.

He has worked with Arvand for more than two years. Askarjon's first loan was used to renovate his house. In April, Askarjon's seasonal work begins. He makes bricks, which requires a lot of physical strength. His wife does not work. She is a housewife and takes care of the children. To make an income sufficient to meet his family's needs, Askarjon works a second job. He works in animal husbandry. He raises and sells cattle. Now he is just starting this business and hopes that it will help him to improve his family's economic situation. Therefore Askarjon approached Arvand for a loan to buy a few head of cattle. He thanks Arvand in advanced for the financial

However, he doesn't have enough money to do so.  For this reason, he is taking a loan to bring new merchandise in and increase his sales.

I love being involved in different extracurricular activities. I volunteer in my school and in the Youth Center of Khorog. My responsibilities both at school and the Youth Center are the same: I teach Math and English language. At school I teach to younger students, but as for the Youth Center, there are students of different ages attending my classes. Before applying to the American University of Central Asia, I have conducted a small research and interviews with the currently enrolled students, trying to identify the amounts of funds required for studying at AUCA and living in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. I leave in the family of 7, including myself. I am the eldest child in the family, meaning that I bear the responsibility to support my younger sister and brother and my parents now, when I already grew up. Therefore my family is not able to afford full tuition fees at AUCA. I need KIVA loan to ensure that I will not have to think about finance while I pursue my degree. I think it is worth mentioning that from the very beginning, when I just heard about the American University of Central Asia, I started thinking of studying there, as lots of people study there from all over Central Asian region, and it is one of the best Universities in the region. AUCA gives lots of opportunities to all the students one of which is Kiva loan.

This group consists of 9 women who have worked for 8 years as an organised group in Fray Casiano, an area of great poverty in Puntarenas, in the central Pacific region of  Costa Rica. They have shown a good understanding of the concepts of group work: solidarity, saving, as well as coordinating activities to generate funds. They have clear rules on the work. The women have asked for loans and understand the working of the group model. They have a board of directors and the documents were prepared to request this third loan, to have one new companion join who had participated in the first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, as well as have one woman leave who took part in the former loan with the communal bank Mujer Emprendedoras. Their hard work and effort has allowed each of them to be better street merchants; this fact was evidenced during a visit with each one of the members.<br \/><br \/>Yesenia is a member of the group and she will invest her loan in buying sandals, clothes, beauty products and general merchandise, thus increasing her inventory and meeting orders placed during Christmas and New Year, which is a great opportunity for sales. In addition, these women sell food and raffles, which allows them to increase their saving and support their family with the household costs and with their children's education, since the majority of the members are single mothers and heads of their household, and their economic support is very important to their own quality of life as well as to that of their sons and daughters.<br \/><br \/>Yesenia is a tenacious woman and, thanks to the internal organisation of the group, she manages the weekly repayments which allows them more leeway to obtain money for repaying the loan. She is the president of the group and they consider her a good leader and hope to get this loan in order to continue growing daily. They are hard-working women who have managed to succeed and improve their families' incomes by means of this group. They support their children's studies and support their partners with the family costs. They have managed to make their presence felt in the area where they live and are known for their weekend activities, when they sell food in the community. This gives work to others (mainly family members) through the preparation of these dishes which are typical of the coastal area of Costa Rica. They include vigor\u00f3n (boiled yuca or cassava mixed with crunchy pork rinds and covered with a spicy cabbage coleslaw). traditional pig soup, shellfish and tamales, which is a sort of steam-cooked corn dough and often served at Christmas."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy sandals, clothing, beauty products, and general merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Puntarenas, Fray Casiano","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2014-01-01T11:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T11:10:01Z","loan_amount":6950,"lender_count":259,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dayana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaricsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":3450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":6950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":283513.9},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":289184.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":294967.86},{"due_date":"2014-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":300867.22},{"due_date":"2014-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":306884.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":313022.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":319282.7},{"due_date":"2014-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":325668.35},{"due_date":"2014-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":332181.72},{"due_date":"2014-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":338825.35},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":345601.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":571.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":594.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":606.09},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":618.22},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":630.58},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.19},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":656.06},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":669.18},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":682.56},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":696.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-21T18:04:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640824,"name":"Abundio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abundio is a young entrepreneur who provides motor transport services in his community.

50 and married with four children. Three of them are married and live on their own, and her youngest son lives with his parents and works selling coal. Mastura has a high school education and raises animals and crops as the primary source of income for her family, a business she began 20 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has four milk cows and 12 sheep that are well taken care of as well as a small parcel of land on which she grows hay, enough to harvest 600 bales in a season. She uses 300 of these bales for her own animals and sells the rest. Mastura's husband also helps a great deal with the business, monthly income from which is 5,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Mastura has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase a cow and a calf for fattening and resale. She plans to use profits from the loan for further augmentation of her herd, and for improvement of her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1483323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow and a calf for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chimgen village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mastura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2014-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.25},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-17T21:01:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640839,"name":"Rehana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehana is the age of 45, living in Lahore, with her husband and six children. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been running a barber shop for many years.

From a very young age he worked in farming, growing a variety of the most profitable products in the area such as organic cocoa, coffee, barbasco and other crops. Over time he was able to fulfil his objectives, one of which was to build his own house. After a few years he decided, on the recommendation of a family member, to make a living by buying produce and gradually this became his main business. He has been doing this for more than 10 years and this has enabled him to make good profits which have benefitted the household finances. \r\n\r\nLuciano says that working with barbasco requires a certain amount of care, since they are roots which will ultimately be used for insecticides and natural repellents. He really likes his work since he acts as a bridge between the growers who bring their produce to him, to an area he has set side at his home, and the big wholesale buyers in the region whom he sells to. This is how he makes his profits. \r\n\r\nThis is Luciano's second loan with Kiva and he is grateful for the financial support he is getting to make progress in life.

She hopes to support her husband with the financial responsibility of the household.\n\nHer drive and enterprising spirit lead her to request the support of the loan, with which she wants to buy shelves to store the produce, produce wholesale, shelving, and a tank of propane gas.  This way she can begin her work project, with which she hopes to be able to improve her family's living conditions.\n\nYaneri knows that to achieve her goals and get her business ahead she has to work with discipline, determination, and a lot of dedication.  This is the key to success and being able to keep on making progress toward realizing her dreams.  She especially dreams of having her own store, which will generate more profits for her so she can give her children a better future that is full of opportunities to advance and be honest and successful people.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables, a deep fryer, and propane gas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T17:40:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49977},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51360},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52782},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54243},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55745},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57288},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58873},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60503},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62178},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63899},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65667},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67485}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.77},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.06},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.87},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.69},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.54},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.31},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-09T01:18:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640351,"name":"Yurany Estefan\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yurany, es una joven emprendedora que, con tan s\u00f3lo 22 a\u00f1os de edad se dedica a atender su propio negocio, un almac\u00e9n de bolsos ubicado en el parque principal del municipio donde reside, all\u00ed trabaja todos los d\u00edas de 9:00 am a 7:00 pm y de esta manera genera los ingresos econ\u00f3micos suficientes para apoyar a su esposo con la carga del hogar.

Leticia works as an assistant in the kitchen of a tourist center nearby.  Her working hours are long, and she balances this work with cooking and other household chores.  Leticia lives with her husband Jesus, a construction worker, and their two children. \n\nEach time they have to use the restroom they have to walk a couple of blocks to the community facility.  To avoid this inconvenience when showering, they simply use a bucket and cup at their house.  The family has been living here for the last 5 years, working hard to save and continuously improve their house.  When they first moved into their house the family bought kitchen appliances, but they have been using and storing them on their front porch because they have no space inside the house.  \n\nSince Leticia and Jesus do not have formal jobs and their income is low and variable, around $800 USD a month, neither of them has access to credit from banks or other organizations.

They meet every fifteen days in a place named Higuer\u00f3n in the city of Portoviejo.  The members are involved in a diverse array of business activities, such as agriculture and commerce.  Some time ago, upon learning about La Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, they decided to form their community bank so that they could take advantage of loans from this institution.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Gema.  She is twenty-five years old and lives with her common-law husband and their two children who are 6 and 10 years of age.  The children attend a local school.  Her husband works at a gas station.\r\n\r\nGema learned the trade of tailoring a few years back at a school in the city, with the intention of being able to earn something through her own efforts and thus be able to help with the household expenses.  Over five years ago, she installed a small sewing shop in her home.  Many people come to her so that she can repair their clothing or make new clothing for them.  She mainly makes clothing for women and children.  She works every day.  She enjoys the work, since apart from allowing her to make some income for the good of her family, it permits her to be at home so that she can help her children with their homework.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to purchase a sewing machine and thus improve the quality of her work.  She has been with the community bank since the beginning, and she finds the loans to be helpful so that she can continue in her business.  Her dream is to give the best possible life to her family.\r\n\r\nThe small photo shows three members who were not able to be present when the group photo was taken."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1482363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":5600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela Mireya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jacinta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania Katherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belen Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narciza De Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Julia Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gema Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Johana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva Jessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gonzalo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yari Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5597.84,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":699.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":699.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1400,"local_amount":1399.46,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439730393,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-03T00:26:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640945,"name":"Bilal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bilal is 44 years old.

","en":"Ariel, who is 50 years old, is married and the father of two children whom he has taken care of with sacrifice and dedication. During the last years of his employment, he worked for four years at a nationally-known producer of dairy products as a deliveryman. However, at that point they required that he replace his vehicle to continue working. Since he didn't have the resources to do it, he had to resign from the company. Soon after, he sold his truck; with the money he received and the little bit of on-the-job knowledge he had acquired as a driver, he opened his own auto mechanic's shop. For the seven years that he has been running this business, he has managed to generate the income he needs to pay for the basic needs of his household. \r\n\r\nCurrently, he is requesting the support of a loan; he hopes to buy work tools, a drill, and assorted replacement parts at wholesale (spark plugs, lights, rearview mirrors, axles, brakes, and other parts) and to pay off some outstanding debts. This will allow him to replace the tools that have gotten lost and improve the service he provides. With the necessary supplies and tools on hand, he will optimize his labor time and be able to serve a larger number of customers, thus generating additional income. Ariel hopes to keep working in that way to keep his business running, strengthen it, and grow it in order to generate greater income. With that extra income, he would like to open a parts shop alongside his workshop; this will supplement the money coming in to sustain his household and provide his family with a better quality of life."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1481301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","use":"to buy work tools, a drill, and assorted replacement parts at wholesale (spark plugs, lights, rearview mirrors, axles, brakes, and other parts) and to pay off some outstanding debts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-12-02T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-31T22:40:07Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ariel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68774},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70677},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72634},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74644},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76710},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78834},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81016},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83258},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85563},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87931},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90365},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92866},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95437},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98079},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100793},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103583},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106451},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109397},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112425},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115537},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118735},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122022},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125399},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128870}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.88},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.14},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.59},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.66},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":640957,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma is married, with one child.

Turgunbuu has a higher education. She works as a teacher at a local school. Her husband does not work, but he helps on the farm. He prepares hay and feed for the winter for the livestock. To make additional income for her family, Turgunbuu works in animal husbandry and horticulture. She started twelve years ago when she bought livestock for 15,000 KGS. Because of Turgunbuu's hard work, her farm now has eight dairy cows, 31 sheep, and a small garden with apples and plums.

She sells food that she makes within her area and has been running this business since 2010. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week.

She works at the business from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm, seven days per week.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nida Group is a group composed of five Filipino ladies wishing to acquire a loan from Al Majmoua. They all work in Lebanon to provide their families a better living. They decided to join hands and establish the group because they all truly need support with their financial expenses. \r\n\r\n\r\nNida is the group leader and featured member of the group. She is the second lady from the right side of the picture and is wearing a yellow top. She is a 44-year-old single mother of five children, for whom she is sacrificing her life to provide them with the best living and education ever. They live back in the Philippines, where she dreams of going back and establishing her own business soon. She is the only financial provider of the family, since the children's father does not acknowledge the family any more. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that she has a very low income makes it impossible for her to be able to rightfully provide for her children, or even cover her own expenses. The Al Majmoua loan will be invested in supporting her in her own business, preparing and selling Filipino food.
