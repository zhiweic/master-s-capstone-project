","en":"Sangali is married and has two adolescent children.  Since childhood, he dreamed of having his own land and using it as he pleased.  It took a lot of effort for him to obtain a land-use certificate three years ago, and that day was a special day for him and his family.  At first, it was difficult for Sangali to start his business, and he ran into various barriers.

man. He is constantly taking on challenges in order to get ahead and help his children who still depend on him. Lino is single and dedicates himself to caring for his children and to his work. At present this small, humble family lives in the city of Caman\u00e1, which is located in the south of the country; Caman\u00e1 is known for delicious seafood dishes. As proof of that, Lino considers shrimp chowder the best dish of all, and therefore chose it as his favorite food. \r\n\r\nLino wasn't able to finish high school, but knew that that wasn't going to hold him back. Like the determined youth he was, he began to make excursions into different types of business until the moment when he bought a moto taxi. Since then he has worked twelve hours a day and attends to 50 customers. His performance and dedication show results at the end of the day, as he can earn up to S\/.70 on a good day. This income and his constant effort have allowed Lino to enroll his children in superior schools, so that both can develop themselves professionally. He hopes that they will be very good professionals, honorable and passionate for what they do. \r\n\r\nLino's dream is to be able to buy another moto taxi and to make some repairs to his home, so that his children can continue with their studies. But to do this he needs to buy another moto taxi. Lino's goal is to buy it in six months and generate substantially more income, but in order to be able to buy it he needs to save and work hard. He has had the idea of making some repairs to his moto taxi and this way can secure his 'tool of the trade' and earn the income necessary for his great dream. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":977562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain his moto taxi.

is 31 years old.  He is a single man and lives with one of his parents and a sibling.  He and his brother work hard in order to meet his family's needs and provide a comfortable life.  After twelve years of experience, Kassem opened his own shop selling car wheels in 2005.

He provides them with credit which is negotiated directly with each customer and adjusted to his or her needs. He also sends merchandise for the retail business his wife owns in the village of Carmen de Bol\u00edvar, a business ran by her parents. On weekends he also makes hayacas (cornmeal, meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves) and pastries made of dough, rice, meat, pork and chicken. He distributes them in booths where he permanently makes his pre-sales in order to define the amount of pastries he should make. Still, he works part time as a salesman for a company and that helps him get much more customers every day, so his business is thriving. Through his business and the way he works, he has been able to provide for his family which is comprised of his spouse and their three children aged between 4 and 7 years old. His life as an entrepreneur first started when he became unemployed and invested his severance pay in preparing food which he sold by order. This allowed him to gradually add more income-generating activities to his life, and that keeps him active and seeking more and more well-being for his family. His goal is to purchase display cases and shelves in order to better organize his business. Leonardo faces a major challenge because his working capital is not enough to meet the customers' demands. That is the reason why he turns to credikiva, his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this money he will purchase merchandise such as toys, purses, shoes and clothing. That way he can benefit from the coming season of high sales, when he will get more profits as well as more mobility for his merchandise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":943296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

year-old young man, who has a higher education degree in construction engineering and works in his field.  He sells painting and decorating materials at the central market.  He has a wide selection of merchandise that is in high demand.  He sells at a leased store by himself and develops his business.  Bakhtiyor started his business by putting together a team of workers, specializing in construction and decoration work, and worked on houses, apartments and offices repair orders.  He earned a living through this work and provided for his family for several years.  Because he had regular clients, who purchased paint and materials, he decided to open an additional business of selling construction materials.  Bakhtiyor combined both businesses since he could sell his merchandise for his own orders to repair apartments and houses, making it more profitable for him.  When he opened his construction materials store, he obtained a small loan from a bank and started his business.  Business was going well, and Bakhtiyor increased his goods turnover.  He worked a lot with lending organizations and never violated procedures.  Prior to the inflation, he obtained financing in international currency, but got burned.  So, since the inflation in December of 2009, he tried to obtain a loan in the national currency and came to us.  According to the client's words, our loan was very timely for him and helped him a lot in improving his family affairs.  Bakhtiyor plans to use this loan to purchase a wholesale inventory of sealants and paint at a low price."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":979047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase sealants and paint wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-01-11T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-10T20:50:07Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakhtiyor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":348.2,"local_amount":348.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":348.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381622,"comment":null},{"amount":179.58,"local_amount":179.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095138,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":183.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919598,"comment":null},{"amount":187.16,"local_amount":187.16,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":187.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197618,"comment":null},{"amount":191.07,"local_amount":191.07,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":191.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197292,"comment":null},{"amount":195.07,"local_amount":195.07,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":195.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397344,"comment":null},{"amount":1715.59,"local_amount":1715.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1715.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452186,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T18:51:23Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369661,"name":"Imad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imad is a 38-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents.

He lives in Ak-Bulak, a village in the south of Kyrgyzstan. He has five kids, and his wife is a homemaker. Since 1991, Abdalym\u2019s family has been successfully engaged in growing crops and livestock breeding. Today, the Abdalym\u2019s farm has cows and calves, and enough corn, hay and oil cake for their feed. After cultivating 0.25 hectares of land, Abdalym\u2019s family collected 2.5 tons of potatoes, which they will use during the winter. The income from such business allowed Abdalym to buy a car for his family. \r\n\r\nAbdalym applied for a loan of 100.000 som (KGS) from Bai-Tushum & Partners to purchase more cattle. In the very near future, Abdalym is planning to arrange for his son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":939283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-11T21:50:25Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdalym","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975598,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370772,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095383,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070917,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012559,"comment":null},{"amount":161.25,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7546.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754536,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631362,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013739,"comment":null},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427152,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T09:03:20Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T09:44:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370103,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 33-year-old married man living with his wife.

Sami wants to purchase new bedroom furniture in order to offer comfortable conditions in his house, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN to pay.  When Sami receives the loan, he will purchase new bedroom furniture.  Sami is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Para poder salir adelante el y su esposa trabajan arduamente todos los d\u00edas, su esposa es una mujer que se dedica a la venta de men\u00fas, cervezas y salchipollos, esta ganancias les permiten recaudar el dinero necesario para los gastos del hogar.\n\nPedro, como todo hombre de familia responsable, se dedica a la venta diaria de Raspadillas  desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde, este duro laborar le permite ganar en promedio S\/.80 diarios y si es un muy buen d\u00eda, que es lo que Pedro desea a diario, \u00e9l puede ganar hasta S\/.180, normalmente atiende entre 60 y 130 clientes. El sabe que su negocio tiene \u00e9xito porque los jarabes que usa para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus raspadillas est\u00e1n a base de pura fruta y atiende muy bien a sus clientes.  Pedro tiene que aprovechar esta temporada tan calurosa en la ciudad de Mala, porque solo es en estos 3 primeros meses del a\u00f1o donde su producto va ser muy solicitado.  Su analista nos coment\u00f3 que el se\u00f1or Pedro fue ubicado en una plaza de Coayllo, ubicada en la ciudad de Mala, y ha debido de esperar para poder realizar la entrevista debido a que tiene mucha afluencia de clientes, incluso hay combis y autos de donde la gente se baja especialmente para comprar su producto y luego retornar al autom\u00f3vil donde se encontraban.\n\nEsta familia est\u00e1 en constante apego y apoyo familiar, es por esto que Pedro tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en dedicarse a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, solo cuando tiene contratos de construcci\u00f3n, y es as\u00ed como genera ingresos los meses restantes del a\u00f1o para su familia. Gracias al apoyo de los prestatarios Kiva, \u00e9l podr\u00e1 comprase una moto lineal, la misma que le servir\u00e1 para poder llevar su rica raspadilla a zonas aleda\u00f1as y vender cuando hayan festividades o actividades de otro tipo, su meta es poder generar los ingresos necesarios para educar a sus 3 peque\u00f1os e implementar su negocio con sillas y esas nuevas, pero su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande es poder ampliar su casa y colocar el restaurant que tiene su esposa en la parte frontal de la misma.\n","en":"Pedro is a 39-year-old man.  He\u2019s married and he and his wife have three little children who are 5, 8 and 12 years old, all attending school although they are currently on vacation.  In order to get ahead, he and his wife work hard every day.  His wife\u2019s a woman who sells daily meals, beer and \u2018salchipollos\u2019 [traditional fast food snack consisting of fried potatoes with fried chicken and condiments].  Profits allow them to earn money needed for household expenses.\r\n\r\nPedro, like all responsible family men, works every day.  He sells \u2018raspadillas\u2019 [shaved ice topped with flavored syrup] from 9 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon.  This hard work enables him to earn on average 80 soles a day and if he has a very good day, which is what Pedro wishes for every day, he can earn up to 180 soles.  He normally tends to between 60 and 130 customers.  He knows that his business is successful because the syrups he uses to make the shaved ice are based on pure fruit and because he provides very good customer service.  Pedro must take advantage of the hot season in the city of Mala because during the first three months of the year his product is highly sought-after.  His loan adviser commented to us that Pedro was situated in one of Coayllo\u2019s squares located in the city of Mala and his interview had to be postponed because of the large affluence of customers he has.  Besides, there are buses and autos that the people get off of precisely to buy his product and then climb in again.\r\n\r\nThis family constantly support and love each other and this is why Pedro has also gone into bricklaying but only when he gets construction contracts.  This is how he generates additional income for the family during the other months of the year.\r\n\r\nThanks to support from Kiva lenders he will be able to buy a linear motorcycle that he can use to transport his shave ice maker from place to place and go to nearby zones to sell when they have their festivals or other types of activities.  His goal is to generate the necessary income to educate his three little ones and to supply his business with new tables and chairs.  But his greatest dream is to be able to enlarge his house and install his wife\u2019s restaurant in the front part of it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":978550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a

He lives in Ica, Peru.  Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, almost four hours south of Lima, the country's capital, and it is renowned by Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\"  It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus, and olive production, and perhaps above all as the source of Peru's traditional national drink, pisco.  This customer's home and business can be found in this hot, dry climate. It is common knowledge that Peru has some of the most delicious food in the world and one of his favorite dishes is arroz chaufa.  Gustavo only went to school up until the fifth grade because of his parents' limited financial resources, but he would have liked to have studied civic engineering.\r\n\r\nGustavo lives with his partner, who sells salchipapas.  They have two children together, the eldest of whom is in the fifth grade, with the youngest in the first grade.\r\n\t\r\nGustavo molds and fires bricks for a living.  He does this work five hours a day and he is able to serve one customer per day.  Because this work is very hard and demanding, he is able to earn 60 nuevos soles a day and on a good day he can earn up to 80, which helps him with extra household expenses and which allows him to invest in his business.  He believes that his business is going well because there is always a clientele for this kind of work.  He also works helping his partner sell mototaxis and this is going well for them because of the way his partner seasons her dishes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, he is very thankful to Kiva's borrowers because with this help he will be able to help his partner do some maintenance work on her sandwich cart and with this improvement she will have more supplies with which to make her salchipapas and hamburgers.  This will also increase her earnings, which will improve their quality of life and allow them to continue to save, which will help them achieve their greatest dream: offering their children a profession.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":978653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

children.  His wife is not employed and takes care of the household.  Rahim comes to his place of work every morning at the largest city market, Panshanbe, in the city center.  Here, he is involved in selling fruits and vegetables.  His selection includes bananas, apples, pears and tropical fruits, and out of vegetables - tomatoes and cucumbers.  Local farmers and dekhan farmers, who deliver fruits and vegetables to him, supply him with the products in the spring.  He travels to the neighboring Uzbekistan himself in the winter, and also buys products from local farmers, who grow fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.  Rahim's oldest son (shown on the photograph) helps him with running the business and also when Rahim leaves to buy products.  Besides this, his son is an auto-mechanic and is involved in car repairs.  Rahim has been working with our organization since 2002 and has shown himself as an exemplary and punctual client throughout this time.  He wants to use the loan in the sum of 12000 somoni to buy a car, which he plans to use for the family and for the business.  Rahim is grateful to Arvand for supporting his business and hopes to have a lasting

He lives in this town together with his wife and three children who are between 7 and 12 years old.  Rafael's business idea was born when he lost his job in a factory.  He invested his severance pay in buying drinks and this business has enabled him to provide for his family.

It helps him to stay in the market and continually improve his family's well-being.  \r\n\r\nRafael currently plans to make the most of the end-of-year season which is very good for selling drinks.  For this reason, he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will use it to buy soft drinks, beers, cookies and other products.

Stepan produces and distributes advertising. His office is conveniently located in the city centre. He's been in this business for four years. Even after new competition appeared two years ago, Stepan's professionalism has allowed him to maintain his brand to this day. Stepan's current monthly income is slightly above 5000 hryvnia. With the help of this loan from Kiva, he hopes to purchase a large-format printer and to install windows in his office. The printer will expand the range of services that Stepan's company offers. The new windows will improve the insulation of the workspace, plus Stepan will be able to use them for additional advertisement.\r\n\r\nStepan was educated in Hungary.

lives in Iraq with his wife and four children.
