She is a brave and entrepreneurial woman, is 32 years of age, and is mother to four children. All of her children are at school, except for the youngest, and her husband is a driver.\r\n\r\nKavira works selling food items, and began her business using funds received from her husband about five years ago. She then benefitted from her first loan from the Hekima microfinance institution around 2010, which gave her additional funds. She said that this helped her raise her children. The profits generated by her business allow her to save, as well as to school and feed her family.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kavira has now applied for a seventh loan. This new loan will be used to buy supplies of flour, oil, beans, etc., and the rest of the money will be used to buy school items for her children. She also plans to build a home. Kavira thanks Hekima and its partners for the steps they take to help poor women with low income become more autonomous. Please note that one of the clients in the photo is carrying her baby.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1091491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

At this time she is studying Electrical Engineering at the Universidad Industrial de Santander, one of the best engineering universities in Colombia.  This is all thanks to the important tuition discounts she managed to get because of her excellent academic performance and because she lives in one of the neighborhoods with the least resources in Bucaramanga.\r\n\r\nDairy lives with her mother, who is unemployed.  She is the oldest of three sisters.  She now wants to request this loan from Kiva because it is the only way she has to be able to pay for the preparation course and registration for the TOEL exams, which are the first steps to being able to fulfill her dream.\r\n\r\nThe following is her story:  \r\n\r\nMan does not stop dreaming until he limits himself.  In my youth I visualized the biggest opportunity to be dreaming and to dare, without qualms, to complete everything I had proposed to do.  It is here, in the middle of my objectives and hopes, where I realize that knowledge is the greatest wealth.  It is invaluable, constant, memorable, and worthy of being considered to be the fortune that cannot be taken away from people. \r\n\r\nIt is among my aspirations as a student to acquire and internalize everything that is learned.  Later, after having done this in an atmosphere of more advanced studies, I want to able to undertake a path of returning to my county and applying, in a sound and executable way, said knowledge.  In this way I will be able to contribute to the country\u2019s technological, financial, and social development.  These are three factors that are now essentially fundamental to the complete development of a country.\r\n\r\nI am a student with good academic credentials.  I am prepared to work closely with the technological development of the country.  I will do so with a great desire to integrate what I have learned with new knowledge that can contribute to my academic and spiritual formation.\r\n\r\nI believe that you never stop learning.  Every day we have the obligation to take advantage of each moment life gives us and the time to cultivate knowledge.  The world of knowledge is open to anyone who wants to enter it, and I am prepared to do so.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":108.33,"image":{"id":1187207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses for her Master's Degree studies in Environmental and Energy engineering.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bucaramanga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-05T14:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-05T14:10:13Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dairy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.67},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":96666.67,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":98691.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042083,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":96666.67,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":98691.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710432,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-05T16:54:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":468078,"name":"Gnem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gnem is 43 years old, married, and has four children.

three of whom are dependent on her and some are in school. To support the family, she has been farming rice on five hectares of farmland for several years and supplements her income by raising pigs. The current business earns her about 23,000KHR per day and she manages to save about 10,000KHR each day for the future.

Nikoloz requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \n\nThe total average monthly income of the family is 250 Laris, including Keto\u2019s pension. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the vulnerable poor category. \n\nNikoloz is a musician by profession. He requested a loan from Credo for purchasing a musical instrument, in particular an electric piano. His loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \n After purchasing the instrument, Nikoloz will get a steady job in a local restaurant, and at the same time he will be able to provide services to the local population for private personal and corporate parties. The new business initiative will increase the monthly income of the family by 200 - 300 laris, which will mean more than 100% increase. Nikoloz and his mother will be able to improve their living conditions.

He is 43 years old, married, and is raising 3 children. \r\n\r\nFor over 4 years, Ahmadjon has been raising crops, including wheat, potatoes, carrots, and so on. He sells his harvest at the market. Because his produce is of very high quality, there is great demand for it. His wife, children and brother help him in his business. \r\n\r\nAhmadjon wants to provide his family with all the necessities of life.

She says she works in her home Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m.  Her mother also works with her.

a former athlete, Rex has always been passionate about health and fitness. Since he loved taking care of people, he worked part-time as a paramedic until he purchased a Snap Fitness franchise in the Houston suburb of Spring. Rex said he was looking for freedom and the ability to have family time. Rex moved to Texas in 1980 from the Midwest and started a new life in the Lone Star State, marrying and starting a family. His wife and children participate in the management of this unique family-run gym in the Houston area. Rex and his family pride themselves in knowing each gym member.\r\n\r\nRex's gym offers a Fitness-on-Demand room, which is a virtual classroom members can use for activities such as Pilates, yoga, kickboxing, spin classes and step aerobics. Rex obtained a loan from Accion Texas Inc. to purchase a new piece of equipment to better assist his members: a TRX.  The fitness device was created by a former Navy SEAL and uses the operator's weight as resistance for a full-body workout. Rex said he doesn't want his members to feel lost in using any of his equipment and is currently offering classes on how to use the machine.\r\n\r\nRex's venture has created three jobs and he plans to contract with two other trainers. Since approval of the loan in late July and the purchase of the TRX, three people have signed for new memberships. Snap Fitness is open but not staffed 24 hours a day, which Rex says helps him keep membership prices lower than other gyms.

Currently Boris is married and has four children and in order to generate the income that his family requires he raises crops.  In spite of encountering some difficulties, he has always struggled to succeed and to bring his family a better quality of life.  Approximately one year ago the winter was at the point of destroying his harvest and it severely affected his economic situation and that of his family.  For that reason he is now looking for a loan in order to purchase fertilizer and to re-fertilize his fields in order to harvest good quality products and be able to receive a good price for

is from the village of Patardzeuli, East Georgia. She is 42 years old. Sopio is married and lives with her son, a daughter-in-law and a daughter. \r\n\r\nThe family earns a living through a dairy business. In particular, they have three milk cows. Sopio milks the cows and produces cheese. She sells milk and cheese locally. Sopio is a very hard-working woman, but she still doesn\u2019t have enough income to make some savings and improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n \r\nShe requested a loan to purchase food for the cattle and to renovate her house. With this credit, she will purchase hay, which will be used for feeding the cows during the fall and winter seasons. Since the cows will be fed properly in winter, they will give a planned amount of milk to the family. Sopio also plans to purchase building materials and repair the house, which is old and damaged. Due to the above mentioned, the living conditions of the family will be improved and they will be able to spend their evenings after a hard working day in a more comfortable environment. Sopio hopes for your help and kindness.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1186378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

The UNIDO SOMOS [We Are United] communal bank is in El Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Puerto Pechiche parish, Pueblo Viejo canton. The communal bank members are seasonal farmers who grow corn, rice and beans. Rosaura grows corn, rice, and beans. She buys her products at the Karlita agricultural supply center and sells at the Castillo center. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to plant corn, rice, and beans and to buy seeds, urea, farm supplies, and fertilizers for the crops.

A lo largo de estos a\u00f1os me he esforzado por  mantenerme fiel a mi actividad creadora, brind\u00e1ndome el tiempo que conlleva la dedicaci\u00f3n y la disciplina; y aunque esto signifique pocas entradas econ\u00f3micas, me pone un gran reto personal y profesional como artista. \n\nHe luchado por esos ideales d\u00eda tras d\u00eda, equilibrando el tiempo de ense\u00f1anza y la practica art\u00edstica; compartiendo con otros mi pasi\u00f3n por la pintura, el color y la forma he ense\u00f1ado  a ni\u00f1os, j\u00f3venes y adultos; junto con la asistencia a talleres y  participaci\u00f3n en exposiciones, he ido construyendo una mejor calidad de vida como artista y tratando de con poco hacer mucho.

She studied Visual Arts at the Universidad P\u00fablica de Caldas.  This is thanks to the socio-economic incentives she received from the Colombian government.  At this time Valentina does not have a steady job, and she devotes a large part of her time with her mother, who is very ill.\r\n\r\nValentina\u2019s dream is to get a Master\u2019s Degree in the United States or the United Kingdom.  The support from Kiva would help her be able to pay for the preparation courses for TOEL, registration for the exam, and the applications to various universities, which are very expensive.  With Kiva support she would also be able to pay for the cost of sending out her portfolio and documents.\r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nUpon finishing my undergraduate studies in Art, I have just started a new stage of my life.  Since then every decision I have made has been thinking about reaching my dream of studying for a Master\u2019s in Fine Arts.  During these years I have made a great effort to stay true to my creative activity, affording myself the dedication and discipline that it involves.  Even though this signifies little financial benefits, I am setting a big goal personally and professionally as an artist.\r\n\r\nI have struggled for these goals day after day.  I have balanced my instruction time and my artistic practice time.  I am sharing my passion for painting, color, and form with others.  I have taught children, youth, and adults.  Along with attending workshops and participating in expositions, I have been building a better quality of life as an artist.  I am trying to do much with little.  I believe, as Fernando Gonzalez well said, \u201cThose who triumph owe it to a strong belief, generally a belief in themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nI now want to reach this dream, and along the way I found the regional Semillero de Talentos [\u201cSeedbed\u201d of Talent] and Kiva.  They have been, and will be, a great personal and professional support in a time when I need to pay for the university applications, the preparation courses, and the TOEFL IBT exams.\r\n\r\nWith your help I hope to be able to makes this dream a reality that embraces not just me, but my community as well.  With this, upon my return from studying, I would like to make an impact on an entrepreneurial level by teaching children and sharing experiences that strengthen the Art programs in my city.  I would like to make an impact on the quality of the programs and the strength of their content.  I would like to motivate other sudents so that they, like me, never hesitate to fight for their dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1187227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay the application expenses for her studies for a Master's in Studio Arts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Manizales","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2012-09-06T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-06T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1639000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.33},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136583.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":136583.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":136650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430042084,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":136583.33,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":136649.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439710433,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-06T23:13:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":465170,"name":"Elena Pilar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ELENA PILAR tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad de estado civil soltera no tiene hijos, vive con los padres en la Ciudad de ventanas provincia de los R\u00edos.\n\nEs Integrante de la VRC BRUNIQUILDE, se encuentra ubicada en Recinto Calabi, Pertenece al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedican a labores Agr\u00edcolas.\n\nELENA PILAR se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz.

Because the income her husband generated was insufficient to meet all household expenses she decided to open her own business so that she could contribute economically to the family while still being able to watch her children.  This is how she set up a general store at home where she stocks basic staples for her customers and thanks to this her family\u2019s quality of life has been improving.  She hopes to be able to overcome her home\u2019s economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe greatest opportunity this business has afforded her is to be able to provide her children with access to a better quality education and this is why she works hard every day so that it will continue providing her family with better possibilities.  Aiming at increasing the variety of products she has in stock, Luz Adriana is looking for financing to buy basic staple items and thus offer more variety to her customers.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to move the business forward so that she can provide a better quality of life for her family and to have better financial wherewithal for their support.  In addition, she hopes in future that it will be a source of income that will lead to her reaching her greatest dream: to get a house of her own for her
