She says her favorite pastime is to go for a run in the afternoons to relive a bit of the stress of going from place to place.  She belongs to a group called el Moralito and says that they chose this name because it is the name of the neighborhood where they live and meet.  she tells us that she sells underwear such as men\u2019s' socks, ankle socks, boys' and girls' socks, thongs, ladies' panties, men\u2019s' boxers, etc.  She has had this business for over 2 years and her sales have been very good. She has customers who place wholesale orders since she gets her stock in Mexico City at the factories where the clothes are made and she gets a better price.  She says that every 15 days she goes to purchase additional stock, since she also makes sales at a small stand she has at a market near her neighborhood on Sundays. She is requesting this loan to purchase more stock and she also wants to set up a larger stand on Thursdays when there is a local market, in order to increase earnings.  She tells us that her dream is to set up a stable business so that she can spend more time with her 3 children, who are all in primary school.  The other 9 members of the group are Juana Guadalupe, Rosa Isela, Maria Felicitas, Oliva, Ana Lilia, Mar\u00eda Virginia, Beatriz, Pablo and Mar\u00eda Elena.

catalogue, to stock up on fried foods, candy, ingredients to make hot cakes, filled churros to sell at fairs, toys to sell at fairs, and ingredients to make hamburgers and hot dogs.

Each of them has a business: Micaela sells clothing; Sandra sells craft items; Reyna sells chicken; Felipe sells bread; and Elodia sells fruit. This group is located in the community of Acatlan de P\u00e9rez Figueroa, where there is a lot of commerce because the people in nearby towns come down to this town to do their shopping.\r\n\r\nMicaela explains that she only finished primary school because her parents couldn\u2019t provide her with more schooling. So, she learned to do housework from the time she was very young, and her parents taught her that she would only get ahead through hard work. She is a single mother and says that since the time she became a mother she has worked very hard to provide for her children. Five years ago she decided to open her own business selling clothing because she realized that she would earn more working in her own business, and she also has more time to take care of her children. She began selling clothing from her house, but now she has a store where she can show and sell her clothing. She is very happy because she sells a little more and her business is prospering. She will use the loan to buy a variety of shirts, shorts, pants, dresses, blouses, and underwear to stock her business. For the future she hopes to be able to give her children the opportunity to study for a professional career so they can have more opportunities to get ahead. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1207901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy dresses, pants, shorts, blouses, underweary, shirts, and t-shirts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ACATLAN DE PEREZ, OAXACA.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T05:01:31Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T05:01:31Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elodia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5637.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392193,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":3375,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3382.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120056,"comment":null},{"amount":145.76,"local_amount":1874,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1878.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068103,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284840,"comment":null},{"amount":332.46,"local_amount":4274.5,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4284.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199311,"comment":null},{"amount":46.78,"local_amount":601.5,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":602.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840214,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T13:54:53Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482144,"name":"Yashar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yashar is a 45-year-old man, divorced and bringing up four children alone.

She is 26 years old and only completed school through the third grade.  She is married to Jose Luis who is a day worker and they have two children.  Flor tells us that 4 years ago she decided to start her own business selling cosmetics and perfume to make a little extra money to help out her husband with the household expenses. She started out selling to family and neighbors, and little by little she expanded her clientele.  Today she doesn't only sell in her own community but she also goes to nearby communities to offer her products.  She goes out in the afternoons to show catalogs to her clients and take orders.  She then buys the products and delivers them to her customers.  She is very happy because her sales have given her an opportunity to provide her family with a better quality of life.  A loan from VisionFund will give Flor the opportunity to purchase a variety of cosmetics (lip liners, foundations, eye shadows, nail polish) and perfumes to continue making sales.

She is part of the \u201cEl Ayle\u201d group. She says that where they have their loan meetings is under a tree called an Ayle, and this is why they named the group that, so they won\u2019t forget the name. She explains that she has been in the group for several loan cycles and she is very proud to belong to a group because everyone helps out when one of them has a problem. She says that she has worked for more than 25 years cultivating and selling avocados. She also sells bell peppers, prickly pear fruits, and peaches that she cultivates. She studied through the third year of secondary school because her parents couldn\u2019t continue supporting her economically because she had several siblings. Imelda is married to Demetrio, who works in the Central Groceries market in Mexico City. They had 5 children, and 3 of them live with her. Their names are: Carlos, who is 18 years old and works and helps with the household expenses; Vanessa, who is 16 years old and is in high school; and Fernanda, who is 14 years old and is in secondary school. \r\n\r\nShe says she is requesting the loan from Vision Fund to buy fertilizers and insecticides. She also wants to buy an insecticide sprayer to spray her plants with insecticides because there is an infestation in her trees and she is very worried because this will reduce her harvest if she doesn\u2019t apply the insecticides in time to eliminate the bugs. Imelda learned this business because she has a piece of land that is very large, and also to help her husband with the household expenses. She says that she goes to sell in the central groceries market in a town near hers everyday. She gets up at 4:00 in the morning so that her fruit will be fresh so she can sell it fast and at a good price. She says, \u201cHopefully the lender can lend me the new loan so that I can save my trees and have a good harvest. I\u2019ve invested a lot of inputs in order to improve the trees.\u201d Imelda\u2019s goal is to continue planting more trees. She has 87 trees and she hopes to continue planting because this is the inheritance that she will leave to her children. The other 3 members of the group are named Ivan, Ausencio, and Julia. They will all invest in their avocado crops since they also work in the same type of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3200,"image":{"id":1214388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizers, insecticides, and avocado seedlings.

She lives in the Telavi District in East Georgia with her husband, Malkhaz. Lia has requested a loan several times from local financial institutions for a family business start-up but without any success. Her loan request has been rejected each time because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small monthly income earned by Malkhaz working as a watchman at the local factory. In addition, Lia works for local farmers as a daily worker to earn a small additional income. They earn in total 250 Laris per month which is hardly enough for food and everyday expenses. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nLia has requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved within the framewprk of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit with soft conditions for the country's rural poor who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Lia will purchase calves in West Georgia where the prices are lower than in her region. She will raise and sell them at a good price. This will increase her family's income and she will be able to expand her animal sales business. This new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve her family's living conditions.

is from a small village in the Vani district. She is 55 years old and lives with her husband, daughter-in-law and 2-year-old granddaughter. Her son works abroad and helps his family financially. The family runs an agricultural business. In particular, they have a nut garden and agricultural land where maize is grown. Besides this, Julieta has a pig and she takes good care of it. She sells maize, nuts, and piglets at the local open market. Julieta works hard to make some savings and to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, she plans to purchase a milking cow.

Her home is located in the city of Imperial which is known for its varied climate and its crop agriculture, especially cotton, maize and others.  Victoria is very charismatic and, especially, ingenious.  She started her own business selling sweets and renting clothing two years ago outside a rehabilitation center.  She came up with the idea because the rehabilitation center only allows entry to women wearing skirts; and one day some women asked her if anyone rented skirts.  After that she decided on the business and, through much effort, has been able to cover her education costs.

A lo largo de mi desempe\u00f1o acad\u00e9mico he encontrado una gran afinidad con los derechos humanos y me he dado cuenta que su garant\u00eda es fundamental para la sociedad, es por esto por lo que quiero dedicar mi vida a luchar por su realizaci\u00f3n plena. Considero que tengo todas las capacidades para ello, sin embargo, en este momento mi \u00fanico impedimento es el econ\u00f3mico.\nSoy autodidacta: aprend\u00ed ingl\u00e9s de forma independiente y para sostener mis estudios me he desempe\u00f1ado como docente de ingl\u00e9s en varias instituciones.

She is currently studying Social Work at the University of Antioquia through a PAES scholarship which was awarded to the best high school student in Colombia.\r\n\r\nLaura's goal is to get a master's in Human Rights from Harvard or the London School of Economics.  The Kiva support will help her pay for her GRE preparation courses, the TOEFL exam registration and application costs to universities, since she does not have the economic resources to pay for it.\r\n\r\nThis is her story:\r\n\r\n\"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.\" Mark Twain\r\n\r\nLike for many, one of the most difficult and important decisions for me was deciding what field of study to go into, as a life-long project, to find out why I am here.  Now, five years later, I could not be more proud of my decicion: Social Work.  To find the apex between what you love, what you are good at and what the world needs, is the luck of only a few.\r\n\r\nSince I was a little girl I have had a huge social sensitivity, belonging to youth groups, parishes, and having excellent academic results.  I was granted a scholarship for the best high school student, and that is when I decided to use my skills to study social sciences.  Throughout my academic career I have found much affinity with human rights and I have realized that its guarantee to society is fundamental.  That is why I want to dedicate my life to fighting for its complete fulfillment.  I feel I have the skills for it; however, at this time I am limited economically.\r\n\r\nI am self-taught and learned English independently.  To pay for my studies I have taught English at several institutions.  In Brazil I had the opportunity of working as an interpreter for the UN at the Rio + 20 event.\r\n\r\nMy grade point average is 4.2 out of 5 and I have much international experience.  The most important one was working for an NGO in Brazil, using my professional knowledge and helping change society.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of post-graduate studies applications overseas is equivalent to five months of work, without including the fact that in order to work as a student internationally, I had to take on many costs related to travel tickets, maintenance, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter I finish my master's and return to Colombia, I would like to work for a United Nations agency, managing research projects for development in my region.  During my undergraduate studies I had the opportunity to work on a research project with a UN agency, the PNUD about forced displacement in eastern Antioquia, and we designed an intervention proposal.  What I like most is the research aspect of social problems and how to apply it to concrete resolution of said problems.

She is very positive her business will succeed because she has regular customers, she has a good business site, and also because other GHAPE members are always buying from her to patronize her. From this business she says the community will benefit from regular supply and low prices.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she promises to educate her children, provide medication, pay other dues like electricity bills and food bills, and also to provide medication for her family in case of ill health. She also says she prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, education before loan disbursement, its help in the fight against HIV\/AIDS, and also because the loans given by GHAPE are paid conveniently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":230,"image":{"id":1213299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for corn and onions and to do some repairs in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

is married with seven children, two of whom are below the age of 15 years. They live in a four-room apartment at Nkwen Bamenda, in the North West region of Cameroon. She has faced many challenges in life which include ill health within her family, and also theft and fighting over property by her family members.\r\n\r\nShe joined GHAPE in the year 2003 and has taken and repaid her empowerment credit four times with the recent loan amount being 200,000frs. She says if given the new loan requested, she will expand her fuel wood business, improve her farm garden and raise pigs. She is very positive that her business will succeed because she has regular customers, she has a good business site, and also other GHAPE members are always buying from her to patronize her. From this business she says the community will benefit from regular supply, as well as low prices of firewood, vegetables and pork.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she promises to educate her children, provide medication, and to plow back some of the profit into her business. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate, education before loan disbursement, its help in the fight against HIV\/AIDS, and also because the loans given by GHAPE are paid conveniently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":228.6,"image":{"id":1213305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She is very positive her business will succeed because she has regular customers, she has a good business site, and also other GHAPE members are always buying from her to patronize her. From this business she says the community will benefit from regular supply, low prices and manure for farmers.\r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she promises to educate her children, provide medication, and to plow back some of the profit into her business.

is married and a mother of five with two children below the ages of fifteen; they live in a-seven room apartment in Bamenda, North West region of Cameroon. \r\n\r\nShe has faced many challenges in life, such as the death of a cousin, inadequate capital to start up a business, and the inability to afford education for the family. She intends to use this loan to increase her poultry farming activity by buying more birds, feeders, and feed. She will also buy koki beans and oil for the cooking of koki, and part of the loan will be use to purchase piglets. \r\n\r\nThis activity will help the community by providing quality poultry to the public; it will also enable the population to enjoy good quality koki and pork meat. She believes the business will succeed because of the high demand for fowl and ever-increasing demand for koki in the community. Also her longevity in the above activity is a reason for her to believe that the business will succeed. \r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan she will sponsor the children in school, increase her business, and pay for the healthcare of the family. Generally the living standards of the family will be increased. She prefers GHAPE loans because of low interest rate, education before loan disbursement, and also the loans given by GHAPE are paid conveniently.

She lacks the capital needed to open a larger business, but is applying for a loan to buy Irish potatoes in bags as well as beans, corn and piglets. She will also use part of the loan to paid the rent on her market stall. This will allow her to provide good-quality food at affordable prices to people who live in her community, and help them get this produce locally rather than by traveling a long distance. She believes her business will succeed because of the high demand for food in her community. Francisca will use the profits she earns from this loan to provide her children with medical care, and also to improve her family's living standards.

She will also buy fuel wood and part of the loan will be used to purchase the needed vaccines for the poultry farm. These activities will help the community provide good quality fowls to the public. It will also enable the population to buy wood without having to travel long distances. She believes the business will succeed because of the high demand for poultry and the ever-increasing demand for fuel wood in the community. \r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, Bright will take care of her house and increase her business. She will also be able to pay for healthcare for the family and improve their living standards. She prefers GHAPE loans because of the low interest rate and the education given before loan disbursement.

She is single and only has a high school education.  She says that three years ago she decided to start her own business to earn a little more money so that she could contribute toward her household expenses.  She started selling shoes through catalogs to her friends and neighbors, and gradually gained more customers.  She even goes out to sell in neighboring communities.  Brenda takes orders for her products.  She goes out in the afternoons to show her catalogs to her customers who choose what they like the most and, when she has several orders, she supplies and delivers them.  Brenda is happy because this business has not only given her the opportunity to earn money but has also allowed her to meet people and make new friends.  She will invest this loan in buying a range of shoes and catalogs so that she can continue making her sales.  Brenda hopes that this investment will increase her profits and, in the future, she would like to be able to set herself up in business premises where her customers can come to buy their shoes.\n\nBrenda is a member of a group called Jardines del Bosque which has seven members.  The members decided to give the group this name because it is the name of the place where they live.  The other members of the group are: Ver\u00f3nica, who sells snacks; Silvestra, who sell snacks; Hugo, who sells clothing; Reyna, who buys and sells scrap metal; Leticia, who sells tacos, and Castor who works as a carpenter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":1208035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Shoes","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy a range of shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ACATLAN DE PEREZ, OAXACA.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T15:20:33Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T15:20:33Z","loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ver\u00f3nica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvestra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hugo Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brenda Vianey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Castor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:30:36Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315392180,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120042,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068090,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284828,"comment":null},{"amount":625,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199135,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T17:14:29Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482311,"name":"Magaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magaret is married and blessed with four children under age 15.

La Chinita tiene una cocina de comida r\u00e1pida. En su actividad tiene ya ocho a\u00f1os \u201cCon mi separaci\u00f3n mi autoestima estaba muy mal, pero mi hermano fue quien me motivo para emprender un nuevo negocio. no nos decid\u00edamos ya que ten\u00edamos la idea de iniciar una est\u00e9tica porque yo hab\u00eda estudiado cultura de belleza, pero tenia que invertir comprar productos de belleza, herramientas para tratamientos de belleza y no tenia dinero en entonces, mi hermano quien ahora vive en Espa\u00f1a me comentaba siempre que cocinaba muy rico entonces fue como me decid\u00ed iniciar la cocina econ\u00f3mica\". Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n para iniciar el comedor tuvo que pedir prestado para comprar art\u00edculos indispensables, empezando por el lugar donde ahora tiene la cocina econ\u00f3mica.

Gloria or, \u201cLa Chinita\u201d (as she\u2019s called), is 48-years-old, divorced and had three children with her ex-husband.  Only one of her daughters who is still in high-school is dependent on Gloria.  \n\nShe has a fast-food eatery.  She\u2019s been in business 8 years already.  Gloria says, \u201cMy self-esteem was very poor due to my separation but my brother encouraged me to start a new business and we decided to do so.  We thought about opening a beauty salon because I had studied hair styling but we needed to invest in beauty supplies and hair care tools and I didn\u2019t have money then.  My brother who now lives in Spain always mentioned that I was a very good cook and that\u2019s how I decided to open a low-cost fast-food eatery.  However, in order to start it I still had to borrow money to buy the things that were indispensable starting with the place where I now have my business.  The place my business is in used to be part of my parents\u2019 house which passed on to be my brother\u2019s.  I asked him to sell it to me and he accepted and that\u2019s how I got my locale and started to remodel it into a low-cost eatery.  I learned to cook because I was always stuck to my mother when she cooked and did other things, like driving, which is what I enjoy doing the most.\u201d\n\nGloria relates that her only difficulty arises when prices shoot up and she\u2019s unable to buy the necessary ingredients for her meals.  This leads to losses in Gloria\u2019s business and often she can\u2019t raise the price of her food for her customers.  But thanks to the loan she\u2019s requesting she will be able to buy sacks of rice, beans, sugar and salt, among other ingredients and she\u2019ll also be able to buy new dishes and a blender because the ones she currently has are very old.\n\nWhen Gloria was asked what her goal was, she commented: \u201cI\u2019d love to make my eatery larger because it\u2019s very small and sometimes diners don\u2019t fit in the tables and they have to wait for me to be able to take care of them.  I\u2019d also like my daughter to finish her career and become a great teacher; I\u2019m going to support her as far as I can.\u201d\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":1207919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sugar, gas, beans, rice, salt, dishes and a blender.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JILOTEPEC","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-10-15T15:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-14T15:30:01Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2158.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3041.74},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3112.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3185.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3259.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3335.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3413.56},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3493.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":240.29},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":656.69,"local_amount":8312.51,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":8416.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323120050,"comment":null},{"amount":509.15,"local_amount":6445.02,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6525.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068097,"comment":null},{"amount":533.2,"local_amount":6749.29,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6833.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284834,"comment":null},{"amount":275.96,"local_amount":3493.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3536.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-18T11:13:35Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T16:37:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":480890,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Mario nos platica que tiene 32 anos de edad vive en union libre con la senora Rocio nos platica que tienen dos ninos, El tiene un ciber cafe desde hace tres anos nos platica que la inicio porque sus el estudio una carrera que iba caorde a su negocio cuando termino de estudiar el busco un trbajo pero no encontro trabajo sin embargo ya tenia una familia que mantener y tuvo que obtar por poner su propio ciber \"Inicie con cuatro maquinas, el local me lo presta uno de mis hermanos ya estaba perfecto parta convertirlo en un ciber cafe, esta vez solicite el credito pera comprar 2 computadoras mas me gusta mucho mi negocio ya que soy el unico que lo maneja no tengo un jefe que me mande, ademas tengo los clientes mas que un negocio pudiera tener en  comunidad ya que estoy en la escuelas ecuelas y el centro de salud, ya que ademas de dar servicio de ciber tambien doy mantenimiento a las maquinas, creo que no tengo gran dificultad ya que me va muy bie en cuanto la servicio.

Maritza is chair of the \"Los Rosales de Huasteca\" group, which is starting its second loan cycle with Edaprospo. \r\n\r\nMoritz has had a printing house for a year, where she makes books for primary and secondary schools.

Through two decades, Mark worked various jobs to support his family. But when he and his wife divorced 12 years ago, he had to work harder as he became a single father.\n\n\u201cOne day I was sitting down and I noticed for 20 years, I was working so much and I never made more than $20,000 a year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always done side jobs and one day I was thinking about how to make more money.\u201d That\u2019s when his son suggested entering the music industry.\n\nSolFear Records and Productions of McAllen, Texas, is a record label targeting musicians looking to sign a contract and produce music. In its two years of business, Mark and two of his sons have worked out of Mark\u2019s bedroom with at least 80 bands and created shows to raise awareness of McAllen\u2019s talents. \n\nMark recalls: \u201cMy son, who we call Fuby, said, \u2018You\u2019re not doing one thing you love: your music. You should be around what you love, before you think about what you make.\u2019\u201d \n\nThereafter, Mark opened a recording studio in his home. \u201cI had the magic wand in my hand, which was my guitar and my talent, and honestly, everything fell in place. I felt accomplished,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t just record; we copyright every song. Our label is trademarked so we don\u2019t have to worry about anything; we protect your music.\u201d\n\nMark began his musical journey when he was nine. His grandfather noticed Mark\u2019s interest and handed the guitar to him, and since then, guitar playing has been his passion.\n\nWhen first seeing various TV commercials and web ads, Mark was skeptical about Accion because he has a negative relationship with banks. But when he learned Accion is a non-profit organization, he decided to apply for a loan. Mark said the loan helped him gain financial security. \u201cI know how to make the loan work for us,\u201d he said. As a natural hard worker, Mark said, \u201cWhen you can\u2019t do it yourself, you have to lean on something, and this Accion loan is what I have to lean on.\u201d \n\nUncomfortable with investing large amounts of what little he could spare, he said, \u201cAccion is helping me get past those fears of risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccion has helped me beat my two-year business goal,\u201d he said. \n\nMark will use the loan for his grand opening. He purchased advertisement, including banners, food, and paid for live music to raise community awareness about the studio. The rest of his loan will go towards working capital. \u201cHonestly, now that we have this, I expect my business to increase 35 percent. People felt uncomfortable in our home. It\u2019s going to help a lot. And we also purchased a coffee pot and microwave for the longer nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as money goes, I feel I make more than I ever would as an employee,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSometimes I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d \n\nMark wants the business to be known as the SolFear Train. He said, \u201cThose who want to be a part of the SolFear Train, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a musician, just that you\u2019re a music lover, supporter, or one who uses music as a tool in life. As we move forward, you\u2019ll learn more about our label through news feeds. But like a train, we only move forward.\u201d \n\nThe label also donated to the Make a Wish Foundation.

Eduardo (left) from Laredo, Texas, was looking for a new job, he and his business partner, Victor, (right) discussed several ideas, such as child or adult daycare, security and party rentals, until they eventually agreed on vending. Both Eduardo and Victor are 25 years old and were looking for something that didn\u2019t require too much work. They strive to give the best customer service, which Eduardo credits with their success. \"Wolf Vending Company\" is currently running on its own by word of mouth.\n\nSince the Laredo business began January 1, 2012, it has been growing monthly. Eduardo steadily obtained his first five machines and began approaching companies by March. His company now operates nine machines. \u201cWhat we offer are canned sodas or bottled drinks. We also offer healthy to salty snacks \u2013 anything that has to do with snacks that\u2019re not hot or cold,\u201d Eduardo says. As a matter of policy, Wolf Vending Company keeps its vending machines well stocked and always completes repairs within 30 days. They also offer liability and workmen\u2019s compensation, meaning that if Eduardo or Victor were hurt while on the job, they are covered and their customers won\u2019t have to pay for any medical expenses.  \n\nFor now, Eduardo employs only himself and Victor. He says that when the demand for his machines eventually grows to at least three times as much as it is now, he will begin hiring others to offer more customer service to their clients.\n\nWithout a loan, Eduardo and Victor would have had to start their business with their own savings. The loan from Accion Texas Inc. was a blessing, he says.  \u201cIt took a load off our shoulders. Yes, we would have been able to afford it, but it would have been tight for our personal finances.\u201d He discovered Accion through one of his former supervisors, who recommend that he and Victor attend seminars presented by the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) in Laredo. Coincidentally, the Accion offices were housed in the same building! So the young entrepreneurs found a great new path to realizing their dreams of business success.\n\nEduardo learned a lot in the beginning, such as how to properly interact and speak effectively with business owners. \u201cWe probably changed our repertoire about 15 times \u2013 I\u2019m not exaggerating,\u201d he says.  Eduardo and Victor also had to learn how to fix their machines themselves, since they haven\u2019t yet found a business to do so."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":1208446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for a new face plate for one of his soda machines and to repair the other machines.

She has been a client of Edaprospo for seven years and works selling food in a private school.  She also sells Esika, Avon and Unique brand cosmetics.  She has been making these sales for 25 years.  Alejandra started out with the idea of selling these beauty products in order to increase her income because she didn't have enough money to cover her expenses.  As a result of her efforts and hard work, she is now able to cover her household expenses and is able to pay off any debts that she has.  In the past, she was a housewife but she started making these sales because she had to meet her family's needs. She used the loan to purchase cakes, cookies, snacks and ornaments that she will sell inside the school.  Alejandra is a member of the 'Los Siervos de Jes\u00fas' (Servants of Jesus) community bank which has five members.  She has been the group's president for more than one year.

She works more than eight hours a day, which helps her pay the cost of food and basic services for herself and her husband.  The loan she is requesting will be used for general maintenance of her personal vehicle that she uses in her work.  This helps her to travel as quickly as possible from place to place during work hours to the various public entities where she must file paperwork.    \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen\u2019s dream is to improve her earnings and have an office of her own where she can attract more clients and have job security.  This is the third time she has worked with IMPRO, but the first time with Kiva.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1215804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay the maintenance costs of the vehicle she uses for work.

Atyrbu is a 48-year-old widow with five children.  During Soviet times, she used to work as a tobacconist.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, she started to get involved in animal-husbandry and agriculture as her main source of income, starting with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, Atyrbu has managed to develop her business: she now owns three dairy cows and their offspring and she cultivates 3.28 hectares (8.1 acres) of irrigated land on which she grows potatoes and beans.  From this business, she makes close to 7,000 som (KGS) per month.\r\n\r\nAs an additional source of income, Artybu also sews traditional national items such as toshoks (blankets), seat cushions etc...  With her income, she is able to pay tuition fees for her son and daughter who currently reside in the capital city.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, she has turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  She will use her loan to buy young bulls for fattening and resale.  She plans to invest her earnings from this loan into further increasing her livestock headcount.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":860,"image":{"id":1216717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ozgorush village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T05:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T05:20:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atyrbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2014-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-04T09:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":10128.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458819,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10128.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013830,"comment":null},{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-16T23:19:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":482689,"name":"Ton's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ton is a resident from a rural area located in Kror Kro district, Cambodia.
