lives in the coastal town of Mombasa, Kenya. He is married and has four children, two of whom are in school. He is a water vendor, a business he started out due to the high demand of water in the populated area.

in a village not far from a city.  He's single and lives with his parents.  In 2010, he finished high school but because of financial limitations, he did not continue into higher education even though he finished school strongly.  Juraboy's parents are experiencing financial hardship because of their large family.  His parents need to get everyone on their feet.  Juraboy has been working in trade, selling men's clothing, for a year.  He buys his clothing in another city at low prices.  In the beginning, things were difficult because he didn't have any previous, relevant experience.  He hopes to overcome all obstacles and become self-reliant. Juraboy has goals, just like everyone does.  He wants to save money and study at university.  He wants to be able to work in a specialized field.  However, helping his family comes first.  \n\nRelatives recommended he take out a loan from Arvand.  With these funds, he wants to buy an assortment of men's clothing to increase turnover.  He is very grateful to Arvand for the support and understanding.

She gets the yarn supplies from the main market in the city and sells them in the town market. \r\n\r\nHeneo is doing great in her business. She supplies yarns to all the weavers in the village and close-by villages. With the gradual progress in her business, she is now able to refill her shop with various yarn and also stocks woven products like traditional women\u2019s wrap skirts and men\u2019s shawls. She also provides credit facilities for acquainted weavers and gets repaid later by the weavers. \r\n\r\nHeneo is planning to purchase more yarn for her shop with the Kiva loan. She wishes to refill her stock in the shop and is planning to make savings for the future. She is determined to let her children get the best education and is grooming them to be successful persons. Her only dream is to see her children successful in the days to come; with that hope, she is working with her heart and soul to make her dreams come true.\r\n\r\nThe other Nupi Lom group members are engaged in piggery, poultry, paan shop, and weaving. They are true to their words and believe in their dreams. They wish all the lenders a good life and prosperous years ahead. They say, \"Thank you, Kiva.\"\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1328235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more yarn for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-04-15T21:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-15T21:10:01Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neipi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenglhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heneo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naocha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneihat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thempi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengbem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T13:54:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":548153,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is from Kisauni, he drives a motorcycle taxi.

Her mother supports her in her business, and she receives further income from the salary she earns as a school teacher.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy a variety of perfumes. She estimates that the loan will help her to buy perfumes of a different brand with the aim of growing her business and satisfying demand. One of her future plans is to establish another business selling just clothes. Her short-term goal is to further expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1332952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of perfumes.

By buying these supplies to make different types of bread, the bakery will make more sales and as a result her income will increase. In this way she can satisfy the neighborhood demand. \r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to buy an industrial oven which runs on electricity so she can bake more bread since in winter she can only bake once a day because of the rain.

He has a three year old son and lives with his small family in a home that he bought from his aunt and uncle for a good price because he was young and a hard worker.  He has plantations and raises organic cacao, palillo (similar to the guava-tree), and coffee.  He works on the land he acquired with Esther, through the fruits of his labor in the first year as a couple.  At first he had some financial problems because he was so young, however after a few years he showed that age is not an obstacle to getting ahead.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a more fluid campaign he needs to be able to count on working capital so that he can hire workers from the area so that he can speed up the farm work such as weeding and harvesting the cocoa pods.  In order to improve his income in the future, he plans to start selling clothing and put his wife to work in this way, which is easier than working in the fields.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan through Kiva and he is very grateful for the opportunity and is committed to making his payments on time.  He would like a loan of 3,000 PEN so that he can replace the existing columns in his home with solid cement columns, hoping to improve his quality of life and his family\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1331743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to make home repairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-16T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-16T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":329.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":329.03},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":362.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":374.2},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":373.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":398.79},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":411.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":420.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.18},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.87},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.56},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":329.83,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":333.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530377,"comment":null},{"amount":128.87,"local_amount":329.03,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":332.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975405,"comment":null},{"amount":141.9,"local_amount":362.28,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":365.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996672,"comment":null},{"amount":146.56,"local_amount":374.2,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":377.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864154,"comment":null},{"amount":146.11,"local_amount":373.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":376.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352520,"comment":null},{"amount":156.19,"local_amount":398.79,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":402.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904341,"comment":null},{"amount":161.33,"local_amount":411.91,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":416.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090439,"comment":null},{"amount":164.86,"local_amount":420.92,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":425.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439777243,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-19T16:26:21Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549033,"name":"Blanca Lidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca tiene 44 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de tres hijos.

He lives with his parents, who are very proud to have a hardworking son.  Abrahan\u2019s main job is producing organic cacao.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a very young boy, he helped his mother with the smaller tasks.  Over time, he gained more experience and this helps him manage part of the land that belongs to his family.  In order to carry out the work of maintaining his crops, he must undertake the task of removing weeds.  This requires him to hire local workers who also help with the harvest.  Abrahan says that he finds the work very comforting because the gains in the end are dependent on his total dedication.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis main challenge at first was not having the capital to acquire seedlings to replace the trees that were no longer productive.  Once he was able to raise the necessary capital, Abrahan could proceed with his planting his crops.  This is his first Kiva loan and Abrahan is grateful for the trust that has been demonstrated.  He promises to submit his payments in a responsible manner.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 3,000 PEN, Abrahan plans to hire local workers so that the first round of weeding can begin.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":1331733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire workers.

lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, which has high poultry production and consumption. He has three children and has been in his current line of work for 21 years.  His primary income sources are milk, eggs and farm crops. He enjoys dairy farming and his biggest challenges are animal diseases and expensive animal feeds. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo because it gives loans to farmers at a lower interest rate and also provides training on micro-finance. His highest monthly expense is school fees, and he plans to use the additional income he earns from this loan to pay for his children's education. He owns one cow, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water or other items such as a sewing machine, TV, DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile

26, lives in the village of Ikalto in Telavi district with her husband, Zurab. The family owns a vineyard where Zurab grows grapes to make wine and vodka, which is sold at local markets. This is the only source of income for the family and is not enough to cover their monthly expenses. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n<p>\r\nNatruli requested a 2000 GEL start-up loan from Credo. Her loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisions providing start-up and re-startup loans with easy terms to country rural poor who do not have access to credit products, as they are regarded as high-risk borrowers due to low incomes. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her loan Natruli will buy clothes at wholesale, then sell them at retail in her village. Natruli is a very hardworking woman and will try her best to make her new business work. Part of her profits she will use for reinvesting and purchasing more clothes to develop her trade. The other part will be used to help cover monthly expenses and provide better living conditions for the family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":1331530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothes at wholesale and sell them at retail prices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Ikalto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-16T18:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-16T18:40:01Z","loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natruli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":147.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":152.85},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":155.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":159.73},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":168.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":173.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":182.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":188.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.24},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":82.63,"local_amount":134.91,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":136.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969157,"comment":null},{"amount":90.25,"local_amount":147.34,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":149.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749575,"comment":null},{"amount":93.62,"local_amount":152.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":154.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613483,"comment":null},{"amount":95.24,"local_amount":155.5,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":157.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857202,"comment":null},{"amount":97.84,"local_amount":159.73,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":161.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133854,"comment":null},{"amount":101.16,"local_amount":165.16,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107441,"comment":null},{"amount":103.24,"local_amount":168.56,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254993,"comment":null},{"amount":561.02,"local_amount":915.95,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":926.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019146,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T20:41:56Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":548369,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is 45 years old and lives in  Margibi county, which is the largest rubber-producing region in Liberia.

","en":"Mavzuna is a married woman with two children.  She is 23 years old.  She lives in the Khuroson region in the southern part of Tajikistan.  Her husband trades at the market.

She has been in this business for years now, and it keeps on growing. \r\n\r\nUmazi would like to apply for another loan, this time for KES 50,000, to venture into another business of a retail shop. She would like to buy an inventory of household consumables, wheat flour, maize flour, rice and sugar. The more items displayed at the store, the better; more items to sell will result in better profit. The profits from her business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and to pay the educational fees for her children. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":897939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock of household consumables, wheat flour, maize flour, rice and sugar.

Her biggest challenge is, \"shortage of animal pasture during dry seasons and diseases\". Animals on the farm have been given the names of  Maua and Samoo. She will use the loan of 62,400 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to buy and insure a dairy cow.\r\n\r\nViolet was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied, \"Because it gives loans to farmers at a lower interest rate.\"  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session. She replied, \"They are short term loans given by microfinance institutions to farmers and businessmen.\"\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Violet replied, \"The income from the sale of milk will help me educate my children and expand my other businesses.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Violet owns cows and poultry but does not own pigs, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household a mosquito net, solar power, and a sewing machine but does not have electricity, running water, TV or a DVD.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo

Mauna is one of them. The lady standing second from right with her hand raised is Mauna. She is 45 years of age and a very hardworking lady living with her husband, one son aged 24, and one daughter aged 20.who have, after finishing 10th standard schooling, been helping their parents.\r\n \r\nMauna has been running a dairy farm with five buffalos for the last 12 years. Her husband and son help her in nurturing the buffalos and the milk supply. The primary work of Mauna is to clean the buffalo shed every morning and keep the shed clean. Mauna gets 15 liters of milk daily and supplies it to a sweet stall in a nearby town. She gets payment from the stall owner on a weekly basis. Apart from the milk, she also extracts cheese, curd and ghee from the milk, which fetches extra income for her. Mauna earns a monthly net income of 6,000 Indian Rupees (INR) but it is not sufficient to manage her household expenses along with the fodder expenses for her buffalos. Therefore, to earn some extra income, Mauna has planned to utilize the present loan to purchase another two buffalos of an improved variety. Mauna has a dream of saving some money for the marriage of her daughter and son and  to construct a house. The other four members are Sabitri, Sudha, Puspanjali and Sudhansubala and they are have businesses like a dairy farm, a fancy store, and a general grocery shop, respectively.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for purchasing two buffalos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"LACHHIPUR, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Puspanjali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sudhansubala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mauna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T17:05:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":548911,"name":"Diakalia","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur  DIAKALIA est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 35 ans et vit avec son \u00e9pouse dans la sous pr\u00e9fecture de Ouelessebougou, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro.\nDIAKALIA n\u2019a pas eu la chance  d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

Aside from that, she has a small stand located in her parents' house. She's very well-known because of her sense of humor and charisma, which has caused her sales to result in the profits she needs. She has been in this business for about five years, although at first she felt like she was too shy for this line of work. In time she was able to build up her qualities and now she sells a lot, which she's very happy about. What she enjoys the most about her work is talking to the customers and making them laugh. She believes that the hardest part is having to sell under the heavy morning sunlight. That's why she'd love to have a snack store where she could work more comfortably and offer her customers a wider variety of products. On this occasion she'll request 1000 soles. She's thankful to the people who provide the loan she needs to accomplish her plans. On the other hand, she pledges to make her repayments in a timely fashion.\r\nWith the requested amount she'll purchase a larger quantity of snacks to offer her customers, such as cookies, bubble gum and candy, among other merchandise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1333513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase cookies and candy, among other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.62},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.94,"local_amount":154.86,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":160.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364578135,"comment":null},{"amount":60.5,"local_amount":151.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373530388,"comment":null},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":164.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":171.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975416,"comment":null},{"amount":68.43,"local_amount":171.07,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":177.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996682,"comment":null},{"amount":69.62,"local_amount":174.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":180.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864165,"comment":null},{"amount":73.54,"local_amount":183.84,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":190.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352531,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T15:20:05Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T09:04:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":542530,"name":"Hojalater\u00eda Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grupo formado por tres socias emprendedoras una de ellas es Ruth  mujer soltera de 39 a\u00f1os de edad tiene 10 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a vender sartenes a las diferentes panader\u00edas, reposter\u00eda  de su localidad los sartenes son de diferentes estilos formas y tama\u00f1os, para esta temporada tambi\u00e9n comercializa en la compra de cosechas de tamarindo, el cr\u00e9dito lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de sartenes de diferentes formas y tama\u00f1os, adem\u00e1s cosechas de tamarindo para esta temporada que se vende por la semana santa, Maria del Carmen tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de sartenes y Eugenia compra y vende cosechas de tamarindo.","en":"The group is made up of three enterprising members, one of whom is Ruth.

It is a group comprising of four women members (two members from the Hindu community and two members from the Muslim community) from the hamlet of Fokat Pada in the village of Gadramunda. The specialty of this hamlet is that all the inhabitants were landless and the government provided them with small patches of land free of cost to construct house for residential purposes.  It is located in the Nuapada district, one of the poorest districts of India. One of the members of this group is Chandrika who is standing second from left with her hand raised in the photo. She is an energetic lady of 32 years whose family consists of her husband, two daughters of 15 and 11 years and one son of 13 years. The elder daughter of Chandrika has already married, the second daughter is studying in class 9 and her son is studying in class 7. \r\n\r\nChandrika has been running a bakery factory in her house with the help of her husband. Her husband started the business 20 years ago with a small investment of his own. In the factory, bakery items like bread, roll, cream and toast etc. are being prepared. She has engaged four skilled laborers for processing and making the bakery items for which she has to pay daily from 100 \u2013 135 INR plus breakfast and lunch. Her husband also works in the factory. She supplies the products to retailers in nearby villages and vendors also regularly take the products from her. Chandrika says owing to better quality, design, packing and forms of her products, there is a lot of demand from the locals, but due to a shortage of stock she can not meet their demands. Chandrika earns a monthly net profit of 8,000 INR, which is not sufficient to maintain the family expenses, educational expenses of her children and business expenses like payments to the laborers etc. To increase the income, Chandrika wants to buy more stock of oil, dough, sugar etc. to increase her production level to meet the demands and grab her customers. So Chandrika is planning to use the present loan for purchasing raw materials in bulk, which will reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, and for making a new kiln. She also hopes to save money from the sale proceeds to provide a better education facility to her children and construct a new house. \r\n\r\nThe other three active members of the group are Fatma, Mumataj and Mangala who are doing mutton, fancy items and a vending business, respectively, hoping to provide better education to their children and increase their living standard.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for oil, dough, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Gadramunda,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phatama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mumataj","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandrika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mangala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":136000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":136000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T22:40:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":549018,"name":"Hugo Apolonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hugo un humilde habitante de Le\u00f3n, de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, casado, padre de 1 hijo de 26 a\u00f1os, independiente, de oficio comerciante, es due\u00f1o de  una pulper\u00eda.\nInicio su negocio con ayuda de un amigo quien le regalo $ 800, fue all\u00ed que decidi\u00f3 emprender su propio negocio de pulper\u00eda, ya que el necesitaba un medio del cual subsistir y generar ingresos por si solo, el dice que en su pulper\u00eda le va muy bien ya que es un negocio muy rentable y le genera ganancias a diario, este ha sido su primer negocio, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposa quien le ayuda a administrar su negocio, recibe otros ingresos como es el dinero que le pagan como administrador de una empresa, una de sus expectativa es hacer crecer su negocio para que le genere mas ganancias.\nHugo esta solicitando el financiamiento para comprar  un fr\u00edzer y comprar mas mercader\u00eda como arroz, az\u00facar, frijoles, aceite, etc. Con el objetivo de ofrecer m\u00e1s productos frescos a sus clientes,   el  estima que este cr\u00e9dito le ayudara a  comprar  todos los productos que aun no tiene en inventario y de esta manera poder satisfacer las necesidades de su clientela, uno de sus planes futuro es poder cancelar este cr\u00e9dito para luego volver a solicitar otro.\n","en":"Hugo, a humble inhabitant of Le\u00f3n, is 49 years old, married and has a 26-year-old son.

Lilabati is one of them. The smiling lady of 41 years standing at the extreme right in the photo and raising her hand is Lilabati. \r\n\r\nLilabati lives with her husband and two daughters, aged 15 and 13 years. Her family belongs to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. People from the BPL category live on less than one dollar a day.  Her elder daughter is studying +2 science, and the younger daughter is studying in ninth standard.\r\n\r\nLilabati has been running a general grocery shop in her locality for the last five years. This is the only source of income for her family. She started the business in a very low-profile manner with a small investment of her own. At that time, her monthly net income was around 2,000 INR. It was very difficult for Lilabati to maintain her family and meet the educational and other expenses. \r\n\r\nAfter formation of the group, Lilabati took the first loan of 10,000 INR and purchased some grocery items like potatoes, onions, oil, sugar, tea dust, etc. After six months, her business started its growth, and simultaneously her income was also increased manifold. With her second loan of 25,000 INR, Lilabati again purchased some more items, and customers started knowing her business better. With the third loan of 30,000 INR, she added a shelf to her grocery shop and made a counter table with glass to have a good look, which will attract the customers and thereby increase sales. \r\n\r\nDuring this period, Lilabati did an innovative idea by motivating a lady to start a tiffin center (lunches or lunches-to-go) adjoining her shop, so that she could sell oil, sugar, dough, potatoes, etc. regularly. This idea of Lilabati\u2019s was materialized, and she earned some extra income. \r\n\r\nLilabati\u2019s husband actively helps and supplements her business. Within a short span, Lilabati successfully was able to increase the monthly income level from 2,000 to 7,000 INR. Out of this, she was able to send her elder daughter to the capital city of Odisha (Bhubaneswar) for studying +2 science. \r\n\r\nAs per her statement, Lilabati was able to increase the variety of items in her shop, but not the inventory. She wants to increase the stock of raw materials. So, according to Lilabati, a portion of the present loan amount will be used to purchase items like rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc. for her general store, and the other portion will be used for extension and repairing of the storeroom. This will help her to reduce her purchasing and transportation costs, as she will replenish her stock frequently. \r\n\r\nLilabati hopes to save enough for building a good house for her family, as the present house is very small. She also has a dream to give a better education to both of her daughters. Lilabati, with a sentimental mood, expressed her satisfaction that she has achieved the total success due to the timely support of Mahashakti Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Subarni, Kanakamanjari and Sanjukta, who are running general grocery shops and tiffin stall businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1332013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase rice, wheat, lentils, oil, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T01:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T01:40:02Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilabati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanakamanjari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subarni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-04-18T04:21:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":548594,"name":"Tassie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 51-year-old Tassie.

She will use her loan to buy 40 bags of millet from rural producers in Ouelessebougou, Mana and Moridjambougou and very occasionally from local wholesalers.  She sells for cash or on credit to a retail customer base mainly consisting of consumers.  She sells from home, at the Ouelessebougou market and other surrounding markets.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping to make a monthly profit of 30,000 CFA francs which will be used in part to help her husband take care of the family's needs and repay her loan, while the rest will be reinvested in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":280,"image":{"id":1332776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy grains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-04-17T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-17T01:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisabethe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819635,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678530,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924161,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207370,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972016,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624687,"comment":null},{"amount":40,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20062.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439850722,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-17T08:10:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
