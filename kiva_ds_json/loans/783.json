During the school year she cares for her siblings in her house in the city, because her parents live in the countryside where there are no schools.  This way her siblings can learn to read and write.  Before, she used to rent out space for a beauty shop in her house, which overlooks the main square, but she finished that contract, so now she is planning to open a restaurant where she could sell home-made meals to the townspeople in her neighborhood. She knows that she can make this happen, because she works very hard embroidering aprons.  She tells us that she makes an average of 8 embroidered skirts a month, and makes good money for them.  \"The most difficult part is the art,\" she says.  Over all of this time, she has managed to acquire 3 sewing machines, industrial and simple, and she now has 3 years of experience.  She hopes to consolidate the business over time.  Now she is saving, and she hopes to quickly reach her goal.  This will be her 4th loan with MFP, and she awaits a small loan so that she can reach her goals.  In addition, she pledges to comply with the payment terms, as she did with her previous loans.  She is grateful to be a part of her communal bank, because all of the members are responsible people who support each other.  Once Vaneza receives your support, she will invest the money in the purchase of chairs and tables so that she can open her restaurant.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":996332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to

About 3 years ago, when she won a raffle, she decided that she would use this money to start a business selling clothing to the residents of her town.  With the money that she won in this raffle, she bought clothing and started to sell it to her relatives, friends and neighbors.  In this way, she was contributing income to support the household expenses.  Since then, Omaira has increased her sales, because of the good quality of her products.

Her oldest is in first year of high school, the next one is in third year of secondary school and the youngest is in fifth grade of elementary school.  The entire family lives in a Mazahua community in the State of M\u00e9xico that has mountainous terrain with lots of corn fields, vegetation and rivers.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n\u2019s activity is buying and selling clothes.  During the week she goes from house to house offering the clothes and if there\u2019s some items she does not have she takes the order and then travels to the state capital every Friday which is when the street market is set up and she can buy at wholesale for good prices and once she\u2019s stocked up on her order she returns home and once again spends the week going from house to house where orders were placed delivering the clothes.  She sells on installments.  When she delivers the clothes they agree on a date to pay and she returns on the agreed upon day to collect the money.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n has been a FRAC client for five cycles in which she\u2019s been very responsible and punctual with her payments.

For the past five years, Emmanuel has been working hard to manage his small business, which does metal fabrication. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Emmanuel has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy another machine to help him in his business. It will help Emmanuel to generate greater profits and pay school fees for his children. Emmanuel hopes that in the future he will be able to buy more machines and open up another branch of the same business. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Emmanuel who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for micro-loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":998072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

She is separated from the father of her children, and she lives with her children in her own house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells soft drinks.  To do so she has a refrigerator that she bought with her savings.  That is where she stores her drinks and keeps them cold.  Her business is in her own house, where her customers come looking for a cool drink.\r\n\r\nShe started her business a year ago with a loan from MFP.  So far she takes care of the business herself.  She likes her business because it allows her to be at home and take care of her young children, whom she loves very much.  Also, the income the business generates for her is to pay for the household expenses.  On the other hand, what she does not like is when it rains often; it makes it difficult to sell her product.  She depends upon a warm climate in order to sell.  She now has plans to increase the variety of her products with energy drinks and yogurt.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP.

Desde hace un tiempo la madre de sus 2 hijos los abandon\u00f3 y desde entonces ha tenido que salir adelante solo con ellos dos. Gabriel anteriormente estaba empleado en una empresa de estampaci\u00f3n de camisetas, y gracias a esto aprendi\u00f3 la actividad. Al ver que su negocio era muy mal pago decidi\u00f3 independizarse y desde entonces tiene su propio taller de estampaci\u00f3n y gracias a este genera los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar. En el taller Gabriel tiene gran reconocimiento por la buena calidad de los productos que ofrece, y esto ha hecho que sus ventas aumenten cada vez m\u00e1s con el paso del tiempo. Debido a que no tiene una gran capacidad de producci\u00f3n puesto que no tiene gran cantidad de herramientas de trabajo, Gabriel a veces debe sobrepasar su carga laboral y trabajar hasta altas horas de la noche, lo que hace que se desgaste y a veces conseguir algunas enfermedades. Con el \u00e1nimo de mejorar esta condici\u00f3n, Gabriel quiere comprar algunos implementos de trabajo que le permitan ser m\u00e1s eficiente ocupando menos tiempo, y de esta manera pueda atender a sus clientes que le piden grandes pedidos. Sin embargo, Gabriel no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar la compra de los implementos, por lo que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de herramientas de trabajo como marcos de estampaci\u00f3n y pinturas que le permitan realizar m\u00e1s estampaciones en menos tiempo y poder atender a los clientes que le realizan grandes pedidos.\n\nGabriel espera que de esta manera sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, pues de esta manera podr\u00e1 acceder a clientes que antes no pod\u00eda atender debido a su poca capacidad de producci\u00f3n.

Quite a while ago the mother of his two children abandoned the family, and since then he has had to find a way to move forward with his children. \r\n\r\nGabriel was previously employed in a business where they did t-shirt printing, and thanks to that he learned how to do this. His job was not well paying so he decided to go out on his own and since then he has had his own printing shop. It is thanks to this that he is able to generate the necessary income to support his household. In his shop Gabriel is well known for offering high quality products, which has resulted in his sales increasing more and more with the passing of time. \r\n\r\nGabriel doesn't have the capacity for large production because he doesn't have a lot of work tools. Sometimes his workload is too high and he has to work late into the night, which wears him out and sometimes causes him to get sick. With the desire to improve this situation, Gabriel wants to buy some work tools which will allow him to be more efficient and take less time, and also be able to offer service to customers who place large orders. However, Gabriel doesn't have sufficient capital to be able to buy the tools. It is for this reason that he hopes this loan will give him the opportunity to buy the tools he needs, like printing frames and inks that will allow him to make more prints in less time and be able to provide service to customers who place large orders. \r\n\r\nGabriel hopes that as a result his sales will increase considerably, because he will be able to provide service to customers who before he was not able to, due to the small production capacity he has.

To reach her house one has to walk astray in the mountains to reach it faster. Faustina sells jackets, cosmetics and firewood. She is widowed and her children are all married, but they still support her in her sales and activities, which she has had for the past 20 years. She says that despite her age she does not want to quit her business, because it is her life and she really likes selling. She is well known, appreciated and admired by her neighbors because she works hard at all times and all places. Despite her age she asks God to grant her many years of life to allow her to keep on helping the women of her neighborhood, so that they can be pillars of hard work for their partners and offer the best possible to their children. Faustina got several requests for firewood and she wants to distribute it in her neighborhood, but she lacks the necessary capital and is forced to apply for a loan to buy firewood.\r\n\r\nHer fellow group member is Se\u00f1ora Ingrid Yolanda, aged 35, who sells general medicine  in her neighborhood with her husband and their three children. She followed a nursing course before her marriage. She dreams of having a pharmacy and helping people to get better when they are sick, regardless of the day or the hour, so that they don't need to travel to the village to get better.

is a 28-year-old single farmer. After graduating from high school, Erasmus decided to work as a farmer.  \r\n\r\nErasmus rents a plot of land and cultivates corn, nuts, and cucumbers. To earn more income for his family, Erasmus has been selling fertilizer, vitamins and seedlings since a year ago. Recently, Erasmus needed to spend his money on his brother\u2019s schooling fees so he could not buy the stock in a large quantity. The limitation of capital drove him to seek a loan. \r\n\r\nErasmus used to be a member of TLM\u2019s group lending program. As he needs a larger loan now, he is requesting an individual loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM to purchase seeds, various kinds of fertilizer and pesticides. He is hoping that TLM will give him another chance to get the loan for his business

She lives with her common-law husband, Francisco who is a state employee.  They have three children, ages 16, 9 and 2 and they live in their own house which they bought through much effort.  Melita sells essential groceries which she transports along the Ucayali River to sell to different rural communities.  Sometimes she sells on credit, but most transactions are done in cash.  In the four years she has been in business she has attracted many customers.  Her husband also helps her in his free time.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it gives her extra income to take care of expenses.  Also, she gets to know other places and new people, while observing how her business grows through hard work.  What she does not like so much is having to be away from home and not being able to care for the children, but she knows that what she is doing is in their interest.  Through her efforts she is trying to give them a better lifestyle, doing all she can to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan through the MFP institution.

Fekrieh is photographed in a FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is a seamstress who makes all types of clothing for women, men and children. \r\n\r\nShe obtained her knowledge when she was 14 years old, when her sister stopped providing formal studies, and she decided to learn a skill that would enable her to get ahead. Thus it was that in 1971 she worked in a tailoring business for two years and later learned other procedures in a variety of tailoring businesses: she learned to operate industrial machines, she worked finishing articles and in all stages of tailoring for 15 years. Then 4 years ago she started her own business together with a friend who has a workshop in her house. However, she also does some work at her own home where she has a family sewing machine and meets the needs of her private customers who number no less than 40.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a great help since he works for an optical company and both of them contribute to the wellbeing of the family.\r\n\r\nDunia receives payment on delivery; sometimes they give her an advance payment of 50%, with which she begins the work Her garments are very well made and this has garnered wide recognition and attracted customers.\r\n\r\nCurrently Dunia is applying for a loan, her first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy a serging machine which will enable her to optimize her time and improve her finishing. With this loan she will resolve one of her pressing needs, since to overcast seams she now has to go to the workshops of friends who let her use their machines. Her future goal is to have a well-equipped workshop with a good infrastructure that will enable her to concentrate all stages of production and generate jobs for other seamstresses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":996492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a serging machine which will optimize her time and improve the finishing on her garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69284},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74789},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76534},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78320},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80148},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82018},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83932},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85890},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87894},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89945},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92044},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":69284,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":71908.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039216,"comment":null},{"amount":43,"local_amount":74789,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":77621.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651344,"comment":null},{"amount":44.01,"local_amount":76534,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79432.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140954,"comment":null},{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":78320,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81286.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100847,"comment":null},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":80148,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83183.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338470,"comment":null},{"amount":357.03,"local_amount":620925,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":644442.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395038,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T18:52:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387781,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is 43 years old and married with two children.

is 55 years old. She lives in a small village near Tbilisi (capital city of the country) with her husband, Levan. The main source of the income for the family is agriculture. They have a milk cow. Rusudan produces yogurt and sells it in village stores. \r\n\r\nAlso, the family owns a greenhouse with an area of 300 square meters. During winter and spring, the greenhouse is used for greens-growing. In summer and fall months cucumbers and tomatoes are grown there. All harvested products are sold in Tbilisi.

Silvana sue\u00f1a con tener un gran negocio, con continuar estudiando y ser una gran profesional y en un futuro forjar una familia.\n","en":"\"Enterprising\" is the best word to describe Silvana, a 19-year-old young lady who just finished a technical course in accounting and finance and who now, thanks to the people she met in that course, wants to set up a business selling merchandise such as clothing and jewelry in order to make money.  Silvana is from an area nearby her municipality, but she moved to the municipality of Yarumal to seek out better opportunities for progress.  She lives with her brother in this municipality and it's where she has started to plan her future.  Silvana wants to set up this business because the people she met in her course motivated her to sell merchandise.  Their main argument was that she would have a large number of customers to serve there.\r\n\r\nBecause Silvana doesn't have a lot of capital to buy the merchandise she will offer her customers, she's looking for a loan that will give her the opportunity to obtain clothing and jewelry merchandise in order to start her business.\r\n\r\nSilvana hopes that this will get her business started and that she will be able to make her own income and work with her brother maintain their home.  She also hopes to be able to contribute to giving her parents a better quality of life and better financial opportunities.  Silvana dreams of having a large business, continuing her studies, being a successful professional, and, in the future, starting a family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing and jewelry merchandise to start her business\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71175},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73184},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77374},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79558},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81803},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86487},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88928},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91438},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94019},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96672}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.91,"local_amount":142455,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":148587.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075639,"comment":null},{"amount":41.83,"local_amount":72740,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75871.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326730,"comment":null},{"amount":45.16,"local_amount":78538,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":81919.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432119,"comment":null},{"amount":94.65,"local_amount":164611,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":171697.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432779,"comment":null},{"amount":45.68,"local_amount":79441,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":82860.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640211,"comment":null},{"amount":103.55,"local_amount":180086,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187838.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029283,"comment":null},{"amount":49.59,"local_amount":86236,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":89948.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165454,"comment":null},{"amount":57.04,"local_amount":99221,"processed_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103492.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339547965,"comment":null},{"amount":55.59,"local_amount":96672,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100833.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097972,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T20:17:28Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:46:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":387183,"name":"Sofia Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el cant\u00f3n Rocafuerte se  re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal La Unidas Somos M\u00e1s.

Samuel sue\u00f1a con que su negocio se convierta en una gran panader\u00eda en la cual pueda atender a una gran cantidad de clientes, adem\u00e1s, sue\u00f1a con poder generar empleo para las personas que m\u00e1s lo necesitan y brindarles a su esposa y su hijo una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Samuel has dedicated a large part of his life to his bakery business.  Since he was very young, be began to work in a bakery in the town where he was born and that's where he learned this business.  He later moved to the city of Medellin, which is where he met his wife.  Currently, Samuel has become independent and, thanks to a cooperative program that was able to secure him some money, he set up his own bakery.  His business isn't very large at the moment, but his customers know that his products are of very good quality.  Because his business has been growing little by little and his customers are making bigger orders every time, Samuel needs to change his workplace to that he can make his products more efficiently.  As Samuel doesn't have enough capital to make these changes to his business, he hopes that a loan will enable him to make improvements on his workspace in order to make his products in a suitable environment that meets all the sanitary requirements.\r\n\r\nSamuel hopes that this will allow him to serve customers he had to turn away before because they demanded certain sanitary requirements that he couldn't meet.  Samuel dreams of turning his business into a huge bakery where he can serve a large amount of customers.  He also dreams of being able to employ people who really need work and of offering his wife and child a better quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to make

Nestor is known in his area for his experience and the good quality of his products.  That is why he has a fixed clientele, and they give him very good orders.\r\n\r\nCurrently Nestor has seen how his work volume has been increasing considerably.  It gets to a point that at times he is not able to respond to all of his customers\u2019 orders.  That is why Nestor is looking to buy a machine called a compressor, which will make his work easier and more efficient.\r\n\r\nHowever, Nestor does not have enough money to buy this machine.  That is why he hopes that a loan will give him the opportunity to buy the compressor, which will allow him to make his products in less time.\r\n\r\nNestor hopes that this way his income will increase considerably and that he will be able to take care of customers that he previously had to turn away.  Nestor dreams of having a big shop and of being able to generate employment.  He also dreams that his family will be able to have a better quality of life, his three children will be able to have a quality education, and that they can have financial stability in the business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy a compressor, which will allow him to make his products in less time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor Isaias ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71175},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73184},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77374},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79558},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81803},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84112},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86487},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88928},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91438},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94019},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96672}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.85,"local_amount":69302,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":72285.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075642,"comment":null},{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":71272,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":74340.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902371,"comment":null},{"amount":43.15,"local_amount":75044,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":78274.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326733,"comment":null},{"amount":44.38,"local_amount":77174,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80496.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432122,"comment":null},{"amount":92.43,"local_amount":160752,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":167672.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378161,"comment":null},{"amount":2.76,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":5006.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432782,"comment":null},{"amount":311.45,"local_amount":541656,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":564974.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T03:37:27Z","paid_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388165,"name":"Zinunula Community Bank Nansana Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For the past seven years, 29-year-old Jane has been running a general merchandise retail shop in Kampala.

A long time ago he began working as a laborer (loading and unloading trucks) in his town, and thanks to this work he met a friend who grows potatoes. The friend offered him the opportunity to sell potatoes, so that he could commercialize them in his town, and because of this, it has been two years since Rodrigo combined his work as a laborer with the sale of potatoes. Rodrigo sells his product in his town to the principal stores in the sector, and this has permitted him to meet a large number of customers who give him big orders.

Manuel used to sell fruit, however this did not get the results he needed so he began selling fried food from a cart, such as potato chips and 'patacon' (fried flattened plantains), amongst others. Thanks to this work, Manuel has been able to support his wife and their four children to the extent that two of their children can now enter university. Manuel works outside a college, which means he can sell to a large number of customers. \r\n\r\nAt the moment Manuel's fast food cart cannot keep up with the demand of his customers, which is why he is hoping to purchase a second fast food cart to offer his customers the variety of foods they are asking for. However, Manuel does not have enough capital to make this purchase, which is why he hopes to gain a loan which will give him the opportunity to purchase another cart and have somewhere to prepare a wider variety of fried food.  \r\n\r\nManuel hopes that his business will continue to grow so that he will be able to generate a higher income for his family. As well as this, he dreams of having a large food stall where he could provide employment for those who need it and in this way give them a better quality of life and financial stability for their children.

Currently her vendor provides merchandise on consignment, but she wants to grow and is looking for the way to buy with cash and in larger quantities as well as to work with different vendors.  For this reason she came to credikiva, her first loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy school supplies, clothing, sandals and other products, taking advantage of the season in which the students have spending money, which is a great season for sales and her income will increase. In the meantime, her goal to buy her own house is still standing and Candelaria works hard to achieve that one day, her biggest challenge is to have working capital to invest and get ahead faster.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulieta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulieta hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Carlos Mario sue\u00f1a con que sus padres puedan disfrutar de una mejor calidad de vida, y espera que con unos buenos ingresos de su tienda el se los pueda ofrecer. Adem\u00e1s, Carlos Mario tiene el sue\u00f1o de montar un gran supermercado en el cual pueda generar mucho empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas.\n","en":"Entrepreneurial and visionary are the words that best describe Carlos Mario, a person that in spite of that fact that he doesn't come from a wealthy family has had the strength to get ahead and gibe his parents a better quality of life.\r\nCarlos Mario used to work at a dressmaking shop, but he didn't want to continue to work there because he didn't get paid well. Since then he started a general store, in which he only sold vegetables at the beginning.  Because Carlos Mario knew how to manage his money, he saved most of the income and re-invested it in the business and now he also sells basic groceries.  Carlos Mario now has small savings and hopes to buy display cabinets to show his products at the store.  However, he doesn't have enough money to buy them and also buy merchandise to stock the store, so he hopes a loan gives him the access to a display cabinet and to buy basic groceries to stock it.  Carlos Mario hopes that this way his sales will increase considerably, because the store will be more presentable to his clients, who will be able to find a larger variety of products.  Carlos Mario dreams to see his parents enjoy a better quality of life and hopes that with the good income form the store he can offer this to them.  He also hopes one day to be able to own a supermarket and employ people with needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":996207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a

He has worked raising chickens for ten years.  He began helping a neighbor who was doing this work.  Then his neighbor gave him 50 chickens on credit so he could fatten them and sell them by the pound.  Later he got together with his mother and they bought more than 100 chickens, quartered them, and sold them.\r\n\r\nCurrently Wilian is raising chickens every six weeks, which are the days of production.  He sells 500 pounds already delivered.  He has his customers, among whom he supplies a hotel and stores in various communities.  He buys 110 chickens in a city that is 56 miles from where he lives, and manages to get 100 five-pound chickens.  To buy the chickens he has to leave the house at 6:00 a.m., walk three-and-a-half kilometers, and board a vehicle that drives him to the city where he buys the chickens.  He buys them once a week along with the feed to feed them.  During farming season Wilian works growing basic grains to sell and also works as the assistant of a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nWilian is requesting the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy 125 more chickens and feed to feed those he already has and those he will buy, because the demand is growing.  Once they reach their weight he quarters them, cleans them, and sells them by the pound.  He also will expand the farm for at least 50 more chickens.  In this way he will receive greater income, because he will supply all his customers and meet the demand.  With this income he will give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe plans to work very hard raising the chickens and work only on this, since this is the work from which he gets the most income.  He also wants to construct his own house because he lives in his mother's house.  He already has the plot of land; he only needs to build.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":990773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

de 58 a\u00f1os vive al sur occidente de la ciudad, donde tiene un negocio, que identifica una tienda y miscel\u00e1nea a la vez, pues en \u00e9l  sus clientes encuentran desde panes, pudines,  refrescos y en general pocas cantidades de art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n perfumes, ropa informal, chancletas etc. En su negocio Carmen vende a cr\u00e9dito y principalmente de contado a una clientela ubicada alrededor de su barrio, porque  se encuentra en una avenida muy reconocida, por ser un gran corredor comercial y esto potencializa su mercado. Con este negocio ella  ha logrado su crecimiento personal, el fortalecimiento de su autonom\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n la generaci\u00f3n  de sus ingresos para el sostenimiento familiar, formada por sus dos hijas mayores, que la apoyan y siempre han sido su fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n para trabajar persistentemente y salir adelante.  Su meta mas adelante es tener un local separado de la vivienda, para disfrutar de su sosiego familiar. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener el suficiente capital de trabajo para responder a su creciente clientela que permanentemente hace pedidos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 dulces, bebidas y refrescos, aprovechando que se acera una temporada de festividades y son los productos que mas se venden, lo cual garantiza el \u00e9xito de la inversi\u00f3n. Carmen en su negocio tiene una rentabilidad sobre las ventas no menores del 22%, una rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 8 d\u00edas y de inventarios tambi\u00e9n cada 8 d\u00edas, \u00edndices financieros desde los cuales se planea su crecimiento. ","en":"Carmen is 58 years old and lives in the southwest part of the city, where she has her business. She identifies her business as both a grocery and a miscellaneous goods store, since her customers find everything from breads, puddings, soda pop, and, generally, small quantities of items necessary for everyday living, as well as perfume, casual clothing, and sandals, etc. In her business, Carmen sells on credit and principally in cash to customers located nearby in her neighborhood, since she is located on a well-recognized avenue, a large commercial corridor, which provides her with a good market. With this business she has achieved personal growth, strengthened her autonomy, and also generated revenue to sustain her family, which is made up of two grown daughters who support her and have always been her source of inspiration to work persistently and to get ahead. Her future goal is to have a shop separate from her home so she may enjoy a calm home. Her greatest challenge is to have sufficient working capital to respond to her growing customer base which always makes orders. This is the reason for which she has turned to her first Kiva loan, the first loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Mario Santo Domingo Foundation]. She will purchase sweets, drinks, and soda pop with the loan, taking advantage of the coming festival season by stocking the items she sells the most, which will guarantee a successful investment. Carmen has a 22% retail sales profit in her business, her account charge cycle is eight days, and her restocking cycle is also eight days. From these financial indicators she has planned her business growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":997268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

She divides her time between making items of clothing, and selling 3 different types of goods. Her main business is the dressmaking, an activity she has been doing in the 20 years since she learned this art. She started out making bespoke dresses to the measurements of her friends and neighbours, and with the income from that she gradually expanded her range and her client base.

Her goal is to have a well-stocked, reputable shop in her neighborhood that everyone would know about because of its variety of merchandise.  Currently she sells items on a credit basis to select customers who have been loyal for some time.  She also sells on a cash basis when beginning a commercial relationship with shoppers.  Lately, Carmela has added a line of beauty products, cosmetics perfumes and varied merchandise that her customers order, which is doing very well.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to buy more of this type of merchandise but does not have enough working capital to respond to new customers.  So she is requesting a Credikiva loan, her first, through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which she will use to buy perfumes, cosmetics, and women's and children's accessories.  She believes this investment will be successful because it is based on orders made by potential customers who have been referred to her by good customers, and which she will handle with much care.  Carmela's accounts receivable turnover is 15 days and her inventory turnover is 12 days, with a profit over sales of no less than 38%, financial data in line with this type of business and which she uses to plan her growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy perfumes,
