She buys clothes of different designs from the market, in bulk, at lower rates and sells them in her community. She counts a good client list, most of her clients are her neighbors. She is a mother of three children, two of them are school-going. Zarka wishes to send the other child to school, but is unable to cover the expenses. She has gradually improved her business. Now she requested a loan of 40,000 PKR. She is going to use this loan to buy an ample variety of clothes in a larger quantity to add to her current ones. She intends to use the earned profits on her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":424.96,"image":{"id":1278073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy an ample variety of clothes in a larger quantity to add to her current ones.

She really likes being in the communal bank because of the group's camaraderie and solidarity.  She lives in the Paute canton, an area with a wonderfully mild climate.  In the canton there are various places to enjoy nature.  Its people are very hard-working, and they engage in growing flowers, agriculture, raising animals, and commerce.\r\n\r\nRosa is a woman who spends the most amount of time possible at her home.  She is 28 years old and married.  They have two children, ages eight and six, and the children go to a school in the area.  Her husband works as a day worker, and they live in their own house.\r\n\r\nShe spends most of her time taking care of her home.  As they live in the country, she raises chickens, guinea pigs, and livestock.  She also farms.  These jobs give her the opportunity to contribute to the household finances because they are profitable.\r\n\r\nShe used her previous loan to buy chickens, and she got good income from them.

From a young age he was left alone with his father when his mother died.  Since then, he learned how to work in agriculture growing corn and beans.  He also worked taking care of cattle for a family and still works at this job.  He gets up at 3 in the morning to milk the cows and to get to the place where the cattle are he must walk over some hills.  Jos\u00e9 is an enterprising man who also learned how to work in construction and how to make hammocks.  He has a chicken farm at home and he works hard every day; his wife helps him care for the chicks and to make the hammocks.  In order to buy feed and supplies for his chicks, he must go to a place that\u2019s a kilometer away from his house and he must walk there since there is no transportation available to that place.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for is to buy 17 quintals of feed concentrate to make 200 chicks grow; he will also buy metal sheeting and lumber to expand the farm and will use the rest to buy supplies to make hammocks.  With this investment, he will expand the farm making it more comfortable and the chicks will grow better.  Also, he\u2019ll be able to rotate the chicks weekly supplying demand from the businesses he sells them to earning higher family income.  His dream is to improve his house, install brick flooring since it\u2019s currently dirt and to build two bedrooms for his children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":426.84,"image":{"id":1280847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She works every day but makes most of her sales on the weekend as this is when people come from the fields to stock up with food to eat during the week.  Lelis has been in her business for more than 12 years and it allows her to cover her household expenses.\r\n\r\nLelis will use this loan to buy basic food products so that she can further stock her store.  She has been a member of her community bank for four loan cycles and likes it because of the loans which have allowed her to improve her store.\r\n\r\nLelis' dream is to continue expanding her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1281751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-02-01T09:18:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-03T09:18:09Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lelis Teresilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1080.85,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":90.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347069921,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T13:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355815987,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364526097,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:22:31Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372926866,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":180.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381703946,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":180.15,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-16T18:26:40Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":520317,"name":"Elsa Janeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal San Pedro De Pueblo Nuevo se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en la parroquia Pueblo Nuevo del Cant\u00f3n Santa Ana, lugar de gente honesta y dedicada a las faenas del campo y a la ganader\u00eda, con bellos paisajes campestres y gente amable.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Elsa, tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre  y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen un hijo de cinco a\u00f1os de edad el mismo que estudia en escuela.
