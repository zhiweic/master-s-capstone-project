Thanks to Zamira's hard work, her business now has 2 cows, a calf, and 8 sheep and goats. Monthly profits from the business are about 12,000 soms (KGS). Last winter was very cold and long, which resulted in livetock losses and a large increase in the cost of feed. So Zamira has decided to make a purchase a load of feed and hay, establishing a reserve as insurance against the risk of seasonal price increases. With this goal, Zamira has come to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 135,000 soms (KGS). Zamira will invest the income from the loan into paying for her older son's education, and subsequently, into developing her business."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1131761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase forage","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Savay village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-08T16:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-07T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1703.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425.93},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":447239,"name":"Haby","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Haby est une femme mari\u00e9e qui habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

She has six children, of whom two daughters and one son are still dependent on her. She has planted rice and raised pigs for ten years and supplements her income by selling groceries. She can earn around KHR 12,000 per day from her current businesses.\r\n\r\nSophat has been with VisionFund for three loan cycles and successfully paid back the past loans, while the other members of her group have been with VisionFund for two cycles.

In her free time, Martha likes to listen to music, and more than anything, to relax a little from the demands of her work. She only has a secondary-level education, but she would have liked to study business administration.\r\n\r\nMartha puts a lot of effort into her beauty salon, to which she devotes around 10 hours each day and serves up to 12 clients daily. She is very creative and above all, organized. Martha believes that this is why her business does well, and also because she is very friendly toward her clients.\r\n\r\nMartha is very grateful to Kiva lenders, and thanks to their help, she will be able to purchase materials for her salon, like good quality dyes, talcum powder, hair creams, wholesale shampoo, scissors, and hair clippers, among other things.

is a 32-year-old married man. He has a child who is nine years old. He describes himself as an aggressive man. He owns a lorry with which he provides transportation services to customers for example carrying luggage and their harvest such as cereals to various destinations. He has been involved in this business for 10 years. \r\n\r\nPhilip's business is located within a residential area and his primary customers are local residents.

is a resident of Changamwe, Kenya, and sells charcoal. She is a mother of five children, four of whom are in school. In this business, Mwanajuma sells charcoal and firewood. It was started four years ago.\r\nMwanajuma is applying for a loan of 62,700 Kenyan shillings to purchase additional stocks of charcoal. She has no other source of income and greatly depends on this for her living. The challenges in this new business are customers not paying on time and the high cost of transport, especially for a trader dealing with small amounts of stock, thereby reducing the profit margin.\r\nMwanajuma aspires to build a family house in the near future and to be a supplier of charcoal to other dealers. She believes her association with Milango and its partners will help her achieve this

He works about 10 hours a day and can serve up to 40 clients per day.  This is how he earns a living and above all how he pays the bills in his household, together with his spouse who works in a tire store.  He believes that his business is doing well because he is very friendly with his clients, and his fares for transportation are very reasonable.\r\n\r\nRobinson is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to the help they are providing him he will be able to make improvements to his house, as he will buy materials such as corrugated iron, nails and wood to repair parts which have deteriorated due to rain.

The more items displayed at the store, the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and the educational expenses of her child. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nNovie hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

From this seaweed is extracted carrageenan, a valuable substance used in products that need gelling, suspending, thickening, emulsifying and water-holding properties.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan worth 6,000PHP which he will use to buy materials for seaweed farming such as seedlings, rope and nets.\r\n\r\nFaustino works hard to support his wife and their four children, aged 16, 10, 9 and six years old. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Faustino hopes to further improve his business and maybe invest in a more lucrative venture. In addition, he aims to continually send his four children to school for better education and learning. He wants to put some of his income into savings for future use."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1133943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy materials for seaweed farming such as seedlings, rope and nets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Talibon, Bohol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10.149167 124.325","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T04:50:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustino \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":272.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":272.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.81},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":1363.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294309118,"comment":null},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":1090.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301364215,"comment":null},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":1090.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308123469,"comment":null},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":1724.51,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315358980,"comment":null},{"amount":18.25,"local_amount":730,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T09:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":761.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323511637,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-09T13:53:53Z","paid_date":"2012-12-18T09:45:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":446903,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda is a 32-year-old resident of Bohol, Philippines.

is Milagros, 53, a resident of Bacoor, Cavite, in the Philippines. She is married to Nelson and is the mother of three children, all of whom are already working. By the grace of God, Milagros has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to sustain her family's needs for everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMilagros maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer's prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers invest in as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Milagros is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will utilize the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMilagros dreams of being able to expand her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRowena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rowena earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the unit. Her store is adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, Rowena is requesting a loan of 11,000 PHP to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nRowena hopes to soon be able to expand and to give her children a good education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Bulganjargal, 30, runs a grocery store in a supermarket. She started her business last year and has earned a decent profit. Currently it is a main income source for her family. His husband helps her to run their business. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband and her daughter in the ger district, an area of city with no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

This is why she works hard every day in her dressmaking workshop, with the aim of improving her household income and making progress in life.  When her children's father abandoned her, Luz Marina started working hard in her dressmaking activities.  She was already familiar with this work thanks to a family member who worked in the same business and who she used to help out occasionally.  Thanks to the experience she already had, Luz Marina was able to start up her own workshop and provide dressmaking services to third parties.  Thanks to the good quality of her products, she currently has very good orders from her customers.  Owing to the fact that she doesn't have a lot of capital, she faces certain difficulties when people place large orders with her.  However, she now has the opportunity to take out a loan and buy the supplies and raw materials she needs to fill her orders.  She is also able to have her three sewing machines serviced.  This will enable her to overcome the problems she faces as a result of her lack of capital and she will be able to make progress in her business.

She has gained a lot of experience and dexterity in her business. She lives with her husband and her son in an area of the city that has no running water, minimal roads and spotty electricity. \r\n\r\nMrs. Enkhtuya owns a house that was built in the early 1990s and has never undergone repairs or renovations. In the last several years, the poor insulation has caused heat loss and emissions trough the house's walls and windows. This causes her to spend too much money on smoky coal to warm her home in the winter time. \r\n\r\nAlso, Mrs. Enkhtuya thinks using coal is very harmful to the environment, especially due to air pollution. This is why she wants to insulate her house. Now she needs some money to buy the building materials such as the foam, cement, bricks and rock wool for wall insulation. She is planning to do it within the summer months. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mongolia has the lowest population density in the world, it is one of the most polluted countries in the world. This is due to the long and cold winters where temperatures frequently go below -40C, even in the cities. Also, in winter, many parts of the country are extremely cold and are known to have snow storms.  Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm. Additionally, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the main reasons for Mongolian hard air pollution. In response to this, Credit Mongol offers Green Loans to their clients to make home improvements that reduce heat loss, improve heating systems and buy cars that use less gas. We believe that together we can decrease pollution and the harmful effects it has on the environment and Mongolians' health. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy some building materials to insulate her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1515.03,"image":{"id":1134061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Both homes and nomadic tents burn a lot of fuel and emit huge amounts of pollution every night from families just trying to stay warm.  <p>\r\n\r\nAs well, the extremely toxic smoke from cars is one of the major contributors to Mongolian air pollution.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

He sells it to the Uni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco to be exported.  One of the concerns that he now has is performing all of the most technical processes involved with coffee.  This way he would be able to take better advantage of the resources he has.  He would also manage better conservation of the environment and his land.\r\n\r\nIn order to begin to carry out this action he needs to do cleaning work and to prepare part of his farm.  He needs a loan to do this.  In the future Jos\u00e9 Romulo would like to be able to expand his house and built another one for his children.

","en":"Romualda and Benito, her husband, have been coffee producers for more than 15 years. At first they worked for other people as day workers, but with time and thanks to their effort, they were able to buy land, the same land on which they now produce their own coffee. Romualda splits her time between her domestic duties and her work duties on the farm, as for her it is very important that her children be well-attended to. During the last harvest, they were able to get 11 tons of coffee, which they took over to the \u201cUni\u00f3n Regional de Huatusco\u201d to be processed and exported. For the next harvest, they need to buy new coffee plants to sow and organic fertilizer.

Debido a que se aproxima la temporada donde sus productos se venden en mayores cantidades, Danilo busca un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar sombreros y dem\u00e1s productos de uso personal para tener buen surtido para la temporada.\n\nDe esta manera superar\u00e1 la dificultad de capital que tiene y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 salir adelante con su negocio teniendo una buena calidad de vida en su hogar gracias a los ingresos que este le brinda. \n","en":"Danilo is married and has two children. He would like to provide them with the opportunity of getting a college education, but because of the family's financial situation, this plan has run into some difficculties, which is why he keeps working hard in his business, so that he can offer his children an education.\r\nHe has been in the business of selling hats and other personal items for over thirty years, since he learned the trade at a very early age from his brother and that was how he covered his expenses ever since he was very young. His sales are currently very good, but the problem he faces is that he doesn't have a business location, which often makes it difficcult to get the business going. Since the time of year is approaching when his products are sold the most, Danilo is requesting a loan in order to purchase hats and other products for personal use, so that he is well-stocked for the season. \r\nThis will allow him to overcome the problems he has with capital, and he will be able to get ahead with his business while having a good quality of life at home, thanks to the income it will provide.

The situation has not been easy and in spite of the great adversity she has faced, she has always had the strength to keep going and provide her children a good quality of life and improved economic opportunities in order to get ahead. For six years she has earned a living making and selling handcrafted items such as bracelets, necklaces both fancy and simple, and other items. Thanks to this business she has been able to get her family ahead. The work takes up a good bit of her time and so she has not been able to share much time with her children. However, she has always been grateful for her business since it allows her to give them the necessary sustenance in order to keep them going. Because her sales have been very good, Flor is seeking a loan to allow her to purchase raw materials she needs for making her handcrafted items and so to fill the large orders her customers have placed with her. \r\n\r\nIn this way she will be able to overcome the difficulty of insufficient capital and have better income for her home in order to improve the financial situation. Her greatest yearning is to get her children ahead, providing a good quality education along with adequate housing and nutrition.

They do diverse activities such as general commerce, services, among others, for a living. When they heard of the benefits the institution could provide them, they decided to get together and create this communal bank, which will help them a lot to improve their businesses. Here we met Jazm\u00edn, who is 36 years old, is married and has 4 children from this relationship. Her children are 19, 18, 11 and 4 years old. The two older ones are studying in the university and the two younger ones are in school and kindergarten. Her husband drives a taxi. Our friend, apart from being a great housewife, also sells clothes of all kinds, like handbags and sneakers, among others. She sells door-to-door. She walks around selling from Monday to Friday, in the mornings or in the afternoons. She leaves the products on credit and she collects the money every week. To buy her merchandise and get supplies of products, she travels to the city of Guayaquil and they also send her merchandise from the United States, since she has family there.

She was the youngest daughter and, hence, devoted a lot of time to household duties.  Because her older sisters and brother got married and separated from the parents, she was involved in household and farming work.  After finishing school, Gulzada was accepted to a university and came back to her native village after her graduation, where she got married.  Her oldest daughter was born in 1990 and then three sons.  The family needs increased with its growing size.  In order to feed and provide her children with all necessities, Gulzada started to go to a market to sell vegetables and fruits.  Parallel to this, Gulzada and her husband have already started their own business of breeding livestock by initially buying a dairy cow for producing milk.  With this successful start, Gulzada was able to buy bulls, and the business grew due to the addition of offspring.  With time, having sold some of the livestock, Gulzada was able to buy a house and a car for her family.  At the present time, she and her husband are fully involved in animal husbandry.  Today, their business contains three bulls and two rams.  In order to further develop her business, Gulzada requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  Gulzada's oldest daughter is attending a Police School, and Gulzada's plans are to increase livestock headcount in order to be able to educate her younger sons as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":1132275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

","en":"Shamiykul is 59 years old, a widow and has five children.  During the time of the Soviet Union, she worked as a milkmaid at a collective farm and, to provide an additional source of income for her family, became involved in animal husbandry 22 years ago, having started this business with a sum of 8,000 som.  Thanks to Shamiykul's hard work, today her business contains nine cows with offspring and nineteen sheep, and the sales of milk yield about 15,000 som per month.  In order to further develop her business, Shamiykul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock.  She plans to invest part of the earnings from the loan into building a house for her son, who has limited

From 2005 to 2011, lacking any source of income, Gulkaiyr and her husband were forced to go to find work in Russia, where Gulkaiyr took any available job. Thanks to their hard work, the couple were able to save up enough money to return to their homeland. Upon arrival, Gulkaiyr bought a house and 10 sheep for fattening and resale, and found a job at a local school. Presently, she works as a history teacher while awaiting the birth of her third child. Her herd presently consists of 38 sheep, and sales of meat bring roughly 8,000 som per month.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue developing her business, Gulkaiyr has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to purchase clover. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her herd."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1132525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fodder for her sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kaindy village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulkaiyr","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20093.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095635,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":20093.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938712,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T12:07:46Z","paid_date":"2012-12-19T09:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":447101,"name":"Nigar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nigar is a 43-year-old widow and raises two daughters alone.

In order to further develop her business, Khadicha requested a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock for fattening up.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan paying for her daughter's

She is a kind, responsible, and hardworking woman.  She married 41-year-old Humberto 18 years ago and together they have four children who are still their dependents.  Their ages are 18, 15, 12, and 7.  She lives in the home she was able to build with her husband thanks to the effort they each put into their work.\r\n\r\nShe has a business selling groceries.  Every day, starting very early, she opens her store doors to serve all the customers who come to her business looking for products, knowing that they will find what they need.  Her store is the best stocked in the neighborhood and, in addition to that, her customers do not hesitate to buy from her because of the quality brands she offers and her wonderful customer service.  She remembers that when she started this business she did not have many products to offer and so she was not able to make good sales during the day.  This often discouraged her, but she nevertheless sought a solution; she saved up a small amount of capital and, little by little, she stocked her small store.  Now her sales are very good and 15 years of hard work have passed since then.  What she likes most about her work is sharing happy moments with her customers, talking with them, and seeing them start their days with a smile.  She finds that the hardest part is having to get up early to work in her store, but even when she feels tired, she knows that it is her job and she has to do it.  She hopes that her business will grow in the future and make her better income.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that since she discovered this microfinancier five years ago she has had financial support.  That is why she promises, once again, to make her payments on time, as she has with her previous loans.  She is also very happy to belong to her communal bank, as all of its members are very responsible and supportive. \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 2,000 nuevos soles to buy a greater variety of products with which she will stock her grocery store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1119780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase rice, sugar, milk, etc. to stock her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-09T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-08T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":310.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":302.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":330.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":342.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":348.57},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":365.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":229.89,"local_amount":613.03,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":613.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401977,"comment":null},{"amount":123.85,"local_amount":330.27,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":330.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456252,"comment":null},{"amount":128.47,"local_amount":342.59,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":342.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451916,"comment":null},{"amount":130.71,"local_amount":348.57,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":348.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447091,"comment":null},{"amount":137.08,"local_amount":365.54,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":365.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-11T23:13:16Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":445270,"name":"Katya Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Srta.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.
