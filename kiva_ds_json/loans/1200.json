Their house is in poor condition, so he wants to improve their living situation. <p>\r\n\r\nNabeela and her husband realize that they have to generate more income to pay for the construction that would be needed for their house. Therefore, Nabeela requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can increase his inventory and ultimately sell more jewelry. She hopes that they will be able to work on the house soon to improve the family's living standards.

Bindu operates a table where she sells fashion slippers in the Paynesville South area of Liberia.

The area boasts one of the best standards of living in the county, with affordable rents, good roads, access to water and lots of transportation options. \r\n\r\nShe is married and has four children between the ages of 4 and 14. Only three are currently attending school, and all of them live at home. She completed twelfth grade and is good at managing her business.  She describes herself as a good businesswoman.\r\n\r\nBindu has had a table business for the past three years. She works 10 hours a day, six days a week at her business. Her greatest challenge in business is that during the rainy season, she hardly gets customers. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use the loan to buy more fashion slippers for her business. She started her business with help from her husband, who sells charcoal. She likes her business because it helps her buy some items for the home. In the future, she wants to own a house.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to thank the lenders for supporting BRAC Liberia and its borrowers.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":143.98,"image":{"id":1416145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

\n\n\u00e9l antes era padre soltero; pero se volvi\u00f3 a acompa\u00f1ar. Su compa\u00f1era de vida se dedica \u00fanicamente a los trabajos  dom\u00e9sticos, a estar pendiente de sus dos peque\u00f1os. A parte de su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus hijos con \u00e9l vive su mam\u00e1, quien ayuda  a realizar los oficios hogare\u00f1os.\n\n\u00c9l se dedica a comerciar ganado bovino en  el municipio donde reside y en sus alrededores.

He wakes up at 4:30 in the morning to begin work. He cares for a pine tree farm and has to walk 45 minutes to that location. Twice a week he goes to find cattle to buy so he can sell them the next week. To do all this, he must cover long distances.\r\n\r\nHe used to be a single father, but he has since found a partner. She works out of the home so as to be available to their two children. In addition to his partner and their children, his mother lives with them, and she also helps with the household labor.\r\n\r\nHis primary work is selling cattle in the town where he lives and other towns nearby. He has four years of experience in the work, which he learned by following a  neighbor around when he was younger. When he realized he didn't have any other options for bringing in income, he decided to begin working at what he had learned.\r\n\r\nHe also receives income for caring for a pine tree farm. Before he began to sell cattle, he was a farm day laborer. The farm he cares for is about 3km (1.8 miles) from his house, which he travels to on foot. He works in the field from 6am to 4pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to purchase a pair of oxen and a heifer, which he will later resell. This will allow his family to meet the expenses for their basic needs and allow them to keep improving their overall situation a little at a time.\r\n\r\nHe plans to keep working with the foundation that continues to support him, borrowing greater amounts. With future loans, he hopes to plaster his home since it is made of adobe and isn't particularly secure. With future income, he wants to invest in purchasing more animals and putting them up for sale. He would like to have a good marketplace where he can buy and sell. He says that he can achieve all this by committing himself to redoubling his efforts, regardless of how early or late he has to work, and by not limiting himself to just one thing.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":195.11,"image":{"id":1418834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase a yoke of oxen and a heifer calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Isidro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":47.96},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2014-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58.26},{"due_date":"2014-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":60.74},{"due_date":"2014-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2014-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":78.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.26},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.06,"local_amount":46.06,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410090895,"comment":null},{"amount":53.46,"local_amount":53.46,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":53.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856891,"comment":null},{"amount":39.85,"local_amount":39.85,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":39.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429505157,"comment":null},{"amount":55.74,"local_amount":55.74,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":55.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716239,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T13:51:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":598969,"name":"Beatrice's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group is composed of two women who live in the same neighborhood.

His life partner also works with meat production chickens and egg-laying hens. Together they have 2 children, one of them is not studying and lives with an aunt, the second one is studying 4th grade and is 13 years old. Aside from his son and his life partner, his parents live with him.\r\n\r\nWilian earns an income for his family's sustenance by farming and raising meat production chickens. He has been working this way for 3 years and he learned this skill from his uncles who worked in this same farming branch for a long time. He used to help them manage the work and this is how he learned well and realized that in this way he could earn an income to get ahead. He also works farming basic grains (beans and corn). Before becoming a farmer, Wilian worked making clay bricks which he sold daily on the city streets. His life partner, his mother and his youngest son help him with his current farm work.\r\n\r\nHe requests the loan in order to purchase 100 chickens since the ones he currently has will soon be ready for sale and he doesn't want to be without product. He also hopes to invest the loan in purchasing 12 quintales (1 quintal = 100 kg) of concentrate feed, 6 of a starter formula and 6 of a finishing formula which should be enough to get his product ready for sale. The funding will help him have greater income and in this way help fulfill his family's most basic needs such as food, health, education and housing. He needs to purchase more chickens and to continue working.\r\n\r\nWilian says that in the future, he wishes to obtain a larger loan and with those funds settle all his loans. With the leftovers he would enlarge his chicken coops and improve the roof so that his chickens don't get wet. When the chickens get wet they become stressed and don't gain weight appropriately.

is a 43-year-old married woman living in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. Her husband has been manufacturing bearings for vehicles using die molds for many years. He buys steel scrap material from the market and puts it into high temperatures to melt it. The raw material melts under high temperature, and then he injects it into the dies to shape it. In this way he manufactures the bearings. He sells them in the market and makes enough income to contribute to his family's livelihood.\r\n\r\nShamim has three children and she barely manages to satisfy their needs. She is required to provide them with good food, health, and education. She needs to earn additional income to support her family well. She is in her third loan cycle with BRAC Pakistan. Currently, she has requested a loan to buy more raw materials for manufacturing so that her husband can increase his sales.

from Sierra Leone!

Two of her children attend school. \r\n\r\nKadiatu runs a food stand business at home; she sells rice, onions and cooking seasoning. She has been running this business just after her wedding. She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Kadaitu says that the main challenge to her business is price inflation and insufficient finance to expand her business.\r\n\r\nKadiatu has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as rice, tomato paste and cooking seasoning. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big table.

33-year-old Isatu from the Jui eastern area in Freetown. She is married with two children, aged 6 and 18 years old.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Isatu established her cookery business. She began her business because she wants to create income to educate her children since she did not go to school. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is a lack of enough capital to operate her business.\r\n\r\nIsatu requires a loan in order to purchase rice, cooking seasonings and palm oil to expand her cookery business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and increase her business. In the future, Isatu plans to open a restaurant. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1416248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She took a loan of UGX 500,000 to help her to top up on school fees and buy some insecticide.    \r\n\r\nHer major challenge is banana wilts, which destroy her plantation, and the competition in retail is stiff, so it does not yield much in terms of income to sustain the family needs.     \r\n\r\nHer major dream is to restore back her banana plantation, which is almost getting finished due to wilt, by pruning and planting fresh wilt-free  bananas.                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1055.77,"image":{"id":1416234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"To top up on the children's tuition. and buy insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monic","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jadress","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nuriat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Scovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ajjara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":650000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":650000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":649999,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":658310.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410880200,"comment":null},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":650002,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":658313.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983859,"comment":null},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":649999,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":658310.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635950,"comment":null},{"amount":293.27,"local_amount":749999,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":759589.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863388,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-30T13:58:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":599076,"name":"Fareeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fareeda is a 31-year-old, married woman.

She says that the main challenge to her business is that it is difficult to find time to prepare the cookery.\r\n\r\nAminata requires a loan in order to purchase rice, cooking seasoning, and palm oil, to expand her cookery business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and to increase her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Aminata plans to further expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1416283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Nelson vive en la Parroquia Valle Hermoso del cant\u00f3n Santo Domingo en Ecuador. Valle Hermoso es una parroquia rural en donde hay aproximadamente diez mil habitantes, es el escenario para los amantes de los deportes extremos, pues sus cascadas y r\u00edos son los recursos naturales m\u00e1s adecuados para esto. Es un sitio con clima c\u00e1lido y sus habitantes tienen un esp\u00edritu emprendedor impresionante, pues a pesar de la dificultad de transporte que tienen siempre hay una forma de generar recursos para cada  una de sus familias. No hay buses que llegan hasta este recinto, pues solo las motos tienen acceso por lo que la mayor\u00eda de personas salen los viernes hacia la ciudad, d\u00eda en el que hay motos que los transportan.\nNelson desde hace 12 a\u00f1os estableci\u00f3 su propio criadero de cerdos, actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1o en su hogar y cuando tuvo que buscar el sustento por s\u00ed solo, decidi\u00f3 emprender su proyecto de negocio propio al cual le dedica entre 8 y 10 horas cada d\u00eda de lunes  domingo pues sus clientes van hasta el lugar para comprar los cerdos sin previo aviso. El terreno donde tiene los criaderos es heredado pero no ha podido legalizar su pertenencia con las escrituras respectivas debido a la falta de recursos para contratar un abogado y hacer las respectivas gestiones legales que se necesitan. Por esta raz\u00f3n, Nelson ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a hacer el tr\u00e1mite de legalizaci\u00f3n respectivo y as\u00ed sustentar su patrimonio para evitar el riesgo futuro de que le quiten su propiedad. \nAdem\u00e1s Nelson podr\u00e1 comprar un cerdo adicional lo que le generar\u00e1 un ingreso extra que lo ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar su estilo de vida y a mejorar cada d\u00eda en la administraci\u00f3n de su trabajo. \nGracias a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa su crecimiento est\u00e1 siendo posible, pues no pusieron obst\u00e1culos para llegar hasta su casa y conocer de su negocio y los pormenores de la actividad que realiza aun cuando hay mucha dificultad para llegar hasta all\u00ed. ","en":"Nelson is a 30 year old young man. He is single and doesn\u2019t have children. He grew up in the country, where his parents taught him about animal husbandry and agriculture. Due to a lack of economic resources, he wasn\u2019t able to continue his studies, although with great effort he did finish primary school. Nelson lives in the Valle Hermoso neighborhood of the Santo Domingo canton, or district, in Ecuador. Valle Hermoso is a very rural area in which there are about ten thousand residents. It is a destination for the lovers of extreme sports, because the waterfalls and rivers are the best resources for that. It is an area with a hot climate, and its residents have an impressive enterprising spirit, because in spite of the transportation difficulties that exist, they always have a way of generating income for each of the families.  There aren\u2019t any buses that reach this precinct; only motorcycles have access to the area. For this reason, the majority of people head out on Fridays to the city via motorcycle. \r\n\r\nTwelve years ago Nelson established his own pig farm, something that he learned how to do at home as a young boy. When it became time for him to look for a way to support himself, he decided to undertake his own business enterprise. He works between 8 and 10 hours a day, seven days a week, because his customers could come to buy pigs at any time, without notice. The land where he breeds the pigs was inherited, but he hasn\u2019t managed to legalize his ownership with the proper paperwork due to a lack of resources to hire a lawyer and cut through the red tape. For this reason, Nelson is asking for a loan that will help him to complete the legal procedures and, in that way, support his inheritance so he can avoid any future risk that someone might take away his property.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Nelson will be able to buy another pig, which will create additional income. This will help him to improve his quality of life and improve the administration of his job everyday.\r\n\r\nThanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, his growth is possible, because they haven\u2019t dragged their feet in going to his home and getting to know his business and the details of his work, even when they faced a lot of difficulty in getting there."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":338.36,"image":{"id":1418749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to complete the legal procedures and to pay the lawyer in order to legalize the ownership of his farm land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T16:00:06Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelson Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86.49},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.21},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100.45},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102.76},{"due_date":"2014-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.11},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.05},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.18},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.21},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.24},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75.11,"local_amount":74.52,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":75.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320665,"comment":null},{"amount":86.05,"local_amount":85.38,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":86.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856351,"comment":null},{"amount":87.18,"local_amount":86.49,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059931,"comment":null},{"amount":90.02,"local_amount":89.31,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995260,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-26T02:43:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600615,"name":"Geovanny Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Geovanny ha trabajado y crecido en su negocio gracias a la intervenci\u00f3n de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le han brindado una atenci\u00f3n de calidad sin poner obst\u00e1culos para llegar hasta su lugar de trabajo para conocer como funciona y como es el d\u00eda a d\u00eda all\u00ed. \nSus ingresos mejoraron a partir del \u00faltimo cr\u00e9dito que obtuvo, sin embargo cay\u00f3 enfermo lo cual lo imposibilit\u00f3 de cuidar el ganado y al no haber alguien que lo haga, su negocio se debilit\u00f3. \nAhora ha logrado fortalecer su negocio y encaminarlo nuevamente, por lo que requiere un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para comprar vacas que le generen nuevos terneros y leche que le permitan a Geovanny incrementar su oferta. \nEl trabajo desde tempranas horas en la ma\u00f1ana hasta la tarde, han hecho que este joven emprendedor aprenda cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s de su negocio y de la buena administraci\u00f3n.","en":"Geovanny has worked and grown in his business thanks to the help of the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, who have provided him with high quality attention.

With her loan, she plans to buy ingredients, seeds, and small agricultural tools and to pay for the labor to maintain 0.5 hectares.

She is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that she can provide a milling service to over 300 families in her community. \n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Chibombo District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create a flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. Terry is already operating a small shop in the community and wants to expand by adding the maize mill as a service. \n\nRent-to-Own has done market research in her community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest maize mill is 11km away from Terry, but it is currently not functional. This means most clients have to travel more than 15km to a roadside community, and since most clients walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. \n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many business women such as Terry, as it allows for her to diversify her business. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill can be very prohibitive. Once she secures a loan, Terry will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment to her farm, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. With a maize mill, Terry can continue to build her business and better serve her community. \n\nThis loan will help Terry on the long road to building up her viable businesses that can provide for her and her family throughout the year. It is for this reason Terry is asking Kiva lenders to help her with the loan so that she can secure a maize mill as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":657.05,"image":{"id":1420036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for a maize milling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chibombo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Terry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":13200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5810}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":371.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1078.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":371.21,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2004.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962084,"comment":null},{"amount":185.61,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616077,"comment":null},{"amount":100.23,"local_amount":540,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":541.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841796,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-31T13:27:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":601573,"name":"Collence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Collence is 36 years old and lives in the farming region of Chibombo District, Zambia.

She is married and has two children, ages 9 and 26 years.  She began her business because she wanted to create her own source of income, instead of depending on her husband. In 2009, Koso established her general store business.  She works at the business from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nKoso requires a loan in order to purchase more items to sell, like cigarettes, biscuits, soft drinks and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her child's school fees and to buy a piece of land. In the future, Koso plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

is a Liberian.  She is residing in Buchanan, the capital city of Grand Bassa County.  The county is located by the sea and is known for their beaches and fish.  In addition, many logging companies are located in the county.  People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of 'fufu,' a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.\r\n\r\nLucy is 45, married, and has two children, aged 19 and 25.  Only one is currently living at home and attending school. Lucy has a shop, where she sells cold water, rice, drinks, and other goods. She has had the shop for the past 13 years.  On average, she works ten hours per day at her business, from Monday to Saturday.  She started her business with a little bit of capital from her husband. She transports her merchandise by taxi.  She cites too few goods in her shop, as her biggest challenge.  She enjoys the profit-making of the business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy more goods to sell at her shop, including clean water by the sack, rice, and drinks.  In the future, she would like to own a house.

","en":"Rakhimakhon is 48 and married with four children. She has a high school education. Her neighbours speak of her as a diligent and responsible woman. Her husband is a small businessman and her son and older daughter are working in Russia and send money to support their parents every month. Rakhimakhon's husband and children actively help around the house and farm. Her family is very friendly and they have very good relationships with each other.\r\n\r\nSince 2000, Rakhimakhon has been raising livestock and crops as the main source of income for her family, a business she began with 5,000 KGS. She has great experience raising and keeping cattle. Thanks to her hard work, her farm now includes two milking cows and six sheep, as well as 0.3 hectares of agricultural land on which she is growing potatoes, sunflowers and corn. Her agricultural work brings in about 10,000 KGS per month, which serves as the primary source of payment for her family's groceries and other everyday needs. The profits from her farm have allowed Rakhimakhon to bring up and provide for her children, and to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of further developing her farm, Rakhimakhon has turned to microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase cows. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further enlargement of her property as well as, in the future, to renovate the house in which she and her family live.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":281.34,"image":{"id":1416856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Baltagulov village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-08-29T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-28T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rakhimakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3708},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3209},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3291},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3374},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3460},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3548},{"due_date":"2014-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3638},{"due_date":"2014-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3731},{"due_date":"2014-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3825},{"due_date":"2014-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3923},{"due_date":"2014-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4022},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4125},{"due_date":"2014-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4229},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4337},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4447},{"due_date":"2014-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4560},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4676},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3897}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.23},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.27},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.44},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.12},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.46},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.86},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":3708,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3726.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410014124,"comment":null},{"amount":66.47,"local_amount":3209,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3225.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777187,"comment":null},{"amount":68.17,"local_amount":3291,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427024,"comment":null},{"amount":69.89,"local_amount":3374,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3391.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942586,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-27T16:50:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600904,"name":"Feliciano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Feliciano naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Paucartambo y vive junto con su familia en la misma ciudad, \u00e9l tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene cuatro hijos, \u00e9l es una persona  trabajadora y emprendedora que saca adelante a su familia con el esfuerzo de su trabajo entonces su actividad econ\u00f3mica principal es la venta de productos qu\u00edmicos como por ejemplo fertilizantes y semillas, \u00e9l es una persona responsable por ese motivo le invitaron a participar en el banco comunal \u201cLlapallanchis Llankasunchis\u201d y en esta oportunidad  requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s fertilizantes, \u00e9l agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales con mucha responsabilidad.","en":"Feliciano, 49, was born in the city of Paucartambo, where he lives with his family.

He went to school up to the 9th grade. He is married, and his wife dedicates herself to the needs of the household. He has three children, aged 19, 17 and 15, of whom two are in school. In addition to his wife and children, his sister-in-law and her baby also live with him. \r\n\r\nHe works as a mechanic in body work and painting. He learned this profession out of necessity, since his parents were not able to cover the household expenses, and for this reason they sometimes went for days without anything to eat. Thus he went to a mechanic's workshop and became an apprentice, and little by little he learned this trade. Currently, he has 30 years of experience as a mechanic in body work and painting. He travels on a bicycle to the workshop, which is 4 kilometers from his house, and he works from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he will buy a new compressor, which will be greatly useful in his work. Without one, he is unable to paint the vehicles he repairs; thus, he cannot finish the jobs himself and does not have that income to support his family. It is also inconvenient for his customers, because the vehicles are not repaired within a reasonable time. However, now he will be able to continue his work, thanks to the loan provided to him. \r\n\r\nHis dream for his children is to see them gain professional training, so that they can face the future and not suffer through what he experienced. With regard to his work, he would like to set up a large workshop offering a range of automotive services, but he recognizes that for this he will have to work twice as hard as he has done up to now.
