is a 33-year-old vigorous lady who has been stitching clothes for many years. She sews for the people of her community and uses the income to support her entire family. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns enough to lead a decent life. However, due to lack of available funds, she is unable to meet the daily demands of her customers.

Hace algunos a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 unirse con su pareja Gloria que tiene 33 a\u00f1os y es ayudante de cocina en un restaurant, con esta mujer Edgar ha formado un hogar con cuatro hijos preciosos quienes estudian en la escuela p\u00fablica y Edgar espera darles la oportunidad que \u00e9l no tuvo de culminar sus estudios hasta que sean profesionales. Edgar vive con su familia en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nEdgar trabaja independientemente desde hace 4 a\u00f1os en la crianza de cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, empez\u00f3 a trabajar en esta labor para conseguir ingresos adicionales a su trabajo, ahora se dedica m\u00e1s tiempo, sin embargo, es un negocio que est\u00e1 saturado ya que muchos habitantes de la zona se dedican a la venta de animales, pero Edgar tiene clientes que le buscan por el buen cuidado que le da a los animales y los precios justos a los que vende. En una anterior ocasi\u00f3n Edgar form\u00f3 parte de un grupo con el que obtuvieron un cr\u00e9dito en Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, en esta ocasi\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de forma independiente que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de cerdos y tambi\u00e9n pollos para as\u00ed incrementar su negocio y obtener mejores utilidades que le permitan brindar a su familia un mejor estilo de vida. Edgar afirma que la primera vez que trabaj\u00f3 con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa sinti\u00f3 mucha seguridad y se sinti\u00f3 respaldado por la instituci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la asesor\u00eda de su ejecutivo de cuenta que le ha ayudado mucho con consejos de c\u00f3mo administrar su negocio. ","en":"Edgar, 38, learned to work when he was a child as his family had limited resources and he could not continue his education after primary school. A few years ago he decided to marry his partner Gloria, a 33 year old kitchen assistant. With this woman, Edgar has created a home with four children who are all studying at the public school and Edgar hopes to give them the opportunities that he never had to study until they are professionals. \r\n\r\nEdgar and his family live in the R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo parish, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province. A province of Ecuador that in recent years has sustained a high level of growth. Its capital is a city that names delicious fruits and gastronomy as its most attractive and appealing offerings. It also counts on a considerable commerce as it has become a gateway of commercial exchange between the desert and coastal regions of the country. It also counts on various tourist attractions that along with the warn climate mean it is often frequented by domestic and foreign tourists. It is for this reason that the majority of its residents have set up some kind of commercial activity or service for residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nEdgar has been working independently for 4 years, growing pigs and later selling them. He started working in this trade to earn supplementary income for his work. Now he dedicates more time to it, however, it is a business that is saturated as many residents in the area sell animals for a living. Edgar has customers who look for him as he gives good care to the animals and sells them for a fair price.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Edgar was part of a group that obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, on this occasion he is requesting a loan independently to buy pigs and chickens so that he can grow his business and earn better profits to allow him to give his family a better quality of life. Edgar asserts that the first time he worked with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, he felt much safer and felt supported and by the institution through the consultant in charge of their account who gave him lots of advice on how to run his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":526.61,"image":{"id":1376014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pigs and chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T22:10:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Eulogio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.17},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.96},{"due_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":95.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":98.19},{"due_date":"2014-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":99.96},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":101.9},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.95},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.44},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.7},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":168.41,"local_amount":167.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565423,"comment":null},{"amount":86.58,"local_amount":85.9,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814460,"comment":null},{"amount":88.61,"local_amount":87.92,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320634,"comment":null},{"amount":183.01,"local_amount":181.58,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":183.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059899,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T15:31:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575774,"name":"Orlieta","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Orlieta tem 30 anos e vive na casa pr\u00f3pria com o marido e 3 filhos (2 deles v\u00e3o \u00e0 escola e a outra n\u00e3o tem ainda idade escolar).\n\tA Orlieta e o seu marido t\u00eam um estabelecimento de venda de produtos alimentares de primeira necessidade em sua casa, onde trabalham quase todo o dia.

Ana\". Most of the women live in Santa Ana, a very small village on the outskirts of Antigua Guatemala. All of their businesses have been verified by business advisors, who believe that each woman stands to benefit from the support offered by Fundacion Namaste Guatemaya.  In addition to a loan, Namaste provides coaching from business advisors who develop a detailed understanding of the borrowers business (see below an example of how much detail they have on their clients).  \n\nEach of the women in this group are hard-working entrepreneurial ladies that dream of growing and bettering their businesses. Most of them are involved in the production and selling of food. For example, one of them promotes her business on Facebook and provides updates on the new products she will sell in the near future. There is also a woman who sells corn meal (the only one in the area) and another who sells products by catalog. \n\nCarmen Lucrecia (2nd from left to right) is a 48 year-old single mom who went to school through 9th grade. She has two daughters, one that is already married who contributes Q400 ($53)  per month to the household income and a younger daughter that still lives with her. Her younger daughter also has a daughter and Carmen Lucrecia pays for her school. Carmen Lucrecia has been selling food at the park of Santa Ana for the last 12 years and has become famous for her garlic bread, a product she introduced long ago to differentiate herself from the competition. She calls her big delicious bread \u201cNeco\u201d and this is the main attraction for her customers. She will share this business with her daughters so they have a place to work and support their families as well. \n\nHer dream is to learn how to manage her income, separate her profit from her personal expenses and be able to save enough money to open a new place to sell food in the village of Jocotenango. Currently she has a profit of Q986 (US$130) and works 240 hours (US$0.54\/hour) per month. Her plan for the next 9 months is to increase her profit to Q1,665 (US$220).

They all are involved in the buying\/selling or production\/selling of food. In the early educational sessions provided by Fundacion Namaste Guatemaya prior to getting a loan, the group has demonstrated that they are motivated and very interested in learning how to keep control of their expenses and sales. The group also mentioned that previously nobody has taught them how to improve their business. Therefore they are eager to receive Namaste's Business Adviser monthly visit to quantify their business metrics and help improve their profits. \n\nLilian is 40 years old, a widow and is raising two kids who are under 15 years-old and are going to school (in the picture, you can see her 4th from left). Lilian does not know how to read and write and is living far away from her family. While she was living with her husband and raising their family, he suddenly fell ill and ultimately passed from an unknown illness.  They exhausted their savings on medical bills and were forced to sell all of their appliances to pay doctors and hospital bills. Widowed and broke with two kids to raise, Lilian moved to a place where she pays no rent and gets electricity from the owner. She started selling tortillas [corn flatbread] door to door and now she has a place to make them and sell them too. Until now, she has been producing the tortillas for lunch and dinner. \n\nHer dream is to be able to have enough money to buy wood and corn in bulk because it is cheaper and now with the rainy season, dry wood is very difficult to find. With these supplies, she will be able to start producing tortillas for breakfast to meet her clients requests. She wants to learn how to manage her money and separate and save it in a way that she can start purchasing all of the appliances she was forced to sell when her husband got sick. \n\nHer actual monthly profit is Q1,740 (US$228) and she works 170 hours per month (US$1.35 profit per hour). Her business plan is to increase her profit by 40% by adding an additional selling time and by purchasing dry wood and corn in bulk.

He says the main challenges faced are high import duty costs and competition form larger retailers who offer credit facilities over longer repayment periods.  Justine has requested a loan of $500 to stock and fulfill his outstanding orders.  He says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow him to supplement their household income, as well as other expenses and boost business capacity.

The man shown in the photo is Kousar's husband.  She has two cows and two buffaloes and sells their milk to many of her neighbors.  She also makes butter and cheese with this milk to generate extra revenue.  She looks after the cows and buffaloes and performs the task of collecting milk from them while her husband sells it to different places on daily basis. They feel pleasure while doing this business to secure their children\u2019s future.  \r\n\r\nShe has four children; three of them are going to school.  She needs to earn much more to meet their everyday expenditures including food, clothing and education.

is a 26 year-old business woman from Liberia.  She is single and has three children, between the ages of 1 and 10. Only two are currently attending school and they all live at home. Kullah completed grade 7 before starting her business. She describes herself as hard working woman.\r\n\r\nKullah lives and works in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County, which is located by the sea. It is well known for its beaches and delicious fish.  Many logging companies are also based in the city. Residents of the city love eating fufu, cassava based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.  Most people in the city are Bassa speakers, one of the indigenous languages of Liberia.\r\n \r\nKullah has a table business where she has been selling fresh fish for the past three years.  She works from 8am to 4pm per day at her business.  Her greatest challenge in business is low income. She intends to use the loan to buy more fresh fish. She started her business by selling for her mother.  She likes her business because it helps to support her home.  She hopes to one day to own a house.\r\n  \r\nShe wants to thank the Kiva lenders in advanced for their help.

With his shrewdness and dedication, it is possible he will take care of his family and be able to send his children to good schools."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.5,"image":{"id":1375029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy organic fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ishaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.543056 30.136944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":222,"posted_date":"2013-06-25T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-25T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390689670,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T09:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400480801,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410879952,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419983609,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429635719,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":81249.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439863169,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T10:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574531,"name":"Festus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Festus lives in the Litein area of Kenya.

Now Sam has applied for a loan of Ugx.1,300,000 to pay school fees for his daughter this term.\r\n\r\nSam's dream is to see his daughter complete the nursing course and maybe help him and the family in future after getting a job. However, this has always been a challenge for him because of the limited funds to pay fees. But he believes if Ugafode gives him a hand, he will be in a position to achieve his dream.

The members of Full Bank have businesses such as crafts, farming and freight transportation. Ed\u00f3n is a woodworker. He has been doing this work for about thirty years. He was a teacher. When he retired he decided to follow his love of woodworking, as it is a tranquil business that he can do from the comfort of his home. Also, from the money that he earns from his craft, he can provide for necessities that he can\u2019t afford with his retirement income. Ed\u00f3n needs this loan in order to buy wood supplies and some tools that he needs for his job. It is also not so bad that the winter vacation is arriving and many tourists will come to Villarica.

After high school, he worked and helped his parents since he is the oldest son in the family.  He now has a loving wife and three children.

The land that they farm was obtained in part by inheritance and in other part out of their own effort.  Because of this, they have instilled in their children the value of working hard in order to get a better life.  Martina has spent 12 years making a living through her own farming, which is the source of income for her family to get their basic needs and to be able to get ahead in life.  The land where they farm is a 1.3 kilometer distance from their home, and they get their on foot.\r\n\r\nRight now she is asking for help to buy fertilizer and manure for the upkeep of her recently grown corn and bean crops.

She lives sin the town of Dongu, and belongs to a group called El Posito. She says that they called it that because close to her house there is a water well (pozo) that supplies the whole community. She grows avocados, manzano chiles, peaches, and blackberries. She has two enormous plots of land with the fruit trees. She also says that in November and December she sells poinsettias, since one of her daughters grows them. Angelina buys them from her to sell in the state of a M\u00e9xico in different  street markets. Her husband is a beekeeper and on the land where she has her trees he has his apiaries where the bees make their hives and leave their honey. She helps her husband sell the honey. She says the best honey is dark, since the bees get it from the avocado trees. She also sells propolis, royal jelly and wax. She says that she really likes to help her husband care for the bees. Right now Angelina is asking for a loan to buy chemical fertilizer and manure and lime to improve her trees. They have to be in good condition so that her bees, as she says, can also be in good condition. The fruit she gets from the trees goes to the wholesale center in the town of Zitacuaro to sell by the bushel so she makes a little more. Angelina's dream is to have a stable spot in the wholesale center to sell her fruits and vegetables every day in season. She says she is grateful to VisionFund for giving her the chance to improve her orchards. The other members of the group are named Mar\u00eda del Carmen, Miriam, Diana and Jorge. They will invest in materials for their avocado, peach and blackberry orchards and in a small grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":1376269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy manure and chemical fertilizer and insecticide to grow avocados and peaches.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-06-25T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-25T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3600},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":272.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":545,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":7262.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840208,"comment":null},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698642,"comment":null},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390698643,"comment":null},{"amount":545,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":7262.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399944836,"comment":null},{"amount":272.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3631.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410227910,"comment":null},{"amount":817.5,"local_amount":10800,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419991759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T01:48:28Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T21:44:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574902,"name":"Mary Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Joy is 27 years old and single.\r\n\r\nShe earns a living by raising pigs in the Philippines.

Gabriela is from a town called Ocampo which is located very close to a monarch butterfly sanctuary which is a tourist attraction.  Every year tourists come to admire the butterflies that travel from Canada.\r\n\r\nGaby, as she is affectionately known, has a convenience store in her home.  She says that she started her business because there was no convenience store near her.  She wanted to make her own money so that she could help her husband with their household expenses.  Gabriela has been running her business for 13 years and says that she enjoys good sales.  She says \u201csince I joined VisionFund, my business has improved a lot because at first I only sold sweet treats and soft drinks, then I started stocking a little of everything.  Now I make better profits\u201d.  Gabriela says that she sells to most of her customers on account.  When she sees that people can\u2019t pay cash she helps them in this way.  She says that she is requesting this loan to buy soap, soft drinks, bread, milk, eggs, sugar, coffee, salt, beans, rice, cooking oil, light bulbs, toilet paper, disposable diapers, baby formula and many other products.  She goes to the city of Zitacuaro to buy her products from shops where she can get them much cheaper.  This means that she can sell them more cheaply herself.  She says that one of the reasons she set up her store was so that people from her community didn\u2019t have to spend money on transportation in order to buy the basics they needed to make their meals.  She says that her dream is to invest in fruit and vegetables and some cold cuts but that she needs a larger refrigerator for this so that the produce doesn\u2019t go off.  Gabriela is grateful to the institutions who will make her loan possible.\r\n\r\nAntonio, Edith Ver\u00f3nica, Esperanza, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Ma.

These rural poor people are regarded as 'high risk borrowers' because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Nargiz will purchase a car.
