The family's total average monthly income is 500 Georgian laris (GEL).\r\n\r\nNorair requested a loan to purchase a tractor. He will cultivate the family's land and sow various vegetables there. After properly performed seasonal work, he hopes to get a good-quality harvest and sell it for a good price. He will also use the tractor to provide seasonal agricultural services to local farmers and charge a service fee for the work. This will significantly increase the family's income, and the increased income will enable Norair to reinvest in the family's agricultural land to expand it and make it more profitable. With all of these activities, the family's living conditions will improve."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":1147751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family runs a small-scale agricultural business. They grow maize and nuts on a family-owned plot of the land and sell the harvest at Kutaisi Market. Total average monthly income of the family accounts to 300 Laris, including monthly social assistance paid by the government which considers the family to be living in poverty. Their income is hardly enough to feed the four-member family. \r\n\r\nIra requested a loan from Credo to start up a trade business. Her loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions extended to the country's rural poor. They do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the loan, Ira will purchase clothing at wholesale markets and sell it in Kutaisi with a price mark-up. She will take clothing to the local houses. In time, she will gain loyal customers and increase sales. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly increase the income of the family.

Dato is a widower who lives in the village with his 19-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter. He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for an agricultural business start-up but without success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nDato\u2019s daughter goes to school. Dato and his son work as agricultural workers in the village. They earn on average 150 Laris per month and it is the total average monthly income of the family. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable group category. \r\n\r\nDato requested credit for a start-up of agricultural business. His loan request was approved through a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides credit with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to mainstream credit because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d due to low income. With the received credit, Dato will purchase up to 30 calves. He will raise them over 5 to 6 months. He will take good care of the calves, as he has previous experience working with livestock.

specializes in handcrafted silver filigree jewelry. He would like to stock up on materials and purchase two kilograms of fine silver.\r\n\r\nAlfredo has been selling through NOVICA since 2005. This is his story:\r\n\r\nAlfredo comes from Catacaos in northern Peru. \"Catacaos is considered the City of Filigree. I began to learn this art when I was 11 years old, with friends who taught me little by little. I enjoy it because a jeweler's work is a delicate art. I was awarded a scholarship to study with a professor from Israel and was even offered the chance to teach filigree there. But I love Peru too much to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to thank you for this microcredit. With it, I'll be able to buy more quality silver and offer new designs to my customers. It will also permit me to give the artisans who collaborate with me the security of steady work. I send you a heartfelt hug and my most cordial gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Alfredo's silver filigree jewelry on the NOVICA

This is his story:\r\n\r\nNestor hails from Peru's Puno region, renowned for quality alpaca and sheep wool. He has been dedicated to the textile arts, a family trade for generations, for more than 25 years. When he first began to weave, he worked on the rustic looms he built along with other family members. Together they sold their creations at local markets until they were able to upgrade to more modern machinery, which in turn allowed them to develop new designs and expand their workshop.\r\n\r\n\"I started with a flat type of knit and little by little I ventured into creating collections with raised motifs that, for a long time, had been designs I had only sketched out on paper. Every year I learn more about new color trends, too, and so I have gradually been increasing the variety of designs I have to offer my customers. I wish to take this great opportunity of interest-free microcredit and use it toward the creation of my new collection. I feel like I finally have the time to dedicate to designing and knitting, rather than constantly searching for new ways of selling.\"\r\n\r\nUse the link below to view Nestor's alpaca apparel and accessories on the NOVICA site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.novica.com\/artistdetail\/index.cfm?faid=3463"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":1147843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to make a bulk purchase of yarn in a variety of colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":225,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2850,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323082683,"comment":null},{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332034585,"comment":null},{"amount":285.83,"local_amount":285.83,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-07T10:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":285.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340259499,"comment":null},{"amount":262.18,"local_amount":262.18,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":262.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347154308,"comment":null},{"amount":1645.99,"local_amount":1645.99,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1645.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381796033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T18:43:34Z","paid_date":"2013-07-25T08:49:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":9,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":452687,"name":"Nino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nino, 33, lives in Tskaltubo District, West Georgia with her four year old daughter and her mother-in-law.

Her loan request was always rejected because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nNino works as a music teacher. Her salary is the main source of income for the family, along with the income of Nino\u2019s mother-in-law from small scale agricultural activities. The average monthly income of the family is 300 Laris. Also periodically Nino\u2019s husband sends some funds to the family. According to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category.\r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from Credo to create a music studio, where she will teach music, in particular Georgian songs to local children. Also, the family plans to construct a greenhouse. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup capital with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, which do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith the credit received, Nino will purchase materials to renovate a room for her studio, as well as to purchase the relevant furniture for it. She will also purchase materials for the greenhouse construction. Nino\u2019s mother-in-law will grow greens and tomatoes in the greenhouse and sell the harvest at the local market. Nino will be busy in her music studio. The new business initiatives of the family, financed with the Kiva Start-up loan, will significantly increase their income and even double it. With this, Nino will be able to provide better living conditions to her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":965.58,"image":{"id":1147847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

Her partner is Aliardo, father of her two children, 9 and 3.\r\nShe sells beauty products which she buys from a catalogue and her main customers are her relatives and friends. She has achieved good results and has met many people that later become her customers. She has been doing this for almost 12 years, working always on her own. She also started selling clothes for children three years ago, although seasonally and only for special occasions and festivities. What she likes about her business is that she can manage her spare time and invest it in her young children, who she loves dearly and who are her inspiration to move forward. She also likes to have an income to support her partner with household expenses. \r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She is thankful for the opportunity of having a credit line to help her expand her business. She also feels comfortable with her Community Bank because the members are responsible and kind people. \r\nWith the requested amount of 1200 nuevos soles, Rosa will buy more clothes for children in various styles and will expand her stock of cosmetics and perfumes in order to offer more articles to her customers. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1145566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more beauty supplies to increase her stock and children's clothes to continue her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T14:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T14:30:07Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":179.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":198.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":206.45},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":210.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":222.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":143.54,"local_amount":362.62,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":375.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456441,"comment":null},{"amount":78.42,"local_amount":198.13,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":205.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452102,"comment":null},{"amount":81.72,"local_amount":206.45,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":213.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447275,"comment":null},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":210.46,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":217.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053176,"comment":null},{"amount":88.01,"local_amount":222.34,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":230.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-14T00:37:52Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":452729,"name":"Watta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet 32-year-old Watta from the southern area of Kandeh in Bo, Sierra Leone.

is married and has two children, one of whom goes to school.

43-year-old Isatu from Kandeh town, southern area in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is married with six children between the ages of 7 years and 25 years. Five of her children are currently attending school. In 2002, Isata established her local foodstuffs business. She began her business because she was an agriculturist and her husband is a security guard but their income is not enough to support their family. She started selling palm oil, cassava couscous and rice to earn more income. She works at her business every day except holidays. She wakes up 5:00 in the morning in search of palm oil in the nearby villages. She says that the main challenges to her business are competition in the market and poor road networks in the villages.\r\n\r\nIsata requires a loan in order to buy more palm oil, rice, and cassava couscous. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and improve their family welfare. In the future, Isata plans to open a palm oil store. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1147977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The area is famous for its handmade fabrics, majolica ceramics and wood products. \r\n\r\nThirty-four years old, Catarina lives in a single-room structure with her husband, a tailor, and her two girls (11 and 8 years old) who are currently in primary school. She says that her biggest challenge is raising her girls, as she travels often for her business. Catarina enjoys cooking and spending time with her family whenever she can. Catarina is known as an outstanding member of her Trust Bank because of her positive attitude and good sense of humor, and also because she works hard every single day in order to give the best to her family. Catarina is so excited to get a new loan with Friendship Bridge after successfully repaying her previous loan, which helped to grow her business. Catarina's business is selling traditional clothing, which includes different types of huipils (typical blouses), typical skirts, belts, and aprons. As she wants to increase sales, Catarina is excited to use this loan to diversify her inventory of typical clothing so that she is able to respond to her customers\u2019 demands. She wants to provide the newest fashions to her customers, so she is happy to buy products from four weavers from different regions. By supporting the businesses of these other women, they too can sustain their families. She says, \"I seek for the common good, because we have needs from each other.\" Catarina currently sells in three different places, some as far as an hour away from home. She must get up at 4 am daily to prepare her products and transport them in minivans, buses and pick-ups. \r\n\r\nCatarina appreciates the education lessons Friendship Bridge provides at the monthly loan repayment meetings and finds them beneficial in achieving both her business and personal goals. Catarina's biggest dream is that her business will become self-sustaining so that it will continue to provide income, which will support her girls' education. Over time Catarina has improved her business's administration, all thanks to the business management training provided by Friendship Bridge. In addition, her first child is completing elementary school this year. Catarina is proud that she has been able to support her because of what she has learned through Friendship Bridge\u2019s curriculum that teaches parents how to support their children through school. Catarina only studied through 5th grade. She says that she can't imagine what great things her girls will be able to do if they continue their education. She wants her daughters to follow their dreams, become great professionals and serve the community.\r\n\r\nLike Catarina, the 11 other members of the Amistad Trust Bank, most of whom are also mothers, do business in textiles, clothing sales and tailoring, among other trades. They are so happy to be able to obtain another loan to grow their businesses, and thus continue to support their families. The 12 women acknowledge their financial support from people around the world and are grateful that they have opened their hearts to them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":1148020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To diversify her inventory of clothing.

Desde hace 5 a\u00f1os lleg\u00f3 a la ciudad de Cartagena y emprendi\u00f3 su propia aventura de negocios, vendiendo productos variados de necesidad dom\u00e9stica, pero su inclinaci\u00f3n hacia el arte la direccionaron hacia la lencer\u00eda, como hoy lo hace; ella fabrica hermosos cubrelechos, guardarropas, adornos de cocina, ba\u00f1o y comedor, que  vende a cr\u00e9dito y de contado, a clientes por encargo, mientras ella cada tres d\u00edas les responde. Denis atiende su negocio desde las 2:00 de la tarde hasta las 11:00 de la noche, sus clientes son principalmente mujeres, amas de casa y empleadas; ella quiere incursionar en un mercado menos dom\u00e9stico y requiere mejorar su proceso de acabado, esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 una fileteadora, una m\u00e1quina de fotograf\u00eda y materiales e insumos  como telas e hilos para el desarrollo y perfeccionamiento de su actividad. Con su credikiva planea lograr el \u00e9xito y abrir su oferta en almacenes y establecimientos comerciales, pues sue\u00f1a con ver sus productos exhibidos por todas partes y m\u00e1s adelante tener su propio punto comercial, pues ha programado que sus hijos termines sus carreras universitarias, y todo esto lo lograr\u00e1 gracias a sus esfuerzos y los de su c\u00f3nyuge, con quien est\u00e1 de acuerdo para potenciarle a sus hijos un futuro exitoso. ","en":"Denis is 42 and lives in Cartagena with her husband and two children ages 19 and 24. Her first business experience was selling merchandise in Guajira department, a beautiful place in northern Colombia. She came to Cartagena 5 years ago and started her own business selling various household items; however, she was more interested in art and started making fine linens, which she does today. She makes bedspreads, clothing, and kitchen, bath, and dining room accessories that she sells for cash or credit upon receiving the customer's order, which she fills in three days. \n\nDenis works from 2:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m., and most of her customers are women, homemakers and employees. She wants to sell to market professionals and needs to upgrade her finishing process. Therefore, she is seeking her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to buy an overlock sewing machine, a camera, and materials and supplies such as fabric and thread to develop and improve her work. With her Kiva loan, she plans to be successful and offer her merchandise to department stores and commercial venues. She dreams of seeing her merchandise displayed everywhere and eventually have her own store. She is determined that her children finish college, and she will achieve all this through her and her husband's efforts, as he agrees that education will bring success to their children.

","en":"Diana is 25 years old and a married woman with two children of the ages of 6 and 8 years old.  They motivate her and inspire her to work every day.  About four years ago, Diana began to sell informal women's shoes from a shop in her home, taking advantage of the fact that her husband is a maker of these goods, and little by little gaining profits, which allowed her to save up and buy a glass cabinet to show off her goods.\r\n\r\nHer sister is a technology student and taught her to use a computer and to access the internet, and there she found many opportunities to take the business knowledge that she has and use it to generate greater profits, increasing her income.  That is why she converted her living room into an internet cafe with two computers for the use of her nearby neighbors.  This small business had a large impact on her neighborhood, so she has added a transcription service, then more computers, a calling service, and video games.\r\n\r\nToday, she feels the need to increase the size of her business to meet her customers' growing demand and to obtain a better income.  Currently, her husband's business of footwear production is also a part of her daily activities, as she invests in prime quality materials and supplies and her husband creates the beautiful designs and fabricates the shoes that Diana sells to her customers.  She makes her purchases in specialty stores for cobbling and has three internet suppliers as well.\r\n\r\nShe is applying for a micro-loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy patent leather, heels, soles, and other supplies so that her husband can creatively develop a variety of sandals to the specifications of her customers' requests.  With this investment, it will be an opportunity to fulfill her customers' needs quickly and to slowly increase her sales, which has the end result of greater well-being for her family.  A goal that she and her husband consistently work toward."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1145658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"to buy patent leather, heels, soles, and other inputs to construct sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-07-24T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-23T17:40:10Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76213},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82269},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84188},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86153},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":88163},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90220},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92325},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94479},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96684},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98940},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101248},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109118}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.27},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.68},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.94},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.3,"local_amount":76213,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":76905.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395550,"comment":null},{"amount":46.75,"local_amount":82269,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83016.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775336,"comment":null},{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":84188,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84953.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387338,"comment":null},{"amount":48.55,"local_amount":85441,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":86217.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322994162,"comment":null},{"amount":50.49,"local_amount":88875,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:30:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89682.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130519,"comment":null},{"amount":51.27,"local_amount":90220,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91040.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519389,"comment":null},{"amount":52.45,"local_amount":92325,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":93164.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071233,"comment":null},{"amount":53.68,"local_amount":94479,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":95337.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497444,"comment":null},{"amount":54.94,"local_amount":96684,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":97562.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527268,"comment":null},{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":98940,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":99839.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928044,"comment":null},{"amount":119.53,"local_amount":210366,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":212278.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705231,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

She lives alone with her children who are in school, as her husband is working in the capital city and has forgotten about them. She devotes herself to carrying out domestic duties at home and making and selling traditional foods such as tamales, <A HREF=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pupusa\" TARGET=\"_new\">pupusas<\/A>, hot chocolate, fried yucca threads, and <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.postresdelacipota.com\/2011\/08\/nuegados-de-yuca.html\" TARGET=\"_new\">nuegados<\/A> among other items. She's been in this business for four years and believes it is going very well. She purchases all the materials she needs in surrounding villages which are 12 kilometers from her house. Her greatest difficulty is not being able to buy large quantities for lack of money. So she must spend more of her time because she must travel more frequently looking for what she needs to make her products. \r\n\r\nThe requested loan is for the purchase of four tables, a grill for cooking the pupusas, and raw materials, in hopes of establishing a fixed location because she now goes door to door selling her products and by order. Therefore she wants to set things up at home so her customers may come there and she may run the business better. She hopes to increase her income since her children are in school and the eldest is already at the university. Her biggest dream is to see her children with university degrees and that they would live a different life from the one she has, since for lack of economic resources she was not able to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. What she most wishes for is that this dream would become reality in each of her children, and so they have chosen to get some schooling. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":960.9,"image":{"id":1145689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase four tables, a grill for cooking the pupusas and raw materials.

She is married, 35 years old, and has two children, of whom one is in school and the other is a little girl who is just one year old.  Her husband has a regular job working for a company as a security guard.\r\n\r\nAlba is involved in the creation and sales of soft tortillas.  When she was very young, she began making tortillas in the mill where her aunt lived.  A regular day for Alba is one where she gets up at five in the morning to make food for her husband before he goes to work in the morning.  She then takes care of her children before beginning to prepare the corn which she will later use to make her tortillas.  She makes between a hundred and one hundred and seventy tortillas each day and her customers come to buy them at her home.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for will be for buying corn in bulk quantities while the prices are lowest and housing the corn so as to always have enough to make her tortillas.  If a part of her loan money is left over, she will use a small part of it for her daughter's first birthday to celebrate with a small pi\u00f1ata along with her family and the neighbor children.\r\n\r\nAlba didn't have a house of her own and was previously forced to rent, but with the previous loans she has been granted, and the bit more income from her business, and the income her husband brings in, they have been able to buy a parcel of land and have their own house.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to make a kitchen for herself and to have enough for her children's

She lives in the city of Ica in the district of Parcona, with her 2 small sons. Unfortunately due to several reasons she separated from her partner several years ago. She is a very friendly, hard working and enthusiastic person who dedicated all her strength to moving her family forward. She has worked since she was very young to support her parents and be able to cover her expenses. Because of this, she could not study for a professional degree but has liked being able to study nursing. In her free time she lives to spend a little time reading and sometimes when she visits her parents she cooks the delicious dish \"arroz con pollo\" (rice with chicken) to share with her family. \r\n\r\nBy her own initiative, Rosa works everyday providing cleaning services with a business in her city.

In this way Rosa will be able to have the necessary merchandise to begin her small clothing business and be able to receive income. She hopes to use this money to secure the education and well being of her small children. Her largest dream is to see them become great professionals and good men.

She sells general merchandise, new clothes for women, men, and children, underwear, shoes, sandals, and cosmetics.  She also sells chocolate bananas and \u201ctopogigios\u201d (ice cream).  She buys some merchandise on credit and some for cash. \r\n\r\nThe 5,000 lempira loan she is requesting is to buy new clothes to stock her business and increase sales.  The loan will also allow her to buy for cash and not have debt with the providers.\r\n\r\nHer goal this year is to work only with loans from ODEF.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1145475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy new clothes to stock her business and increase sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Calpules, Cortes","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2012-07-25T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-24T00:20:06Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorena Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":744.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":791.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":817.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":844.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":873.16},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":928.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.94,"local_amount":744.32,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":780.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301483090,"comment":null},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":791.35,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":829.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308476455,"comment":null},{"amount":44.98,"local_amount":817.73,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":857,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315477865,"comment":null},{"amount":145.56,"local_amount":2646.6,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2773.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323083232,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-07-25T15:22:40Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T16:07:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":453093,"name":"Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Concepcion is 48 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nConcepcion is in the agricultural business raising pigs in the Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEden hopes that her business will grow and expand through all her hard work on it.

lives with her husband and their two children, ages 12 and 7 who are both in school. They inherited their house from Gloria's father. She makes and sells pottery, an activity that she learned from a young age from her mother. Today she works to take care of her household from 8am until 4pm. The process starts by pulling the dirt, preparing it, setting the mud, scraping it, drying it, sanding it down, and finally firing the finished product. \r\n\r\nShe asks for a loan to buy dirt, nacaschol [a product used to make black dye] and firewood, which are needed to make the pottery. This loan will be very helpful to her because she'll have the basic materials that she needs to continue producing the pots, griddles, frying pans and other cooking utensils that are made from the mud called Loza. \r\n\r\nHer dream is through her business to be able to propel her children in their studies, because she wasn't able to go to school and she wants to see them become professionals so that they can have a better future and opportunities.

Altanzul lives with his wife on his small plot of the land in the ger district (ger is a Mongolian traditional nomadic yurt) in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His wife works as a receptionist in a hotel. Both of their salaries are low and usually do not meet their family's necessities. So, Altanzul also runs a taxi business on nights and weekends to earn extra income. \r\nHe owns an old, small house on his land plot and lately it has been in very bad condition and cold to live in. It was built about 20 years ago and it has not had any major renovation or repairs. In winter it has a heat loss through the walls and windows. So he sent his children to his parents in the countryside. \r\nThis summer he is planning to repair his house by installing wall insulation and building a small, one-room addition. It is very beneficial for his family to live comfortably and to stay warm at home. Every winter it costs much money to buy the coal to keep his house warm. He knows that it is harmful to his family's health and living environment. Also, he has a plan to build a small garage beside his home for his taxi car.

He lives in the Mi \u00danica Esperanza neighborhood in San Pedro Sula.  Elder has over three years of experience repairing motorcycles.  He used to work two days as an operator in a factory, and the other four days he worked in a motorcycle shop.\r\n\r\nOver one year ago he decided to establish his own business in order to get improved income.  He offers motorcycle repair services at customers\u2019 homes, and he also works at his house and sells replacement parts.  His customers are people who have routes (that is to say those who sell in an itinerant manner on motorcycles), private people, and employees of private companies.  They contact him by telephone when they need his services.\r\n\r\nThe loan he requested previously helped him a lot to be supplied with work tools.

She is married with Fernando, who is a mechanic, and they have three children aged 13, 9 and 3 whom they love very much. They all live in the house they have been able to buy thanks to their working efforts.\r\n\r\nShe sells women\u2019s girdles that she buys in the city of Lima where she has an aunt that sends her the products she orders; she then sells them to her working colleagues, as she is a teacher in a school of her town. She has been engaged in this activity for 3 years, and she sells on credit collecting it after 30 days at a max. She likes her activity because it allows her to earn another income on top of her salary, as in some occasions she did not have enough to pay for her expenses even though she shares them with her husband. In this way and also thanks to a loan she has previously received, she has succeeded in opening a small spare parts shop and she sometimes helps her husband who works there as a mechanic. She now wants to expand and improve this shop with more items to offer to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she is requesting to MFP and she feels deeply grateful to be able to count on this economic support to reach her goals. She also likes her Communal Bank because she thinks its members are responsible.\r\n\r\nThe 1500 PEN she has requested will be used to buy motorcycle spare parts and other spare parts to stock up her garage. She will also buy more women\u2019s girdles to carry on with this selling activity as well.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1145560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more women's girdles to sell and more spare parts to stock up her garage.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-07-25T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-08-24T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":228.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":224.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":247.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":257.87},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":262.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":278.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.85},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.78},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":173.62,"local_amount":452.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":454.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456439,"comment":null},{"amount":94.87,"local_amount":247.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":248.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452100,"comment":null},{"amount":98.85,"local_amount":257.87,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":258.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447273,"comment":null},{"amount":100.78,"local_amount":262.88,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":263.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053174,"comment":null},{"amount":106.88,"local_amount":278.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":279.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-16T11:18:01Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":453224,"name":"Gentian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gentian is married.
