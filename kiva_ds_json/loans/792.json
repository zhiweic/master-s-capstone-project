She deals in cash and credit, both at home as well as moving through the surrounding villages to a clientele composed primarily of women.\r\n\r\nKadia hopes that with this loan, she will be able to realize a monthly profit of 7,000 FCFA, which will be subsequently reinvested in the business and enable the addition of condiments for sale.\r\n\r\nAs with the other women of the group, her goal is to increase the volume of her trade through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1008941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase cosmetic products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou Markala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-18T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-19T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e8n\u00e8    Kadia     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140160,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757140,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251904,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251905,"comment":null},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410898,"comment":null},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449035,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T12:44:26Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393154,"name":"Asoiva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asoiva is a married 32-year-old mother of three.

is a member of the group called Mujeres Progresando (women progressing) group 2, located in the city of Samana. This is her 6th loan, which she will use to improve her house. She has had her business for almost five years. Since then she has paid back all her loans and expanded her business. After her last loan, which she invested in her business, Isabel realized the need to improve her home.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a Housing loan to improve her home by building another room, coating her house walls with cement and painting them. Esperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nYsabel is the mother of five children and she lives with them and her husband in their own home, which still need to be completely built (In the photo, Ysabel and her younger daughter are in the entry of their house). She will uses this loan to buy construction materials like concrete blocks, cement and others. \r\n\r\nYsabel thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity.

They are, on average, 40 years old and have 5 children each.  They live in the village of Bounou Markala, in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative district of Mali).  \r\nThe members of the group sell millet cakes, pastries, various grocery products (such as tea, candy, cigarettes, matchboxes etc.) as well as tubers and soap.\r\nIn order to increase their business, they have joined the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  This is their first solidarity loan.  Mawa, sitting at the far right in the photo, prepares and sells millet cakes.  She intends to use her loan to buy 3 bags of millet.  She buys millet at the Konodimini market.  To make a millet cake, millet has to be crushed, the husk is removed, then the millet is washed with water and ready to be ground.  The flour obtained is mixed with simple water and other ingredients such as sugar and yeast.  The obtained dough is then fried in oil and is ready to be sold.  Mawa sells her millet cakes from home.  She sells for retail and for cash, and sometimes on credit, to customers of both genders and all ages.  With this loan, Mawa hopes to see average monthly profits reach 15,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the activity and used to provide for her family.  \r\nLike the other women of the group, her goal is to have a multifunctional mill in the village, which would make the tasks of shelling and milling grains much less tiresome.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1008949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou Markala","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-18T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-19T09:10:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadji     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawa   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seli     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140161,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757141,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251906,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251907,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410899,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T11:38:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394077,"name":"Nasiba","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Nasiba 48 letnaya vdova s odnim rebenkom.

Dossa Emmanuel lives with his wife and children. The couple cover the various household expenses together. Dossa Emmanuel left school at primary level and then learnt how to sew, an activity which he has been carrying out with passion for around 15 years and which allows him to feed his family. He also raises animals in his area as a secondary activity. Dossa Emmanuel gets his supplies in Benin.

Nevertheless, she gladly runs the business.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, Asnat runs a piglet breeding business to earn extra income. She has been running pig breeding for years, even before running the motor taxi business. She plans to raise two more piglets to resell after six months but she needs a business loan to support her business.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, she submitted a loan application to TLM and requested a loan of IDR 3,000,000 to buy two piglets.

Unfortunately, he suffered a burglary at his home.  This situation discouraged him and he lost his eagerness to achieve better comforts for his family.  His wife suggested that she would help him and started working selling new clothing from street to street.  At first sales were good but her working capital was very low.

in the Khoost District of western Ukraine.   He has a son and is divorced.  Andryi rents a warehouse that has been re-equipped as a blacksmith shop where he produces exclusive forged products, namely handrails, gates, furniture, and various pedestals and stands.  Andryi is a talented craftsman.  None of his products are based on patterns, instead he approaches each order individually.  Andryi has no competition. His products enjoy strong demand and he has his own client base.  He has been in this business for 6 years.  His net profit is a little more than 6,000 hryven (UAH) per month.  \r\n\r\nA loan of 10,000 hryven is necessary for Andryi to buy bar stock and additional equipment (a vise) for his blacksmith shop.

He grows early vegetables, radishes, cucumbers, and tomatoes in greenhouses.  Leonid has a large piece of land, three large greenhouses (60 x 9 meters) and two separate greenhouses for seedlings.  He has been farming for eight years.  There are 100,000 hryven (UAH) invested in his farm.  Every year the cost of seed and greenhouse film comes to 36,000 hryven. \r\n\r\nLeonid needs a loan through Kiva of 10,000 hryven to buy 4,000 hryven worth of greenhouse film, 5,000 hryven worth of seed, and 1,000 hryven worth of fertilizer.

This is a place known for beautiful countryside and for people who work hard farming and raising animals.\r\n\r\nHere we meet Julia, 58, who is married and has 5 grown children. One of them still lives with her. Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe works together with her husband in commerce, selling all types of clothes. Every day they set up in a small stall on one of the roads in the canton where merchants are allowed to hawk their products. They work every day and their sales are highest on the weekend because those are market days and that's when people from the countryside come to the city to stock up on products. They buy their merchandise in Guayaquil or in their town when wholesale merchants come through. They've been working in this business for more than 3 years and it's their main source of income.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy all types of clothing so she can stock their store. She's been with the village bank for 5 cycles and like it because the loans have helped her a lot. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have good health so she can continue to make progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":1005542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Olmedo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263319439,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270034052,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646133,"comment":null},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321213,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208814,"comment":null},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":183.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":183.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335173,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T03:50:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394137,"name":"Mahuclo1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe MAHUCLO1 est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui sont des amies et appartiennent \u00e0 un groupe de tontine.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAnalyn maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8, 000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnalyn fervently hopes that her child will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1008670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":" To pay for merchandise items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3199.98,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3425.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275561,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2283.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997968,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2284.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606507,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":570.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095368,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T13:36:28Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393806,"name":"Riza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riza is a 44-year-old woman who lives with her husband and three kids in Bayan-Ulgii province in Western Mongolia.

The family lives in El Porvenir, a rural hamlet whose residents work exclusively in farming and cattle breeding. The hamlet belongs to the district of Olmos, one hour from the city of Chiclayo. It is located in a developing area and electricity is the sole public utility to which it is connected so far.\r\n\r\nJhony's activity consists in transporting passengers between the villages of the area. With the savings from his job as an agricultural laborer he bought a vehicle, which he runs from Monday to Saturday from early morning to late evening. His point of departure is in the district of Olmos, where he covers the route Olmos-Porvenir-\u00d1aupe. He has done this activity for the past four years and could thus support his wife and their two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nJhony is well aware that the roads in his area are badly damaged and have taken their toll on his vehicle. He must continuously have his car serviced and buy new tires to keep it in good condition and be able to work normally.

is Ligaya, sixty-one, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is a widow and a mother of four children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLigaya runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she sells used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Yolanda is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, also used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and were she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":902300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional inventory of clothes and processed meats.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T10:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T10:30:18Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6933,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7136.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275566,"comment":null},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":6934,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7137.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997970,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":6932.96,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7136.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606509,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5200.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5352.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095370,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T12:58:41Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:13:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393813,"name":"Saveng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saveng, fifty-three, is married, and resides with her husband and four children in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nGina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGina hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1008704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Manila City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T11:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T11:50:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2855.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275571,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2854.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997973,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2855.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606512,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2141.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095372,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T14:44:03Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:21:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393828,"name":"Jagdalmaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jagdalmaa is fifty-one years old and lives with her husband in Hovd province in Western Mongolia.

She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGina hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

is Nerissa, forty-two, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Emmanuel, a driver, and is the mother of three children. Together with her husband and children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNerissa oversees operations of their vehicle rental business. They have two L300 vans that they rent out to transport cargo or for people who need vehicles when transferring household goods to other places. They provide their services within the city and nearby provinces. Aside from this she also earns other income from making rugs. She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and do maintenance on her vans. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNerissa hopes to have her own house someday and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Rosalbina and her family live in their own house in Huaripampa, a neighborhood in the district of Palca in the province of Tarma.\r\n\r\nRosalbina is a woman who likes field work. Despite how hard and tiring her work can be, she likes producing and selling farm products. Her more than 20 years in agriculture have taught her the essentials about farming in an environment of unfavorable climate and seasons with low rainfall. For that reason she now grows potatoes, peas and gladioli, because these three products give her the most satisfaction. \"Gladioli are very profitable. They can be harvested twice a year and be planted any month,\" she says. Rosalbina does not care to transport the flowers to the city of Tarma, because they are in high demand there and the merchants are ready to travel to her village and negotiate a substantial price. Now she will plant gladioli and expects them to be ready in May, because May is one of the months with the highest flower prices.\r\n\r\nThis loan would be her thirteenth with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. She gives her word to be punctual with paying the installments. She is grateful and happy with her communal bank \"La Libertad de Huaripampa\" (the freedom of Huaripampa) because of the teamwork. She will use the loan to buy gladiolus seeds and a few bags of fertilizer to ensure growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1004546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He thinks that he does well with his business because he provides good service and he sells with charisma.\r\n\r\nFrank is grateful to the Kiva lenders, since with their support, he will be able to purchase more merchandise for his store.  This will allow him to have a greater variety of products in his hardware store and increase his income so that he can continue working towards his goal of expanding his store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1005565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Imperial","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T15:20:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frank John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":460.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":470.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":490.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":506.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":526.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":545.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.97},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":172.63,"local_amount":460.34,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":463.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993968,"comment":null},{"amount":176.36,"local_amount":470.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":473.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601868,"comment":null},{"amount":183.97,"local_amount":490.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":493.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090989,"comment":null},{"amount":189.93,"local_amount":506.48,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":509.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222062,"comment":null},{"amount":197.58,"local_amount":526.88,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":530.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298139,"comment":null},{"amount":204.53,"local_amount":545.42,"processed_date":"2012-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":548.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308109384,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T03:17:47Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393899,"name":"Beatriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatriz is 43 years old and lives in the Philippines.
