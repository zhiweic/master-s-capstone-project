Her husband has been running a small vegetable shop for many years in a nearby town and earning a reasonable income. \r\n\r\nTo grow his business, he is thinking of selling fruits in the evening so that he can increase his net income. With the passage of time, the inflation has been increasing day by day, but the sources of income remain constant. To increase his income, he wants to turn his enterprise towards progress, but for the purchase of fruits, he does not have a sufficient amount. He tried to borrow some money from his friends and relatives, but nobody helped him. Therefore, Shahnaz requested a loan for her husband so that her husband would be able to buy additional fruits to resell during the evening.

She lives in a common-law marriage with her partner. At one time her family suffered through a financially difficult period when she was unemployed and her partner\u2019s salary was not enough to cover household expenses.  So Adelaida decided to start her own business in order to generate income for her household and set up a general store about a year ago. Even though she had no experience, she was driven by her entrepreneurial spirit and used the trial and error method of running her store. In her store she offers paper goods, personal hygiene items, and cosmetics, and she also has three computers which she uses to provide an Internet caf\u00e9 service. She has thus been able to generate sufficient revenue to continue to meet her household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to invest in a variety of items at wholesale prices (notebooks, pencils, gift bags, cosmetics, and hygiene products, amongst others), and also to maintain her computers and expand the memory on them. This will allow her to provide better service to her customers because the computers will run faster and she will have more products available to meet their needs. This will result in an increase in her daily income allowing her to further organize and firmly establish her business.  She hopes that in the near future she can stabilize her finances and provide her children with better living conditions, a better education, and a better sense of well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":157.63,"image":{"id":1434364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy a variety of items at wholesale prices (notebooks, pencils, gift bags, cosmetics, and hygiene products, amongst others), and also to maintain her computers and expand the memory on them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":71376},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":73355},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75389},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77480},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":79628},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":81836},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84105},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86438},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88834},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":91298},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":93829},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96432}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.47},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.93},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.97,"local_amount":72318,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-20T09:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":72690.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410807500,"comment":null},{"amount":38.99,"local_amount":74261,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":74643.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420095594,"comment":null},{"amount":38.83,"local_amount":73958,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":74338.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430074645,"comment":null},{"amount":41.84,"local_amount":79691,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":80101.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440009843,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-22T12:44:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":606827,"name":"Tubeheza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Divine  fait partie du groupe  Tubeheza et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

She sells for both cash and credit to a customer base made up of mostly women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Fatoumata hopes to earn a monthly profit of 75,000 francs CFA, which she will use to pay back the loan and to help her husband provide for their family's expenses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":77.27,"image":{"id":1429592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to purchase second-hand clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19031.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624997,"comment":null},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":18181.82,"processed_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":19031.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851006,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T07:34:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":608042,"name":"Bunafsha","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d-\u0422\u044e\u0431\u0435 -

The members have a variety of business amongst which are: the sale of slippers, the sale of \"chu\u00f1o (dried potatoes), cell-phone sales, selling jewellery,  the sale of chickens, sewing blankets, and selling hardware. The loan will help all these micro-entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nM\u00e1xima says that she has been a member of Pro Mujer for fifteen years, joining on the invitation of her father who was also a member of the institution. Currently she has a business selling potatoes. She says she learned the business from her sister who sells the same product. She started selling with a capital of 100 BOB. This was amplified by the loans that she's received through pro Mujer.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that M\u00e1xima is currently requesting is to increase her capital (buying potatoes) which she buys at the traditional markets, wholesale, in the department of La Paz. She then sells them in her commercial space. This allows her to generate the resources needed to support her family. She is married and has five children. When asked what she liked about Pro Mujer her reply was that she liked the loans and the saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3996.17,"image":{"id":1434392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T03:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T03:10:01Z","loan_amount":5150,"lender_count":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesusa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemesia Faustina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":35480,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2920.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3374.9},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3420.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3467.3},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3514.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3562.22},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3610.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3659.94},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3709.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4239.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":423.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":489.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":496.47},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":503.29},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":510.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":517.06},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":524.14},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":538.49},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":615.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":423.95,"local_amount":2920.74,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T18:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410197953,"comment":null},{"amount":986.35,"local_amount":6795.3,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6815.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153729,"comment":null},{"amount":1013.43,"local_amount":6981.78,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7002.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615301,"comment":null},{"amount":1572.44,"local_amount":10833.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":10865.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T17:09:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607114,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marie.

Being very observant of life in his community, he realized that residents didn't have washing machines and that this service, which lessens the workload of housewives, did not exist in his neighborhood. So it happened that, in the absence of competition, he started to rent out washing machines in his own neighborhood. His neighborhood is located in the municipality of Soledad, 15 minutes away from the main city where he lives with his spouse and two children, aged 3 and 5. \r\n\r\nAlfredo's clients call him by telephone to request his rental washing machine service, and he brings the washing machines to each family's residence where he is paid by the hour. His job is intense and he works from Monday to Sunday from 7AM until 6PM. His main clients are his own neighbors, who send new clients to his rental washing machine service. His future goal is to extend his route towards other sectors that still don't have this service, but his response capacity is not sufficient enough to achieve this. This is the reason why he is turning to a Kiva loan: the first loan that he is taking out from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, he will buy new washing machines in order to gradually respond to the potential market demand because his greatest challenge is competition and the expense of repairing his older machines."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":120.95,"image":{"id":1434394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","use":"to buy new washing machines.

Aydee works in agriculture along with her husband on a 1-hectare plot of land, which she inherited from her parents-in-law and which is being held in wait for her young daughter. She has solid knowledge about agriculture, as she grew up in the fields next to her parents learning this humble job that also economically sustains many families in her region. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve her production quality, she fertilizes her cropland with organic fertilizer. It is very pleasing to her to participate in the harvest. After the corresponding drying of her products, she takes them to the sales center located in her community, where she receives excellent earnings in exchange, which allows her to justify the money that she invested in the productive season. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva, and she feels grateful for the financial support that she receives in order to get ahead. In addition, she is committed to paying off her quotas in a timely manner. This time, she is hoping for 1,000 nuevos soles to purchase wholesale organic fertilizer.

Approximately 35 years ago she learnt dressmaking and shortly afterwards she did a course in haute couture, in which she perfected her knowledge and technique. Thanks to the course, she saw an opportunity for a profitable business in this field, so she decided to start her own dressmaking workshop. It is located in her home, from which she offers service to third parties, does design work and mending and makes clothes to measure for her neighbours. She currently has a contract with a big business; she collaborates with three other people to produce packing bags for said business. Liliam is an active, enterprising, thriving, and persevering woman. She is requesting the loan in order to invest it in purchasing an industrial flat-bed sewing machine, with which she will be able to accelerate her production process. Then she will have the opportunity to have more contracts, thereby increasing her income and enabling her to continue looking after her family\u2019s welfare.

He has done farming work in the country, producing organic cacao and coffee, for five years. He says this is thanks to some parcels of land he bought together with some other farmers at a good price in an area on the outskirts of the city which has very fertile land. He does his work with the help of workers from the area, who give him all their support as far as group work is concerned, managing in this way to finish the daily work of maintenance and caring for the different fields in less time. However, the rainy season is a period in which maintenance work is affected by the mud and slippery paths. Finding himself in the middle of a productive season, he wishes to fertilize his cropland with organic compost and contract workers to carry out the second weeding of his fields. This is his third loan with Kiva and he feels grateful for the financial support he receives so he can get ahead. He is also committed to making his repayments on time.

Aziza has a university education and she works in a local school as a teacher. As the main source of income for her family, Aziza practices livestock breeding and crop farming. She started this business 10 years ago, with an initial purchase of cattle in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aziza's hard work, she currently has on her farm: 4 dairy cows and 2 horses, as well as a 1.16 hectare plot of land, on which she annually grows corn, clover and potatoes. Her monthly earnings are 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her farm, Aziza turned to Microcredit Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy cows to fatten them up for resale on the market for a good price. Aziza plans to invest the earnings from the loan in the further acquisition of livestock.

She will continue to work and strive to achieve her great dream of living in a better house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.82,"image":{"id":1432471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cooking supplies and ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T17:00:03Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135.38},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":143.55},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":151.15},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":155.01},{"due_date":"2014-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":161.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":171.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":173.98},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":181.72},{"due_date":"2014-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":187.81},{"due_date":"2014-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":195.61},{"due_date":"2014-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":202.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.19},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.88},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.91,"local_amount":275.62,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":277.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819739,"comment":null},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":143.77,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":144.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472660,"comment":null},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":151.15,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439695131,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-01T20:50:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607223,"name":"Ha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ha, 55, is married and has three children.

Not having attended school due to societal reasons, she soon started to work in small-scale commerce along side her mother, who used to sell fish. After several years of apprenticeship at her side, she is finally working by herself running several businesses: selling grains and sheep and making use of a grinder (mill). \r\n\r\nWith the goal of acquiring new, shiny equipment to cope with customer demands, she turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has had an association with the institution for the last 48 months. After two solidarity loans and two individual loans, which she repaid, she is now on her third individual loan, which she intends to use to purchase a grinder. She gets her supplies locally. \r\n\r\nMs. Fati accepts cash or credit from her customer base, composed mostly of women. She plans on making a monthly profit of 22,500 francs CFA that will be used to pay back the loan and to help her husband to cover family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1429634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a grinder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T17:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T17:20:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fati ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2014-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":36943.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625001,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":36943.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T21:30:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607240,"name":"Marchie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marchie manages her own farm of rice while, at the same time, works in a private company to earn a living.

She lives in a nuclear family in the Sokalakono district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali). She did not attend school because of her parents, conservative from years of colonization, who saw that educating girls was wasteful in life. So she started early on to work in small-scale commerce along side her mother, who used to sell fish. After several years of apprenticeship at her side, she finally opted to run a business buying and selling grains, especially rice.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her business capital to cope with customer demands, she turned toward the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has had an association with the institution for the last 24 months. After two individual loans, which she repaid, she is now on her third individual loan, which she will use to purchase 2 tonnes of rice. She gets her supplies locally and in Niono. \r\n\r\nMs. Fatoumata accepts cash or credit from her mixed customers base of city folks. She plans on making a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to pay back the loan and to support herself, as well as her grandchildren.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":208.33,"image":{"id":1429639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase sacks of rice to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-09-19T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-19T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata S\u00e9kou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429625002,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":51311.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439851011,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-19T20:41:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":607242,"name":"Ibrahim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibrahim is a 28-year-old married man, who has been working in the chicken business for the last ten years.

already experienced a lot in life. She divorced her husband and is now a single mother with two children. Aziza married young, so her children are already in school. Every mother knows how hard it is put a child through school; they need uniforms, bags, books, notebooks, and more. Aziza wants her children to have everything and tries her best to make them happy and prosperous. Aziza finished sewing courses and wants to take commissions to make traditional dresses at home.

","en":"Raqibjon is an experienced driver and a great family man. Raqibjon has two children, a boy and a girl. Raqibjon wakes up every morning and thanks God for this life. He has everything that is important to him: a beautiful wife, healthy children and a good job. Raqibjon has a Volga car and uses it not only as a means of transportation, but also as a means to make a living. He drives people from his village to the city of Tutk Istaravshan and back again. In a day, he can earn up to 16 somoni. It's not much, but he likes to drive and taxi people from one point to another. Raqibjon is taking out a loan because his 1980 Volga broke down and he urgently needs to repair it. With the loan, Raqibjon will repair the car and get back to work. In the future, he hopes to buy a new car. We hope that, with your help, Raqibjon will have good fortune.

","en":"Every child boasts that his mom is the kindest, most gentle, and most talented mother around. Perhaps more than any other children, Salomat's children brag about their mother since she is a true master of her craft. Salomat is not only an outstanding cook, she also sews traditional dresses with embroidery. She embroiders with beads, colored stones, and gold thread, not only on dresses, but also on tablecloths. Sitting at a table with such a tablecloth is always pleasant. This kind of intense work takes a long time, and you don't notice how time flies.

He lives in the rural area near Lahore, Pakistan. He is the father of five children and equally responsible for all of them. He is a milkman by profession, and he sells milk in the nearby town. He sells pure and fresh milk; this is the reason he is very famous in his town. Jahngir is poor, so he does not have enough buffaloes to get milk and does not have sufficient funds to buy more buffaloes. He does not even have enough money to maintain the cowshed.\r\n\r\nHe decided to buy heifers, because a heifer is cheaper than a buffalo and they grow up in a short time. He will feed them in a better way, and he will devote himself fully to the care of the heifers. He hopes they will grow up soon, so he could get milk from them. Therefore, he requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that he could buy heifers in bulk, could grow them up, and could get milk in large quantity. With the profit amount, he will maintain the cowshed and pay back all the installments due on the loan. \r\n\r\nThis time Jahngir is very hopeful, that he will earn maximum income and he will successfully change the lives of his family.

He used the previous loan to buy the missing fruits and vegetables and has paid back the entire previous loan successfully. He managed to use his business profit to pay school fees and household expenses. LUCAS will use this loan to restock the out of stock fruits and vegetables. Lucas is doing fine with his genge (grocery hut).

She started this business, because she wants to strive for herself and her family's welfare.\r\n\r\nShe's been in this business since 2006, and she sells things like soda, milk, cigarettes and bread, to her community.  She says that the main problem for her business is her customers' low purchasing power during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nKadiatu requested this loan through BRAC Sierra Leone. She will use it to buy more products to sell, like soda, milk, cigarettes and biscuits.  She says that the extra income from this loan will help her increase her business and improve her standard of living.  In the future, she would like to buy a plot of land.

Nowadays, her kids rely on her as they are still in school. To cover the daily basic needs of her family, she works at a factory as her main source of income. To supplement the family's income, she and her husband grow rice and raise chickens. With this current business, she can earn about 37,800 KHR per day. \r\n\r\nKimly has been with Kiva's partner, VisionFund, for two cycles including this loan.

She has four children who are all in various grades of primary school. She is married and works by farming potatoes to sell and earn income for her family. She also grows corn and beans to sell sometimes. Her main objective is to farm for consumption due to the high prices of these items on the market. For many years, she has farmed potatoes because her parents taught her how to work the land from an early age. This is her family's primary commercial activity. She completed one grade of primary education, which is thanks to her parents' help. Her biggest challenge is getting a great harvest to sell every season. There are factors such as rain, plagues, and other events that can damage her crop and make her lose the whole harvest.\r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to earn a good income at the end of the harvest so she can reinvest part of her earnings into her crops. She also wants to invest in her home because it needs improvements including the floor, crack repair, and a safer roof. This will improve her quality of life and give her children a better environment. This is why she is currently requesting a loan from COMIXMUL.

At 11 years old he began working at his father's side on the farms, planting and harvesting. When he turned 22 years old he began to work his own land at the side of his wife Mar\u00eda Juana. Delfino grows banana leaf on his farm which provides shade to his plants and in addition the leaves are in demand in the market as they are used in preparing food, and this generates extra income.

Today, she is proud to be famous in her community and the best at making beautiful patterns with threads and beads. She has attained a regular list of customers. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue her operations, she has requested a loan of PKR 25,000 to buy reels of threads in different colors, along with packs of beads, sequins and stones for its embellishment.

She is a very punctual and responsible client. In these three years she hasn't had a single late payment. She continues to develop her business fattening cattle. Mahbuba is the last child in the family and her parents don't want to let her go to Russia; they want her to stay here and continue her business. Of course, her parents help with the business. Her father does the buying and selling of the cattle. At the moment Mahbuba is in financial need and therefore has turned to Arvand for a loan. She plans to increase her number of cattle and further develop her business, which is the primary source of income for her family.

Uuljan has secondary education. As a main income for her family, Uuljan works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started 19 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Uuljan's persistent work, her farm currently has one dairy cow, one calf and 40 sheep. She also has a plot of land of 2.0 hectares where she grows beans every year.

Nurizat has a university education. As the main source of income for her family, Nuriza practices crop farming. She started this business 8 years ago, with a start-up investment of 30,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nuriza's hard work, on her farm she currently has a 1.5 hectare plot of land, on which she grows peppers, tomatoes and beans. Every year, she receives a rich and bountiful harvest. She then sells her produce in bulk at the local vegetable market. Her monthly earnings are 15,000 som (KGS). For the further development of her farming business, Nurizat turned to Microfinance Bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners.\" She is requesting a loan in the amount of 65,000 som (KGS) to use for harvesting.
