","en":"Juana is very happy with the support from the COMIXMUL cooperative in alliance with the KIVA investors. Thanks to the first loan she asked for she was able to meet her goal of fortifying the soil and the crops by buying fertilizer, among other things. These helped her to be a part of a big development and be able to obtain an excellent corn and bean harvest. She hasn't been able to sell them because the market price is low. Today she is asking for a second loan to plant the back field so she can obtain a better harvest and wait for the market price to go up. This way, she will have a little more time and be able to wait for the market to rise and sell a part of the grains that have already been harvested and keep the other part to improve her earnings and invest in next year's crop. She hopes that she will be supported again so she can get ahead and at some time, have her own capital.

She will use it to buy jeans and blouses for her clients to wear in the coming festive season. It is a busy time for business which Gisela wants to take full advantage of.

from the Kandal Stoeng district of Kandal province, Sorphea is a mother of three kids who are in school. She is 40 years old and strives to make a living by rice farming. To supplement the family's income, her husband drives a tricycle-motorbike for a fee. She wants to keep her kids in school, but educational costs are quite a challenge for her. To overcome this challenge, she is applying for a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). This is not the first loan for Sorphea with VisionFund. After the previous loan, which she has repaid successfully, she feels confident that she can improve her lifestyle soon. She will spend her entire loan to pay for tuition for her son, who is pursuing a bachelor's degree in Finance and Banking. She hopes that she can support her son until graduation so that he can get a good

old and she is a widow.  After the death of her husband, she raised four children and ran the household by herself.  Shaken has a high school education and as the main source of income for her family she raises livestock, which she started doing 25 years ago with the purchase of animals for 1,000 som KGS.

The family works really hard to be able to earn a living. The family is also engaged in plant cultivation; they have a greenhouse, where they cultivate tomato, cucumber, and pepper. Srbuhi is also engaged in cultivation of watermelon. She currently needs to make some investments in her agribusiness in order for it to function in a sustainable way.\r\n\r\nA loan of USD 2,500 will be a big support to this hard-working woman and her family, enabling them to purchase bottles and cellophane for the greenhouse, buy cucumber seeds and some fertilizers, and renovate the greenhouse. \r\n\r\nShe has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to return it back.

The women have an average age of 40 years, are married, and have at least 5 children each. The women of this group are in business selling various items, such as rice, peanuts, beans, baskets, etc. In order to expand their businesses, the members decided to partner with the loan program of Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their first group loan.\r\n\r\nMife is a member of the Wassa group, pictured seated in the middle of the photo. She plans to use her loan to purchase bags of beans and baskets for resale.

He is married and has two children.  He lives with his father in his father's home.  He has helped his father with animal-husbandry and agriculture since he was young, and has a lot of experience.  His wife is a very hard-working woman and Egamberdi and his wife are engaged in the business of animal husbandry.  He purchases young calves, fattens them, and then sells milk and meat from the full-grown cattle.  Egamberdi makes good money in this business. He also grows and sells potatoes, and, though this is a seasonal business, it also brings in good money.  In 2012 Egamberdi partnered with Arvand and his wife says that since then their lives have changed for the better.  With the profit from their business, they were able to put together a wedding for their son.  Egamberdi has again turned to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to purchase several head of cattle to expand his business.  He thanks Arvand in advance for its financial

She is trying her best to improve her quality of life and bolster her family's finances.  She is married and currently raising 4 children.  Her husband is a simple worker and does not make much money; his salary is not enough to provide the family with all the necessities of life.  For the sake of her family, Sarbiniso has decided to set up a new business; she wants to start her own farm, growing crops such as wheat, potatoes, and tomatoes among others.  With this goal in mind, she has taken a course organized by an association for businesswomen titled \"Attain Success\", and received a certificate upon completing the course.  She hopes to use the profits from her prospective farm to provide her children with a good education as well as to make sure her children have plenty of filling, nourishing food to eat.  She is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to buy seeds and mineral fertilizers, as well as to rent a plot of land for her new business.  She is counting on your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":92.97,"image":{"id":1453395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for rent land and to buy seeds and fertilizer for setting up a new farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T08:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T08:10:20Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarbiniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.46},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":217.65},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.02},{"due_date":"2014-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":228.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":243.27},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":251.65},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":259.01},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.46},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.5},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":290.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.52},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":211.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":218.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228630,"comment":null},{"amount":47.15,"local_amount":217.65,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":224.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989578,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T15:45:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619711,"name":"Arceli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arceli is 39 years old and lives in Mialen, Clarin, Philippines.

She is 30 years old. She was born in the city of Isfara. She is married and has three children. Her husband is a construction specialist and works on a by-order basis. As Khursheda does not have an education, she practices fattening up and reselling cattle. Her husband helps her, of course. Fattening up cattle brings good earnings to the family, which is why they are trying to develop this business. They have three children and Khursheda dreams that her children will study in good schools and will receive a higher education in the future. In order to achieve this, the parents do their best to work extremely hard. Currently, Khursheda is planning to buy several cattle to increase her herd. \r\n\r\nUnder the advice of acquaintances, she decided to fill out an application for a loan and turned to the Arvand microcredit organization.

Ismoilkhon had been taking out loans from local banks for about 10 years. But he discovered that through MLO Humo and Partners one can take out a loan at a low rate and over a short term. For that reason he turned to Humo to get a advantageous loan, in order to start his own new livestock-breeding business. Ismoilkhon plans to buy and sell cattle. He has personal equity in the form of a two floor cowshed and food for the livestock. With the money from the loan, Ismoilkhon wants to purchase 6 cows and calves. He has a business plan about how best to fatten and sell the livestock and he plans to stick to the plan while planning his business.

In this group, the most common job is in sales, but there are a variety of positions, like cheese sales, clothing sales, creating and selling weaving, craft sales, and also a pastry shop and a paintball business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells crafts. About 14 years ago, she began purchasing wooden crafts made by prison inmates. She has lacked money at times, but has always been able to move forward.\r\n\r\nWith the loan that she is requesting, she will be able to purchase even more crafts now that she has has some orders. Due to the recent orders, she is confident that things will go well for her, but she needs the money to invest.\r\n\r\nThe thing that she enjoys the most about working with Fondo Esperanza is that there is always an enjoyable dynamic within the group."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3535.53,"image":{"id":1454689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy crafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Villarrica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-10-21T15:10:44Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-20T15:10:44Z","loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ignacio Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Edder Josue","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Teresa Carlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marlene Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Alicia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Flor Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eliana Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Veronica Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Erika De Las Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Gertrudis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marilyn Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":2087997,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133598},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143659},{"due_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":144748},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":140431},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":151868},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":148060},{"due_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":149188},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":150317},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":151455},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":152608},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":153765},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":154933},{"due_date":"2014-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":156101},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":157266}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.93},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.63},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.12},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":301.36},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":303.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":305.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.62},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.98},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":317.73},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1075.35,"local_amount":528310,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":530843.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419854941,"comment":null},{"amount":1215.22,"local_amount":597030,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":599892.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503272,"comment":null},{"amount":1244.96,"local_amount":611640,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":614572.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728233,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T01:08:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619811,"name":"Rasul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasul is 31 years old and lives in the town of Koboko in the Arua region of Uganda.

To help expand his business, Rasul has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 UGX (Ugandan Shillings) from BRAC Uganda.
