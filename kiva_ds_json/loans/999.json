She works as an accountant at a publishing house in the city of Novaya Kahovka. Yana got married not long ago, and she and her husband moved to their own apartment. The apartment has been in need of repair for a long time, but the young family has not had the necessary funds to repair it. \r\n\r\nYana turned to Kiva for a loan in the amount of 8,000 hryvnia for personal purposes. She did not have enough money of her own to change three windows and windowsills in the apartment, and further to set up a balcony. After the cold came, and the apartment became significantly colder, this need became more pressing for the whole of Yana's family. Therefore she decided to stop postponing the repair and make use of Kiva's financial services, and thereby making the family's life easier and create comfort in the house.

Desde muy peque\u00f1o el c\u00f3nyuge de Melvis trabaj\u00f3 en el mar con su padre y cuando Melvis y \u00e9l, formaron su propia familia, ella aprendi\u00f3 a elaborar esta herramienta de pesca, la que posteriormente se convirtiera en su negocio, por eso hoy  se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y reparaci\u00f3n de trasmallos, atarrayas y tambi\u00e9n genera ingresos mediante el comercio de ropa en esta misma poblaci\u00f3n de clientes. En el medio de los pescadores, antiguos compa\u00f1eros de los esposos de Melvis, ella es muy reconocida y es all\u00ed donde se encuentra en sus principales y fieles clientes, que le llevan atarrayas y trasmallos, para que esta los repare y quedaran listos  una semana despu\u00e9s. Melvis diariamente se acomoda en su acostumbrada silla,  empieza a entretejer entre hilos de nylon, utilizando agujas elaboradas en PVC, que algunas veces compra, mientras otras su esposo  las elabora para ella. En este mismo mercado ha conocido muchas personas y tambi\u00e9n les vende ropa exterior e interior y esta vez quiere contar con mucha existencia de mercanc\u00eda, porque se acerca la navidad y el a\u00f1o nuevo y las familias ya han encargado la ropa que lucir\u00e1n en estas fiestas llenas de alegr\u00eda y muy familiares. As\u00ed Melvis se ha acercado a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para solicitar un credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materia primas e insumos para  tejer y tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1  la ropa que vestir\u00e1n sus clientes en las fiestas mas lindas del a\u00f1o.  ","en":"Melvis, 28, is the mother of two children, ages 9 and 12.  She and her husband have a goal of getting them ahead and seeing them become professionals so they have the potential for success in the future.\r\n\r\nMelvis's husband worked in the ocean with his father from a very young age.  When he and Melvis started their own family, she learned to make this fishing tool, which later she would turn into a business.   That's why today she works making and repairing trammel nets and fishnets.  She also generates income with a clothing business in this same community of customers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the fishermen, old friends of Melvis's husband, she's very well known, and that's where she finds her main and most loyal customers.  They bring her fishnets and trammel nets, which she'll repair and have ready for them a week later.\r\n\r\nEvery day Melvis gets comfortable in her customary chair and begins to weave with nylon thread, using needles made of PVC that sometimes she buys, sometimes her husband makes for her.  In this same market she has met a lot of people, and she also sells them clothing and underwear.  This time she wants to have a lot of merchandise because Christmas and New Year are coming and families have already ordered the clothes they'll look good in for these holidays that are full of happiness and family.\r\n\r\nSo Melvis approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request a Kiva loan with which she'll buy raw materials and supplies to weave.  She'll also buy the clothing that her customers will wear during the most beautiful celebrations of the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1240589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials

Together they have one daughter, Magaly, who is 17. They live in their own home located in a rural annex of the central forest. Gladys is of fragile appearance but is very hard-working. Her zone is favorable for producing good quality coffee beans. Her fertile lands are appropriate and good for producing coffee with a good aroma. It is for that reason that every weekend she and her husband care for their coffee plantings. They have already been working at this for 16 years, and as mentioned their coffee is very well known in the Alto Palomar cooperative, where they sell their harvest each agricultural season. She comments that they always have a tree nursery, from which they renovate their older plantings. Now they have 3000 little plants in the process of germinating; with them they hope to have new and better coffee beans. Their nearest goals are to tend their plantings, since next year she hopes to have a good harvest, because she has confidence in their effort. For this, she needs support to acquire what is necessary so that this will be possible. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Prestatarios de la Uni\u00f3n Palomar\" (Borrowers of Palomar Union), and this is her second loan with MFP, where she hopes to advance with the support of her communal bank, those who will work hard to advance.\r\n\r\nWith the money Gladys will be able to pay the day laborers to clean her plantings.

is 23 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child who is currently in school. For the past 3 years, Laumes has been working hard to manage her small market stall, in which she sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains, or a meal made when they are steamed).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Laumes has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more sweet potatoes for resale, and will help Laumes generate greater profits and pay for some of the school facilities for her child, like exercise books. Laumes hopes that in the future she will be able to own her residential house. \r\n\r\nLaumes is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1240332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to

She sells \"anticuchos\" (skewered, grilled meat, usually beef hearts) from a stand that is located in a commercial center.

is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fortportal region of Uganda. For the past six years, Janiffer has been working hard to manage her small market stall where she sells fresh food such as matooke.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Janiffer has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava to sell. This will help Janiffer to generate greater profits, allowing her to pay school fees for her young sister. Janiffer hopes that she will be able to buy a vehicle in the future.\r\n\r\nJaniffer is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.

Fansta is 21 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, of whom two are currently in school. For the past 3 years, Fansta has been working hard to manage her small market stall, in which she sells fresh food like matooke (green plantains, or a meal made when they are steamed).\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Fansta has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava for resale. This will help Fansta to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children and to pay for medical bills. Fansta hopes that in the future she will be able to educate her children up to university level and also to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nFansta is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The loan will be used to buy more fresh food like matooke, sweet potatoes, and cassava for resale, and will help Penina to generate greater profits and pay for medical bills.

is a resident of the Kongowea area of Coast Province, Kenya. He is married and owns a charcoal business that has been in operation for four years. He is also a sales agent who is paid on commission. \r\n\r\nMwendwa learned about Milango Financial Services from a friend. He joined the organization with the goal of accessing credit to improve his business operations. His main challenges are the punitive measures enforced on charcoal sellers by the local authorities, and the lack of capital for expansion.

For the past 2 years, Jane has been working hard to manage her small retail shop, which sells plastic materials that are used for plates.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more plastic items such as cups and plates that will be sold in the shop.  This will help Jane to generate greater profits and to pay for her medical bills.  Jane hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and to build a house. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides a safe place for young Ugandan women to participate in group activities, and provides a forum for life skills

Hawa was born in Makeni City 35 years ago.

She lives in a simple structure with her four children and their father. She is a hard-working and dedicated woman who works to help her family by bringing in extra income. \r\n\r\nCelia is excited to be taking her seventh loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for about nine years, starting off with her own savings after working in different jobs. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by all different styles of shoes, for women, men and kids.

and who are her principal reason for living. She is friendly, hardworking and enthusiastic. Together with her husband they work hard to get their family ahead. Unfortunately, due to the need to work from a very young age to support her parents, Catalina was not able to study a career, but she would have liked to have done so. In her free time she likes to cook a delicious meal of Pallares con Seco [Lima beans with dried meat] to share with her family.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of hard work and enthusiasm, some years ago Catalina began farming.

They have a beautiful daughter named Angelis who is three years old.  They live in a house they own located in a rural area. Chriss is a young woman of deep convictions.  She works in agriculture.  It's hard work to do seeding, fertilizing and harvest, a commitment Chriss took on 10 years ago; according to her she liked the land and rural life since she was little, she now has more than two hectares of land where she plants bananas and harvests twice a month.  What she likes the most is to be able to negotiate her delicious bananas through third parties; who gladly advise her about new markets where she can expand to and offer her fruit.  This is why later on she wants to be recognized as a good farmer. A year ago she also got a plot of land with coffee, she takes good care of it to harvest and sell.

Cuenta que hace 9 a\u00f1os se dedica a la agricultura; donde sus principales sembr\u00edos constan de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos, y palta. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a ella, es poder sacar el quillo (tipo de maleza que crece entre los cultivos) que crece constantemente, pues as\u00ed asegura que sus cultivos crecer\u00e1n sin mayores inconvenientes. El trabajo esforzado que diariamente proporciona a sus cultivos principalmente de pl\u00e1tanos, hace que 2 veces al mes viaje a las ciudades de La Merced y Villa Rica, donde vende sus frutos. Pero como sabe que las \u00e9pocas de cosecha de caf\u00e9 son una vez al a\u00f1o, ella desea mejorar e incrementar la siembra de diferentes frutas, as\u00ed est\u00e1 segura que no tendr\u00e1 inconvenientes en su econom\u00eda. Por ahora se prepara para la raspa de caf\u00e9 (recolecci\u00f3n de los \u00faltimos granos maduros), donde espera obtener buenas ganancias. Ahora tiene pensado pagar a jornaleros que contratar\u00e1 para que atiendan sus cultivos.\nElla pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLa uni\u00f3n hace la fuerza del palomar\u201d y este es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera de la colaboraci\u00f3n de todos ustedes para continuar con sus objetivos. \nCarmen destinar\u00e1 el dinero en el pago de los jornaleros que contratar\u00e1 para la limpieza de sus cultivos, con lo sobrante comprar\u00e1 bolsas de fertilizantes.   \n\n","en":"Carmen, 48, is married to Herminio and they have four children.  Their 15-year-old daughter, Merly, is the only one who still lives at home.  They own the home they live in which is next to the central forest.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very dynamic and active in her work.  For nine years she has been farming crops, with the main ones being coffee, bananas and avocado.  What she enjoys most is removing the weeds that grow constantly, because that ensures her crops can grow better.  The daily hard work she puts into growing bananas means she must travel twice a month to the cities of La Merced and Villa Rica where she sells her produce.  But since she knows the coffee harvest season is only once a year she wants to improve and expand into growing different crops so she does not run into economic problems.  Now she is preparing to harvest the last coffee beans that she hopes will give her a good profit.  She plans to hire workers to take care of the crops.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"La uni\u00f3n hace la fuerza del palomar\" and this is her third loan through MFP.  She hopes to count on your help to meet her goals.\r\n\r\nCarmen will use the money to hire workers to clear her cropland and to buy bags of fertilizer.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1240758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":258.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":288.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":299.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":295.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":321.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333.88},{"due_date":"2013-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":346.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":355.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.68},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.87},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.11},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.53},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.07},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":120.77,"local_amount":309.66,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":315.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053877,"comment":null},{"amount":92.88,"local_amount":238.15,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":242.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188903,"comment":null},{"amount":116.87,"local_amount":299.68,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":305.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572799,"comment":null},{"amount":115.11,"local_amount":295.15,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":300.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122463,"comment":null},{"amount":125.53,"local_amount":321.87,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":327.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868283,"comment":null},{"amount":130.21,"local_amount":333.88,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":339.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577103,"comment":null},{"amount":135.07,"local_amount":346.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":352.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529385,"comment":null},{"amount":138.56,"local_amount":355.28,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":361.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974507,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-24T05:57:07Z","paid_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":498963,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia tiene 50 a\u00f1os, convive con Jaime.

The family, grandparents and grandchildren all live together in their own house.\r\n\r\nBernardina rents public transportation vehicles for a living.  She owns four motor-taxis that she rents to different drivers who come to the house to hire their working vehicle.  The income she earns from this allows her to cover basic household expenses.  Sometimes it is her own children or brothers who drive the vehicles and other times it is neighborhood youth who she knows very well.  All of her vehicles are kept in good condition, but the circulation permit on some of them is about to expire.  \r\n\r\nShe has been in business for 20 years and started out from scratch with a lot of optimism and determination.  What she likes most about her work is that it allows her to spend time with the family and take care of other household activities.  She also generates extra income for the daily running of the household.  Business has been going well until now, so she hopes to continue in this vein and expand her fleet.\r\n\r\nThis is her 11th loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support she receives there, which helps her to continue increasing her work capital.  She plans to use the 1,000 PEN loan to buy insurance for two of her motor-taxis and spare parts for one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1240768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy insurance for two of her moto-taxis and spare parts for one of them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":159},{"due_date":"2013-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":158.4},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":181.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.36},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.89},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":153.29,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053879,"comment":null},{"amount":126.96,"local_amount":317.4,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":331.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572801,"comment":null},{"amount":68.33,"local_amount":170.84,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":178.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122465,"comment":null},{"amount":70.89,"local_amount":177.21,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":185,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868285,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":181.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":189.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577105,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-21T16:01:53Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":498966,"name":"San Miguel Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 San Miguel es de la ciudad de Lambar\u00e9, est\u00e1 integrado por 15 mujeres muy trabajadoras, que se esmeran por ir creciendo y ayudando a su familia.\nPatricia, la presidenta es una persona muy emprendedora y luchadora, trabaja todos los d\u00edas en su puesto y es gracias a su trabajo que ella est\u00e1 saliendo adelante y puede ayudar a su familia.

is a rural villager from Takeo Province's Samrong District where silk weaving is a popular business in the neighborhood.

Sokha is a silk weaver and a grocery seller in the local area while her husband is a rice farmer on one hectare of farmland to tackle the family's difficulties. \r\n\r\nHaving been engaged in this business for 25 years, Sokha is able to save up to five US dollars per day from her current business after deducting the expenses. This is Sokha's second-cycle loan with Kiva's partner, VisionFund. The previous business loan, which she successfully repaid, helped her to sustain her living conditions as well as gradually helping her business. \r\n\r\nIn this loan cycle, she is applying for an education loan of 1,600 US dollars to cover the entire tuition fees for four years for her oldest son, an 18-year-old freshman specializing in finance and banking at a local university. Sokha very much hopes that this loan will enable her to send her oldest son to university. That will also help her son to obtain a higher education background so that he can get a good job after graduation in order to support the family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":79,"image":{"id":1240838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

She is married to Rolando, a laborer at a construction site, and is a mother to her children. She, together with her husband, manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMary Grace operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two people when buying cooked rice and food costs less than raw food. Mary Grace also has a direct selling business to earn additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operating her business, she is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan. Mary Grace will be utilizing the loan to buy more raw ingredients like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMary Grace hopes that her business will expand soon and dreams of providing her children with a good and quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

She started out selling bread rolls, crisps and snacks outside the city's public transport terminals with her cousin. The bus conductors then asked her to sell pies as well, and these subsequently became her main product. \r\n\r\nCarmi\u00f1a's husband helps her to buy supplies while she is in charge of preparing the food and selling it. Everyday she chops vegetables, seasons the meat, and boils the water, adding a little salt. She then mixes the vegetable and meat together with rice or flour and wraps it in bijao tree leaves and ties each bundle with twine. It is cooked for several hours, after which it is unwrapped and fried. \r\n\r\nCarmi\u00f1a's pies are very well-cooked which is why her clients return time and again to buy them, especially for parties and at weekends. She also sells snacks, juices and drinks for cash or credit to restaurants and in the community where she lives. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is applying for her first kiva loan with which she will buy wholesale staple goods such as rice, meat products, crisps and snacks, drinks and other supplies in order to meet demand for the end of the year.

She comments that she works in squares during the afternoon and sometimes her husband and her son help her.  During the summer her clientele increases and she doesn\u2019t have enough cars to rent so the children can have fun.  She rents them for ten minutes at a time at prices that are adequate for her clientele.\r\n\r\nMerchandise she needs she buys in the city of Santiago from suppliers and low-cost vendors which is advantageous economically.  She will use the loan to buy a little pedal car for the children\u2019s amusement.  One of Nubia\u2019s goals is to acquire more little cars to lease in order to have a better quality of life and provide wellbeing for her family.\r\n\r\nNubia lives with her husband and two children who are 15 and 7 years of age and are attending school.

In the Philippines balut is well-known egg that is sold in the sidewalk. It is a duck egg that has not been hatched. Instead, it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes their energy and strength. Se and her husband boil and sell about 450-600 balut eggs every night. They do the selling themselves to avoid the commissions of vendors who would sell it. They earn 300 PHP in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nLiezel is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP that she will use to  buy balut and quail eggs. She also has a variety store, and she will use part of the loan to buy groceries and toiletries. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLiezel dreams of expanding her business and hopes to have a good life.

These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Andro will expand his Georgian bakery and increase the amount of baked bread. This will increase sales volume.

is a 27-year-old single young man. For the past two years, Ahmad has had a mobile phone store. He has a good reputation between customers, so he has many loyal clients who request and buy modern mobiles. This makes Ahmad's project a profitable one and the only source of income to him, but also it needs more support from time to time to cover the cost of bringing in a modern collection of mobiles.\r\n\r\nAhmad is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a collection of mobile phones. This will attract more customers and increase Ahmad's income and insure him a better future.\r\n\r\nAhmad is photographed inside his store.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is from the small town of Zestaponi. She is 44 years old, divorced and lives with her 24-year-old son. Nino gets her income from a newly started business in her local town. She is involved in a trading business. Nino buys clothes and household items from wholesalers and sells them among her neighbors. The income from this business is hardly enough to cover just food and everyday expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nNino requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for developing a family business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers.\r\n\r\nBecause the income is not enough for the family, Nino decided to expand the existing business with the requested loan. Her loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nNino will purchase stock of clothes in Tbilisi (the capital city) for wholesale prices and resell them in her town for a profit. It will be hard work for Nino, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family. The increased profit will be reinvested in the trading business to increase her stock and sales volume. The family members will be able to increase their spending to satisfy their daily needs in order to improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1241078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

de 34 a\u00f1os, aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar con alimentos de su t\u00eda, porque siempre le ha gustado las labores de cocina; as\u00ed fue que cuando decidi\u00f3 generar ingresos a trav\u00e9s de un negocio de venta de comidas, su c\u00f3nyuge fue el primero en apoyarla  con el capital inicial y as\u00ed ella ha logrado hacer crecer su negocio y   generar ingresos, con los cuales apoya su hogar

Por esta raz\u00f3n ella, est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  porque quiere aprovechar que se acercan las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o, para invertir en materias primas y aumentar el volumen de sus ventas, porque es en esta \u00e9poca  en la cual logra un mayor movimiento de compradores superior a los que usualmente  llegan a su negocio. Y esto es justamente la raz\u00f3n de que su credikiva sea exitoso. ","en":"Alejandra, 34, learned to work with food from her aunt because she has always enjoyed kitchen work. When she decided to earn income through a business selling food, her partner was the first one to support her with the initial capital. In this way she has succeeded in growing her business and in earning income, with which she supports her household consisting of her husband, a bricklayer, and their two children, aged 3 and 10 years. In her business, she sells fried meat products such as pig, chorizo, rennet, entrails, etc. at a shop located in her house. She waits on customers from 8 in the morning until 9 at night. This is how customers eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at Alejandra's business. The location of this business improves its sales, since it is located near a soccer field where many sportspeople meet, especially on weekends and holidays. Alejandra's main goal is to expand, but her challenge is not having sufficient capital and work to achieve that as soon as she dreams of doing. Because of this, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She wants to take advantage of the fact that the end of year holidays are approaching to invest in raw materials and increase her sales volume, because it is at this time of year that she has more customers than usually come to her business. And this is precisely the reason that her Kiva loan will be a success."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1241548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy raw materials such as beef, pork, and entrails","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-11-21T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-12-21T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89944},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92042},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94190},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96388},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98637},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100938},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":103294},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105704},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108170},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110693}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.42},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.39},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.72,"local_amount":89944,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":93943.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130866,"comment":null},{"amount":52.92,"local_amount":92042,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":96134.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519733,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":94190,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":98378.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356497790,"comment":null},{"amount":55.42,"local_amount":96388,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100674.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527596,"comment":null},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":98637,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":103023.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928357,"comment":null},{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":92883,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-27T09:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":97013.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420083164,"comment":null},{"amount":250.65,"local_amount":435916,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":455300.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439732292,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-11-27T19:45:19Z","paid_date":"2014-01-25T09:52:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":499203,"name":"Sophio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sopio is a 30-year-old woman from a small village in the Khashuri district.

who is pictured inside his barbershop, is a 21-year-old single young man.

Mohammad's shop is located in the central market of the city where there is good movement of customers. Mohammad has many loyal clients, which makes his business a profitable one, but it needs more support to cover some necessary costs.\r\n\r\nMohammad is requesting a loan from FATEN to cover the cost of purchasing a chair and shaving machine for his barbershop. Taking this loan will improve Mohammad's work in the barbershop, which will satisfy his clients and increase their demand.  This will increase Mohammad's income and insure him a bright future.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is 27 years old. He earns his income through the sale of crops and livestock at a small shop that he owns. He grows maize, beans, coffee, cassava, passion fruit, potatoes, groundnuts, bananas, sweet potatoes, cabbage, eggplant, avocados and mangos. He also has cows, goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens. \r\n\r\nJoseph looks forward to becoming a Community Knowledge Worker (CKW). As a CKW he will use the materials in his business-in-a-box (smartphone, solar charging set and weighing scale) to disseminate vital agricultural information to the other members of his village.  The information Joseph provides will help them to improve their crop yields and to increase their incomes.  \r\n\r\nWith the additional money that he will earn as a CKW, Joseph will invest in his farming business, increasing the offerings of his store. He dreams of being an exemplary farmer for the rest of his community, so that everyone knows that they can come to him to find out things that they do not yet know about agricultural businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":103.74,"image":{"id":1241155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She lives south of the city with her husband and her daughter, 20 years old, whom she dreams of seeing become a successful professional. Her business idea was inspired by her parents when she was very young, and when she decided to develop her own entrepreneurial adventure, a friend supported her. Together they started to make items for their closest friends and family members. Maria does all of the production work in her business, from the design through the cutting, preparation, assembly, and finishing of pieces. With the quality of Maria's work and her capacity for learning about various product lines, she has succeeded in building up a market among residents of the area and some clinics, where her customers have referred her. Currently, she is selling mainly on credit, and with the degree to which her market is growing, the working capital is insufficient to respond to orders. This is why she is taking out a Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy supplies to make bed linens, curtains, and home linens. Her greatest potential for success with this investment is her 7 years of experience, during which she has built up a clientele and learned when to invest, as she will do now with her Kiva loan at the end of the year. It is a time of holidays, when families make many changes to their homes in order to meet Christmas and the new year very up-to-date and with many dreams and

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

39-year-old Maseray from Kulanda town in the Southern area of Bo.

In 1999, Maseray established a business selling plastic slippers. She began her business in order to generate income to educate her children. She works at the business six days per week.  Her major business challenge is the cost of transportation from the place where she purchases her goods to her town in Bo. \r\n\r\nMaseray requires a loan in order to buy more plastic slippers. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to send one of her children to university and start a savings account. In the future, Maseray plans to open a big slipper store.
