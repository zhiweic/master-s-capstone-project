As a main source of income for her family, she works with livestock breeding, after having started 20 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Mubarak's persistent work, her farm currently has three dairy cows and 10 sheep. Her husband works with transport of cargo and does not have a large income either. The total monthly income is 10,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Mubarak turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase sheep for increasing the number of livestock.

Hellen will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser, and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Hellen wants to be a promoter because her people chose her and she is willing to serve the community. Hellen believes that the dispenser will prevent diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Hellen\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1467128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T22:10:08Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aggrey ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T21:00:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":630405,"name":"Zuhura's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Jong'Ondi village in Vihiga, Kenya, Zuhura has volunteered to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser.

Bermet became a widow very early and was left without a provider and a husband, and her children - without a father. It was hard to stop grieving the loss of her closest friend, but Bermet took a hold of herself and made plans. How would she feed her family now? How will she raise her children? How will she provide all six children with an education? After discussing all of this with her children, the family decided to send the eldest son to the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Bermet gave her meager savings to her son and he was able to use that money to start a retail business at one of the markets. He has been having good luck and is able to send money monthly back to the village. Bermet is also working hard to provide for her children - she has a dairy business. The herd was started 20 years ago with 10,000 KGD. Bermet's hard work has expanded the herd to five milk cows and yields monthly profits of 10,000 som KGS. In order to further expand her herd, Bermet has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan which she will use to buy more cows. She will use the profits from the loan to buy more livestock and save money for home repairs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1478956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

Zamira has a high school education and lives with her spouse and mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law is a pensioner and her husband helps with the housework. Zamira is the main source of income for her family from raising livestock, which she began three years ago by buying a cow for 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. Thanks to Zamira's hard work, her farm now has two cattle and 15 sheep. Also she has her garden at home in which she has planted many fruit trees, such as: apricot, persimmon, and pomegranate. Also she has a small plot of land on which to grow barley, wheat, corn, and tomatoes. Zamira together with her spouse, prepared for a very good harvest because they have experience, and most importantly, they put their heart and soul into their work. Every day early in the morning Zamira's husband drives the cattle to pasture and gives them to the shepherd, every night the cattle return home. During this time, Zamira cleans the barn, harvests hay, and gets fresh water. Twice a year Zamira sheers the sheep for wool. Their monthly income is 10,000 Kyrgyzstani Somoni. In order to further develop their farm, Zamira appealed to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to purchase sheep for livestock breeding. With the income from the loan, Zamira plans to invest further in multiplying their amount of domesticated animals, and plans to accumulate funds for material support of the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sheep.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kulundu Village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-26T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-25T22:30:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":512.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T01:31:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":638681,"name":"Nongue Taaba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mr HAMIDOU est responsable du groupe NONGUE TAABA.

Ainur has secondary education. \r\n\r\nAs a main source of income for her family, Ainur works with livestock breeding, after having started five years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ainur's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow with offspring. Ainur's farm is at her house, where she has conditions for breeding livestock. The monthly income is 5,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Ainur turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase bull-calves to fatten and subsequently sell at the market for a higher price.

Her husband works as an electrician and receives a small salary, which is not enough to support the whole family. Therefore, as a main source of income for her family, Zeynegul decided to work with livestock breeding, like many other inhabitants in her village. She started 8 years ago with the purchase of livestock for 10,000 som (KGS), and she now has a good income. \r\n\r\nThanks to Zeynegul's persistent work, her farm currently has a dairy cow and 25 sheep, and also a plot of land of 1.60 hectares of land, on which she grows barley and hay. Zeynegul has good conditions for breeding cattle. Currently she and her family already prepared the fodder for her livestock: 2 carts of hay and 100 bundles of pressed hay. She also feeds the livestock with barley which she grows on her plot of land. The monthly income is 7,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Zeynegul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan to purchase foals for fattening and subsequently selling at the market, at a higher price. Zeynegul plans to invest the income from the loan in further increasing the number of livestock. She also intends to save money for purchasing a new car for her

She works at the business throughout the week, from morning to night. Sia says that the main challenge to her business is storage facilities.\r\n\r\nSia has requested a loan in order to buy more fish for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and to grow her business. In the future, she plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":24.85,"image":{"id":1478467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more fish for resale.

He earns money to feed the cattle, take care of daily expenses, and of course to help his son.\r\n\r\nLike all farmers, Abdunaim works from morning to evening and cares for the animals afterwards. His colleague and friend advised him to buy another cow to increase his income, but he does not have enough cash in hand to buy one. Abdunaim decided to apply for a loan and hopes for financial support. He thanks Arvand in advance.

This is also the place of the famous straw hats. \r\nThis is where se\u00f1ora Lorena lives.  She is 42-years old, is separated and had three children in that relationship.  Two of her children are already grown.  The youngest is 14-years old and goes to high school.  A 5-year old granddaughter also lives with do\u00f1a Lorena.  She is like a daughter to do\u00f1a  Lorena, as they have been together since her granddaughter was small.  She goes to school also. \r\nDo\u00f1a Lorena is a very kind and friendly person who likes to work to get ahead, even more so now that she is alone. She makes her living selling all kinds of products, depending on the season.  She sells clothing, shoes, sheets, gems and toys, among other products.  She goes to the city of Cuenca to buy the gems, as they are much cheaper there.  She sells her products by going to her customers and leaving the items on credit.  She collects payments on a weekly basis.  Do\u00f1a Lorena has been running her business for fifteen years, which is why she has such a large clientele. \r\nThis loan is for the purchase of clothing, sheets, shoes and toys.  Do\u00f1a Lorena has been with the communal bank for three loan cycles.  She likes the communal bank because with the help of the loans, everything is easier.  Do\u00f1a Lorena's dream is to give her daughters the best education.

She is an 18-year-old from Waterloo2 eastern area in Freetown. She is single with no child for now.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Mariatu established her palm oil business. She began her business because she wants to generate a permanent source of income to empower herself. She works at the business from 8:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., seven days per week. She says that the main challenge to her business is insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nMariatu requires a loan in order to purchase more palm oil to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to take care of her parent and increase her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mariatu plans to expand her business more than ever.

San Luis Acatl\u00e1n is famous for its warm people and its part of the Mixteca Nahua-Tlapaneca region.  \n\nMr. Adalberto is 66 years old.  He has lived in the small community of San Miguel all his life, and he has never left it.  He has two jobs - the first one he has had since his childhood as a farmer in farms of different ownerships.  The second one, and in his own words his favorite, is being a proud grandfather of his four grandchildren.  Mr. Adalberto lives with his four grandchildren and his daughter in a small household that lacks energy access.  In order to have light Mr. Adalberto has to walk two hours to the nearest town to buy candles, a task he has been doing since his childhood once a week.  \n\nHowever, some weeks ago Mr. Adalberto noticed something new at his work.  Almost all the owners of the farms he works for have installed solar home systems to light their hectares.  This made Mr. Adalberto realize that he could work harder and purchase one of those solar home systems for his household.

Nine very energetic, entrepreneurial women joined together in one neighborhood and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank called \u201cLas Flores\u201d or \u201cThe Flowers\u201d. Their goal is not only to improve their own lives but also the lives of their families and their community. The group is about to begin its third loan cycle with Friendship Bridge.\r\n\r\nLisethee, a 53 year old mother of four children, recently joined the group. Two of her four children are already in college and this motivates Lisethee to maintain and develop her small cafeteria, which is part of her home. Quite happily, the business is enjoying increasing success and she has hired two more people to assist her. Lisethee is currently applying for her first loan from Friendship Bridge which she will invest in the cafeteria, buying more cooking supplies as well as staples for food preparation and drinks.\r\n\r\nLisethee appreciates the microcredit and educational program offered by Friendship Bridge. She sees what a huge impact the program has on the lives of women because it allows them to gain the necessary tools to move forward in their lives. They are able to grow in so many ways and give their children opportunities like education, improved nutrition, better health that the women never had as children.

She takes care of their three children. For about six years, she managed a restaurant, but sales fell sharply, which forced her to close because she didn't have the working capital to sustain the business. She is currently employed at a business, working as a food handler. Also, to complement her income, she works by selling merchandise that she offers to family, friends, and acquaintances. This allows her to pay household expenses. <br \/><br \/>Mery's humbleness, strength, and attitude of self-improvement motivated her to request her third loan to invest in buying wholesale merchandise (perfume, clothing, accessories, body cream, and more). This will allow her to stock up on the products she needs to satisfy the growing demand during the Christmas season.

Many of the eight women who form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cTikal\u201d create handmade textiles including ornate blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d, and other creations. Other women work in animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nTomasa is a 38-year-old widow and is the Secretary of the Trust Bank. The group is in its third loan cycle. She has been a widow for eight years and works diligently to take care of the basic needs of her five children. Tomasa raises animals including chickens and pigs. She is quite happy to receive a new loan which she will use to purchase 20 additional chickens and 2 pigs. She will also buy feed to fatten them. Her dream is to increase her business, creating more income so that she can continue to support her family. As many of the women in the Friendship Bridge program, Tomasa wants her children to complete their education, something that she was unable to do. At the present time, one child attends the 2nd grade, two are in 4th grade, and the last one is in 6th grade. Tomasa only reached the 4th grade.\r\n\r\nTomasa shares that she enjoys being a part of this Trust Bank.

The eldest son lives and works in the capital of Kyrgystan and helps the family financially, while the youngest son lives with the parents and helps with the farm. Begimjan has a high school degree and she raises livestock for a living. She started six years ago with 8,000 som KGS. Her diligent work expanded the herd and now Begimjan owns fifteen sheep. Begimjan re-sells the sheep at the local market after fattening them and makes 5,000 som KGS monthly profit this way. In order to further increase her herd Begimjan applied for a loan with micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" which she will use to buy more sheep. She plans to get more sheep with the profits from the loan and eventually plans to save enough money to purchase her son a

","en":"Zahro is a wonderful woman. She is an exemplary Tajik lady and a hardworking and caring mother of two children. Zahro is providing for her children by herself as her husband has passed away and she is a widow. It was hard for her to provide her kids with everything necessary, but due to her diligence and hard work she is able to raise them well. Her eldest son also helped his mother to provide for the family, but he has been drafted into the army now. Her second son is too young and still attends school. Zahro works as a saleswoman in a buffet-style restaurant. She diligently performs her duties. Her youngest son has needed a computer for a few years now, but Zahro's small salary made it impossible for her to purchase one. Now Zahro has requested a loan of 1500 somoni which she will use to buy the computer. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":23.24,"image":{"id":1479050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

She has an unfinished college degree and is a professional accountant. Currently Natalia works at the farming co-op's office as a head secretary and her colleagues know her as a hardworking, honest and wise woman. To supplement her salary Natalia raises livestock. She started 22 years ago by purchasing cattle with 16,000 som (KGS). She worked hard to save money and expand her business and now owns two milk cows and two pregnant cows as well as 8.6 acres of land where she grows wheat, oats and feeder legume Onobrychis\/Lucerne. Her monthly profits are 20,000 som (KGS). In order to further expand her business, Natalia has turned to the micro-finance bank \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan. She will use the loan to buy steers for fattening and resale at the livestock market. Natalia plans to invest the profits from the expansion into further growing her herd.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy steers for fattening and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Frunze village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-18T21:51:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":638052,"name":"Hazel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hazel is 44 years old and lives in Blis Culo, Molave Zamboanga del Sur.

She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\nFlorencia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a retail store that sells inexpensive items, often with a single price for all items in the store. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 700 in sales every day.\r\nShe is requesting a Php 15,000 loan to help her continue the operation of her business. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.\r\nFlorencia dreams that her business will continue to grow and hopes her family can have their own house.

The family is well respected in the village. \r\n\r\nTo earn additional income for her family, Mairamkul raises animals, a business she started 26 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to her hard work, she now has three milk cows as well as 0.57 hectares of arable land on which she grows corn, with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. With the goal of further developing her business, Mairamkul has turned to microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan to purchase sheep for fattening and resale in the marked for a higher price. She plans to invest profits from the loan into further augmentation of her herd, and to save toward the education of her youngest daughter at a prestigious university.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

So this is how she came to learn the business and when she got together with her partner, he was unable to cover all of the household expenses and she decided to help out financially so she started her own business making tortillas. She works every day from 10 in the morning until 5 in the evening.\r\n\r\nAna needs to invest more in her tortilla business and do to this she needs to buy more supplies so she can increase her production and satisfy all of her customers' needs. With the loan she will be able to buy corn and firewood, which are her main raw materials for making the tortillas.\r\n\r\nAna dreams of having her own mill, since she has to walk about a kilometre to grind the corn and makes the dough from this. She also plans to start studying next year because she is finding it difficult not being able to read or write and of course she wants to help her children with their schooling so that they do not have the same difficulties that she has had to face over the last few years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.64,"image":{"id":1477160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy corn and firewood, for making tortillas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2014-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.08},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.26},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":35.64,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":35.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439716525,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-27T19:00:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637143,"name":"Demesio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Demesio tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa en el distrito de Yamango, su poblaci\u00f3n se dedica a la agricultura, comercio y ganader\u00eda, ubicada en Morropon \u2013 Piura, costa norte del Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nEl se dedica a la crianza de ganado vacuno, comercio de pl\u00e1tano, granos y ventas de todo tipo distribuyendo a de su parcela hasta los caser\u00edos aleda\u00f1os.\n<p>\nHa solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo de 3 000 nuevos soles para la compra de un veh\u00edculo mototaxi que le permitir\u00e1 distribuir sus productos en las zonas aleda\u00f1as a su comunidad.\n\n","en":"Demesio, 56, lives with his wife in the Yamango district, whose population makes their living in agriculture, trade and cattle raising.

She and her husband are raising a son, their only child, who is in the 7th grade. Anarkan\u2019s husband has secondary education and earns a supplementary income by working as a seasonal construction worker. Anarkan has finished   technical college. In the past, she worked for many years as a dairy maid.  At present, as the main source of income for her family, Anarkan raises livestock. She launched this business 30 years ago by buying livestock for 500 KGS. Thanks to Anarkan\u2019s hard work, her farm now has five dairy cows and 1 ha [2.5 acres] of land, where she grows rice and clover every year. After harvesting rice, Anarkan sells her rice to resellers for cash, which brings in a decent income. She uses clover as animal fodder year round. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to develop her business further, Anarkan has applied to the Bai Tushum & Partners microfinance institution for a loan to increase her livestock by buying cattle.

He is 31 years old.  He is a married young man.  He has four children.  Shamsuddin lives with his parents and wife.  They have a large family.  Shamsuddin is a serious and pleasant person.  He achieved a lot in life through his labor and effort.  After finishing school, his parents could not help him to get accepted to a university.  Shamsuddin really wanted to get accepted to the Academy and become a policeman.  He worked for the first years without getting into a university.  Because he is the only son in the family, he had to think about his mother and father first.  With his persistence and drive, he finally got accepted to the Academy.  Now Shamsuddin is studying on a contractual basis in the part-time division of the Academy of the Tajikistan Republic.  He also works for the police.  Once he finishes his studies, he will be able to get promoted at work.  Shamsuddin cannot currently pay for his studies because he has to provide for a large family alone.  He takes care of his parents and his family.  This is why he is awaiting support and help from You.  Shamsuddin is an active client of Humo.  Previously, he obtained a consumer loan to pay for education.  Having learned that Humo offers loans for education, he is happy to obtain his next loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1480136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Her oldest daughter is married, second son is married and works in Russia, and helps the mother financially by sending a portion of his salary to her in Kyrgyzstan, and the youngest son lives with Zaripakhan.  He works at a flourmill.  Zaripakhan has a secondary education. To provide the primary income for her family, Zaripakhan is involved in animal husbandry, having started 22 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 5,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Zaripakhan's hard work, today her business contains 3 dairy cows and also a 0.73 hectare land plot, where she grows sunflowers and corn. The monthly income amounts to 12,000 som (KGS).

She and her husband are raising five children. Two daughters are married and live on their own. The two oldest sons are working in Russia, helping the family financially by sending their salaries home to Kyrgyzstan to support the family. Unfortunately this is not enough, so Bazarkhan farms and keeps livestock as the family's main source of income. She started this business 32 years ago when she bought livestock with 3,000 KGS. Because of Bazarkhan's hard work, her farm now boasts five dairy cows, one horse, and a 1 hectare plot of land where she grows peppers, corn, watermelons, a small apple orchard. This brings in a good income. Every year, Bazarkhan reaps a good crop of apples which she sells wholesale in the local market. Her monthly income is 15,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Bazarkhan approached microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy calves to fatten and resell for a profit. Bazarkhan plans to invest the profits she makes from the loan into further increasing her livestock, and she is saving enough money to send her youngest son to a prestigious university. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.02,"image":{"id":1480306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy calves to fatten and resell.

She is married, and she and her husband, Samagan, are raising four children. Medina has a secondary education. Immediately after graduation, she married Samagan. Her husband is a taxi driver. He makes a small but consistent income. Medina is not idle. She is busy with household chores and children. Medina farms and keeps livestock to provide the family's main source of income. Medina started farming seventeen years ago when she bought 2,000 KGS worth of livestock. Thanks to Medina's hard work, her farm now boasts one bull, forty sheep, and three hectares of land where she grows beans and perennial herbs. Medina's husband helps her a great deal.

The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Adeera who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1479019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":" buy more dryers, rollers, trolly cart, and braids","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Abaita Ababiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-11-27T19:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-26T19:30:01Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adeera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":170102},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":196044},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":218066},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":234104},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176247},{"due_date":"2015-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":182613},{"due_date":"2015-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":189210},{"due_date":"2015-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":203126},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":210463},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":225943},{"due_date":"2015-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":242560},{"due_date":"2015-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":251522}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.22},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.65},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.5},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.04},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.38},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-02T21:34:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":637035,"name":"Francisca De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisca vive en casa propia con sus dos hijas y su esposo, ella posee una tienda donde vende art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como:  frijoles, leche, huevos, pan, aceites, golosinas, refrescos, entre otros, tiene 8 a\u00f1os con su negocio y eso le ha regalado experiencia en las ventas que le permite obtener las mejores ganancias, est\u00e1 ubicada en su lugar de residencia, es muy reconocida por los vecinos de la zona , se ha hecho de mucha clientela, pues tiene la tienda surtida, ella quiere acrecentar el negocio y realizar una nueva inversi\u00f3n pero necesita de capital por eso solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar lo necesario para su tienda, asegura que cancelara la deuda y a la vez conf\u00eda en que le dar\u00e1 a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Francisca lives in a home of her own, along with her husband and two daughters.

","en":"Tazagul is 50 years old, a widow and raised 3 children alone.  Her oldest daughter is married, second son is married and works in Russia, and helps the mother financially by sending a portion of his salary to her in Kyrgyzstan, and the youngest son lives with Tazagul.  He is unemployed.  Tazagul has a secondary education. She is very kind, responsive, hardworking and complaisant.  Any work gets done in her hands. To provide the primary income for her family, Tazagul is involved in animal husbandry, having started 29 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 4,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Tazagul's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 17 sheep and also a 1.0 hectare land plot, where she grows corn, and also has a small garden at home, where she grows tomatoes, peppers and pumpkins. She grows corn to provide her livestock with the feed.  The monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS).
