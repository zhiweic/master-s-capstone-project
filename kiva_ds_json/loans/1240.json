Zebo and her husband run their own livestock and agricultural business, but every time they make a profit, they have to spend all of the money on family necessities.  Zebo wants to expand their business in order to make more money to better satisfy the needs of her family.  She wants to purchase a few head of cattle to fatten and to sell.  She does not, however, have the financial resources to spend on the purchase of cattle.  Zebo therefore turned to Arvand for a loan to buy livestock.  Zebo is hoping for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their support.

She has lived in her sister's house for 3 years along with her 4 little-ones. She has a little agricultural land that she inherited from her mother and she grows small quantities of beans, potatoes, and barley. Sometimes she uses these crops for her own food and, when the prices are very high, she sells them in the city of Juaja. But, as she tells us, on days when she doesn't have to tend her crops, she works for other farmers. For this reason, her main economic activity is raising animals such as pigs, sheep, and bulls, which she buys in order to later sell them at a higher price to the butchers who come to her house because they know her trade. At the moment, because of a lack of capital, she doesn't have many animals to fatten. She hopes to be able to work with her loan group and, little by little, to get the quantity of animals she needs to make better profits.

She lives with her husband, Juan, with whom she has one son who they are bringing up in the house that they built a year ago. She works from the early hours of the morning growing various greens as well as peas and potatoes. \"Along with my husband, I work the land. Being there and seeing my crops grow is my greatest reward\", she says. 5 years ago, she began working for herself in the fields that she inherited from her parents. Now she applies all the knowledge that she's learned since she was a little girl to those fields. She says that, without doubt, her crops will be bought for a good price in the major markets in the city where she sells her produce every 4 months, when it's ready. Now she wants to improve her income in order to buy more agricultural land and have better production and greater profits. She hopes that, with the money that she saves and the income she gets from her livestock, she will reach her goal. This is her second loan from KIVA and in all this time she has shown herself to be a responsible person and committed to her loan group. She promises to be punctual in making her repayments.

He is happily married and has 4 dependent children.  Abdujalil lives in a rural area and loves nature and animals, especially horses.  As a hardworking man, he is constantly striving to attain all of the essentials for his family and his children.  Long ago he decided to start his own business, and he landed upon livestock.  He raises and sells cattle, and also engages in animal husbandry as a way to make extra money.  He currently owns a few head of cattle, which he is raising and will sell soon.  Abdujalil wants to further expand his business, but for this he needs to buy a few more head of cattle.  Abdujalil thus turned to Arvand for a loan to purchase livestock.

Ayjamal has a higher education and works as a teacher in the local school.  Ayjamal's work in animal husbandry has served as the major source of income for her family beginning 17 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to Ayjamal's hard work, she has 2 milk cows, 5 horses, and 30 sheep.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS.  With the goal of increasing the number of livestock in her care, Ayjamal turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan of 45,000 KGS.

for her to cope with her family expenses.  She is 37 years old and is the foster mother of 2 children.  She is a light in the lives of these children and is their only hope.  Seven years ago she started her own business purchasing and selling fabric in the local market.  She has her own trading stall in the local market and primarily sells fabric for sewing women's clothing because the demand is greater.

She is a mother of two children. She adores her family and her husband works very hard so that his family can have a good and respectable life. Her husband owns an unstitched clothing business which is the only source of income for the family. Presently he needs additional capital for the growth of his business. For that Muqadas, as a member of a two-person lending group, has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan for her husband to purchase a variety of clothes to sell so that he can respond quickly to customer needs. With the help of the profit he will put aside some savings to pay for the electricity and gas bill. Muqadas hopes that the loan will be helpful for her husband's business.

Vanh is originally from a rural village of the Moung Russey district of Battambang province, Cambodia. To struggle for a living, she and her husband do rice paddy farming on three hectares of farmland to support the family. The current business earns their family about 42,500 KHR (Cambodia Riels) per day to meet the family\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nThe main challenge for her business is too many insects and weeds. Those are reasons why their rice cannot grow well. To overcome this challenge, Vanh joins a group of two to get a new loan. This is the fifth-cycle loan with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. The past loans, which she has repaid back, have improved her family's living conditions, much better than before.

The couple receives monthly retirement pension payments.  Lamara works at the local water company and Valiko is a welder, working on special projects from the house.  They work hard to cover food and every day costs.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate more income Lamara has decided to apply for a loan and restart a business trading household items among her community members.  Lamara used to trade linens and blankets nearly five years ago and has experience in this field.  With the loan she will travel to Turkey (neighboring country) and purchase a stock of merchandise for resale.  Clothing and household items are cheaper in Turkey than in Georgia and transportation costs are not expensive.

On getting a profit, first of all she will repay the loan to Kiva and than she wants to build a new room in the salon, as the space in the salon is too congested. She hopes that her business grows more and she is very much thankful to both BRAC and Kiva."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":82.78,"image":{"id":1449864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Each one of them is married with school-going children, and has two acres of land to till for their sustenance.\r\n\r\nEmily is the elder one among them (second from right). She has four children in primary school, and she and her husband are farmers. Tea is their main source of income but they also grow maize, beans, potatoes, and vegetables for their food. They also have three dairy cows, a few goats, and traditional chicken for their food and milk as well. Income from tea and sale of milk is used for their family needs, and the little saving they put aside in the group account helps them get a credit from VEP.\r\n\r\nEmily and her cousins have been partnering with VEP with an aim of benefiting from the biogas project that will enable them to save money spent on buying charcoal and kerosene, while also saving them the time and energy spent collecting firewood. \r\n\r\nThey appreciate that their lives will improve by having biogases constructed for them since they will also have smoke-free kitchens. Emily is happy that with biogas, she can use the time previously used for collecting firewood, to have a family time.\r\n\r\nWith the biogas, her children and husband will be able to warm their food even in her absence without waiting for her to come and light the fire. This will make her work easier and her family will enjoy the convenience. \r\n\r\nBio-slurry will be an added advantage in that they will not have to buy fertilizer anymore. With this, there is no doubt their crop production will increase and this will ensure food security for her family.\r\n  "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":715.65,"image":{"id":1444985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","use":"to construct a Bio-Digester.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kiambu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.166667 36.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":257,"posted_date":"2013-10-19T09:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-18T09:10:02Z","loan_amount":5725,"lender_count":185,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pauline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":5725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2013-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20883},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19691}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.12},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":477.1,"local_amount":41668,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T23:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41769.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429639970,"comment":null},{"amount":238.55,"local_amount":20834,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T15:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20884.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439867623,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T20:00:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":618903,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is a 28-year-old married man with 3 children living in Fort Portal, Uganda.

is a 32-year-old married man with two children. \r\n\r\nHe is a trained clinical officer and works at the community health center. He is the third born in a family of five and takes care of his parents and two siblings. \r\n\r\nJulius ventured into the retail trade in 2011 to trade in mobile phone accessories and general merchandise, since his employment income was not sufficient to take care of his extended family. He later partnered with a local telecommunications company to offer mobile money transfer services to the community from his shop. He has employed one shop attendant to coordinate the money transfer services and attend to customers in need of other products from the shop. The business has been doing well so far. \r\n\r\nIn response to the recurring costs and health effects associated with candles and paraffin lamps that are commonly used in the area, Julius introduced the solar lanterns from BrazAfric in the year 2012. Electricity is only available at shopping centers and therefore the products got a very good reception because of their economic and social benefits. They provide safe and bright lighting and come with a mobile phone charging function. Their demand has since gone up and now he cannot buy adequate stocks to meet the demand. \r\n\r\nJulius has been buying the lanterns for cash. From the Kiva financing option at BrazAfric, he is now seeking financing to purchase the solar lanterns for stocking and selling to the community.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

I think that is the most prestigious university in Central Asia which has American system of studies. In the future, when I become a highly qualified lawyer, I want to help people in my country.

He is married and has six children, aged between one and fourteen years. He has been in the business of farming for the past 20 years. He would like to use a Kiva loan to support labor costs and buy fertilizer during maize production. He needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase the plants' production of maize. With profits from his farming, he wishes to invest in his business, so that in the future he will be able to acquire machines and tractors that would enhance his farming capacity.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He also ventured into public transport three years ago, obtaining an extra income. He says that every day while he works with the car, his wife works in the butcher\u00b4s shop. Now he is thinking of acquiring a better-equipped car, with which he will be able to transport city people to the countryside. He is also thinking of acquiring machines for cutting meat, so that he will have a more productive butcher\u00b4s shop with all kinds of sausages, with which he hopes to earn a better income so that he can give his son an education.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan with Kiva, which is why he is thankful for the financial support provided to him. It will help him to make progress in his business. He also promises to be punctual with his loan payments. Rolando will invest the 3000 soles in the purchase of several pounds of animal meat (lamb, beef and pork), with which he will supply his butcher\u00b4s shop as usual.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1452959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy wholesale meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-19T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-18T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-19T20:09:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621098,"name":"Narciso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Narciso, es una persona de 64 a\u00f1os de edad, es viudo y tiene un hijo.

Her family consists of 6 children and her partner.  They work in agriculture, planting and cultivating coffee, and they also make coffee seedlings, which is her specialty.  Lourdes has a 4th grade education.  From a very early age, her parents taught her to work the land, because they could not support her in her education due to a lack of resources.  She's been working with her husband for 18 years.  They own the land that they work, thanks to a purchase that they made with the earnings that they had obtained from prior harvests.

She would also like to finish fixing up her home because it needs work, including plastering, fixing the roof, which has deteriorated a bit, etc.  Her dream is to save, so that she can provide her

This issue must be approached very carefully.  Analyzing many universities of our country, I realized that AUCA is the perfect choice for me because it is one of the best universities in Central Asia. AUCA provides modern equipment that helps students during their studies. One of the important advantages of AUCA is that all the courses are taught in English. Another unique feature of this university is that students can choose their timetable suitable to them, as well as choose the most important academic classes. AUCA students have a chance to continue their studies abroad. \r\n\r\nI am a very sociable person and have lots of interests. I am interested in economics and politics, as well as journalism and psychology. That\u2019s why it was really difficult to choose one of those departments. Then I ended up with the department of International and Comparative Politics, because from the ancient times, different countries had political inter-relations. Therefore, international relations became more important in politics.  Another opportunity is that every student of AUCA can apply for a Kiva loan. Kiva loans help AUCA students to cover their tuition fees. I would also like to apply for a Kiva loan so that I don\u2019t have to think about the financial problems of a student\u2019s life.\u201d

She lives in her own home along with her husband and children.  Delmira works in agriculture.  She began many years ago with her parents and now works with her husband.  Their main products are beans, plantains and yucca. At harvest they take their products to the market for sale.  She has been working in this field for five years.  It was her mother who gave her the push to begin working in this field.  At first circumstances were difficult because bad weather made them lose their crop and they were left without any income or cash flow.  They had to start all over.  Thanks to God and to their hard work they have been able to move forward and have a stable business that generates income.  As an additional source of income Delmira works selling grilled foods in the afternoon from the sidewalk in front of her house. This is the first loan that she is requesting through Kiva.  She is very grateful for the economic support that she has received, and she promises to be punctual in her repayments and at group meetings.  She is asking for 2000 Nuevos Soles (Peruvian currency) and she will invest the money in organic fertilizers in order to improve her fields and to kill some weeds on her land.

Four of them go to school, and one helps them with the chores at home. Thus these are the people who depend on Jorge. \r\n\r\nHe works butchering pigs. He has done this work for two years. Earlier, he only bought and sold the pigs, but a friend taught him how to butcher them. He also does agricultural work in his free time, when the sale of pork is steady. He cultivates corn and beans. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is requesting from the Campo Foundation is to buy more pigs to butcher, and he will also buy chickens to fatten up. He is planning for the Christmas season, when they will be ready to butcher and he will be able to sell them. With the loan he will obtain more earnings for his family and thus get ahead. \r\n\r\nHis dreams are to have a pig and poultry farm, to sell the animals when they are grown, or to sell them to customers who want to buy them when they are small. In this way he would be able to provide jobs to friends who do not have work, because if they go out to sell the meat, that would be a source of income for other families.

She is from one of the municipalities of Chinandega, a zone which is characterized by its commerce and is where one of the country's largest sugar factories is located. She sells general merchandise including a variety of styles of clothing for both children and adults such as purses, pants and shoes; cosmetics and shampoo; and other nicknacks. She sells from home or by foot, in which case she leaves very early from her home to distribute merchandise to her customers. She makes her purchases with cash at various markets and sells for either cash or credit both to returning and one-time customers.

El dinero solicitado de S\/.2000 nuevos soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de madera, clavos , entre otros materiales para arreglar su puesto de venta, ya que dicho negocio se encuentra en las afueras de su casa (al aire libre).\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is 35 years old and lives in her own home accompanied by her husband and three children. She is a responsible and hard-working woman. Mar\u00eda sells food during the day and barbeque in the evening, outside her house. She started doing this five years ago, looking for a way to generate new income to raise her family's standard of living. It was her mother that suggested this field as she had lots of experience in selling food. Thus mother's helping hand initiated the business and little by little it grew and gained clients who liked the food. Shortly after Mar\u00eda suffered a great loss. Her mother died. Mar\u00eda was quite depressed and didn't take good care of the business. But thanks to the support she had at all times from her family, she was able to move ahead and get the business going. Maria hopes to continue to expand and open a restaurant in the same city. She hopes to increase her revenues and raise the quality of living of her family. \r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's first loan with Kiva. She is very grateful for the financial support and promises to pay her installments on time. She has requested 2,000 PEN which will be invested purchasing wood, nails and other materials to fix up her sales stand, given that it is located outside her house (in the open air)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":155.22,"image":{"id":1453746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy wood, nails, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tarapoto","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T00:00:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":206.23},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":221.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":237.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":241.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":254.54},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":270.23},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":278.96},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":289.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.46},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.27},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.96},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.12},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.76,"local_amount":206.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":206.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905787,"comment":null},{"amount":80.46,"local_amount":221.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":222.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091774,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-21T20:21:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621655,"name":"Alex De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alex de 30 a\u00f1os,  estudio hasta octavo grado, es casado;  su esposa se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n  de flores artificiales, este negocio lo hace en las casa,  tiene tres hijos (7, 3 a\u00f1os de edad y la reci\u00e9n nacida de un mes). \n\nAlex trabaja en un hotel como ordenanza,  tiene un a\u00f1o de dedicarse a ese trabajo un amigo lo motivo a buscar ese empleo y quedo trabajando.

She has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The start-up loan program provides business start-up loans with soft conditions to informal businesses that do not have access to credit products. So this loan is very important for Karine, to purchase a computer that she needs for her work. She awaits your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":65.18,"image":{"id":1450383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to pay for a computer to provide accounting services.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Vanadzor town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T06:20:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8313.8},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8810.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":8945.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9192.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":9011},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":9664.9},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9701.7},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9748.5},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9718.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10118.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10108.9},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10263.4},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10487.6},{"due_date":"2014-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":10456.5},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10911.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10907.3},{"due_date":"2015-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":11027.9},{"due_date":"2015-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11364.9},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11451.6},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11621},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11769.1},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11967},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":12107.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12329.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.03},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.37},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.98},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.17},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.25},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.3},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.42},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.06},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.92},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.03,"local_amount":8412.2,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8569.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420157534,"comment":null},{"amount":22.03,"local_amount":8811.1,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T11:10:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8976.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430308629,"comment":null},{"amount":22.12,"local_amount":8851.4,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":9017.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439845912,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-20T13:23:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619374,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of five children, Eva works hard to support her family.

He will use this loan to help stock up on inventory, as well as to promote flyers and specials to the community.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":718.75,"image":{"id":1450402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase inventory and flyers for marketing family-owned grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"West New York","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":6575,"lender_count":169,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rafael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":6555,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":6575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":235.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":238.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":241.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":244.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":247.91},{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":251.01},{"due_date":"2014-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":254.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":257.32},{"due_date":"2014-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":260.54},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":263.8},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":267.09},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":270.43},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":273.81},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":277.24},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":280.7},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":284.21},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":287.76},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":291.36},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":298.69},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":302.42},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":306.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":310.03},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":313.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":239.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":242.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.59},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":248.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.78},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.33},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.61},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.9},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.26},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.64},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.09},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.64},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.25},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.9},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.6},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":303.34},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.14},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":310.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":476.18,"local_amount":474.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":476.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429528778,"comment":null},{"amount":242.57,"local_amount":241.83,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-24T09:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":242.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":441189210,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T18:00:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619349,"name":"Sheldon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After nine years of business in the window cleaning industry, Sheldon visited Accion Texas Inc. for a business loan to expand his company by hiring two part-time employees, purchasing new equipment, and obtaining working capital.\r\n\r\nSheldon says the expansion of his business will allow for more work opportunities.

Zoila makes a living in dressmaking.  Having started with just one sewing machine, Zoila has been doing this work for ten years and now has six different sewing machines in order to give a different finish to the clothes she makes.  The good work she produces means that her customers leave satisfied and recommend her to other people.  Zoila also buys clothes in Lima that she then sells, as well as selling the items that she makes.  Zoila runs her business in a small space where she can display her products.  She runs the business out of her home, where her customers come and Zoila treats them with a friendly manner.  Zoila decided to start his work as she left her job and needed a trade in order to earn an income.  Her neighbours wanted her to do this work when they saw the good-quality clothing that Zoila produces.  However, due to her age, Zoila is now physically tired of being in the same position all day to sew.  As a result, she would like to use her profits to start a grocery store.  This will be Zoila's sixth loan with Kiva.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her objectives.  Zoila promises to be punctual as she pays off her loans.

She sells items such as basic grains, frozen goods, detergents, sardines, sweets, fizzy drinks, eggs, and more.  Maritza is hard-working and has a big desire to do better. One objective for this loan is to invest more in her grocery store.  She will buy consumable products, such as frozen goods.  One of Maritza's dreams is to, one day, see her house finished and to expand and stock up her grocery store.  Martiza thanks Kiva investors for helping those of scarce resources and for helping poor countries, such as Nicaragua, to give people a decent job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":114.87,"image":{"id":1453790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy consumable products for the home, such as frozen foods, fizzy drinks, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chinandega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.616667 -87.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2015-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.89},{"due_date":"2015-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.94,"local_amount":1389.03,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1421.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429545923,"comment":null},{"amount":57.93,"local_amount":1413.01,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-19T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440199672,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-18T00:04:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":621668,"name":"Kelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kelly, de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, adem\u00e1s es muy atenta y amable con las personas.

Kelly is divorced from the father of her now adult and independent children. Kelly lives in her own house.  She makes a living selling good-quality clothes.  She offers different kinds of items which are in fashion for men, women, and children.  She buys all the products when she travels to Lima and then sells them out of her niece's house.  She sells to neighbours and friends, who prefer to buy from Kelly as she treats them in a polite and friendly manner.  Her customers recommend her to their friends.  Kelly believes that her business is profitable, given the income she earns from it.  Her profits allow her to cover her costs and to pay for her son's education.  Kelly decided to start this business because she needed an income to cover her household costs - before she did not have enough to pay for necessities.  This will be Kelly's sixth loan with Kiva and so she hopes to have Kiva lenders' support to continue working towards her objectives.  Kelly tells us that she likes the communal bank's work because of the support that it provides, helping those who need it.  With this loan of 1000 Nuevo Soles Kelly will buy a variety of clothes, and sweets to sell in her house.  Kelly will look for good prices and so increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":116.58,"image":{"id":1453794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy clothes in bulk, and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-10-20T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-19T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":158.96},{"due_date":"2013-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":170.79},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":177.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.61},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.44},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.97,"local_amount":151.93,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":157.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419905789,"comment":null},{"amount":59.61,"local_amount":158.96,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-25T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":164.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430091777,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-22T00:15:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":619427,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is asking for a loan because she believes that through it she will improve her business.\r\n\r\nThe previous loan enabled her to save money from her fruits and vegetables stall business.
