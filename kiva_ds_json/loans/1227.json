is from the village of Irind in the Aragatsotn region. She lives with her family and daughter. Svetlana has been a teacher in the local village school for many years. She is the only breadwinner of the family. Her salary of a teacher, however, is not enough to meet the everyday needs of her family. \r\n\r\nSvetlana is engaged in breeding livestock; cows, sheep, and hens, as well as in beekeeping. She cultivates potatoes, alfalfa, grass and walnuts. Svetlana's agribusiness currently needs some investment to function in a sustainable way. She needs a loan of USD 3000 to buy three calves, some forage for the livestock and to make credit repayments. She has already taken a loan from a local financial institution before, but unfortunately wasn't able to pay it back. However, thanks to hard work during recent times, Svetlana has been able to run her agribusiness in a sustainable way, ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments. Therefore, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

So, every day, Rosa goes out with her partner and they work very hard so that their children will have better opportunities in the future.  Rosa is a farmer and makes a living growing coffee, which she sells to neighbours, warehouses and intermediaries, at harvest-time.  Rosa is a mother to two children - they are still too young to go to school.  Rosa owns the land she works - her parents left her some of the land and she was able to buy the rest thanks to her efforts and sacrifice.  The plot of land is some two kilometres from her house, and she arrives there by foot.\r\n\r\nRosa has applied to \"Comixmul\" for a loan in order to buy five bags of manure, three litres of boron, and 50 loads of coffee for her crops.  With this she plans to expand her crops and strengthen the inheritance she will leave for her children.  Rosa's future plans are to improve her system at work - i.e. she wants to buy a machine so that she can work more accurately and quickly.  She would also like to produce a different variety of coffee - one that is better and more competitive in the market.  If she does this, she can earn a higher income and achieve her goals."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1444320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy farming supplies to look after her coffee crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Santa Rosa de Copan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":269,"posted_date":"2013-10-02T20:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-01T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-03T00:06:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615275,"name":"Leoncio Marco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El cliente es del sector de Orqu\u00eddeas en Guayaquil.

She earns a monthly income of 12,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Tursunbu approached the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding.

His biggest challenge is 'Drugs are expensive to buy.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Nyangera.'\r\n\r\nRobert was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'Dairy cow.' This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Gives loans and insures their farmers.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs.

30-year-old Aminata from Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married with two children aged three and seven years.  She began her business because she wanted to create an income to support her children and herself. In 2009, Aminata established her palm oil business.  She works at the business from 8:00am until 9:00pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nAminata requires a loan in order to purchase a gallon of palm oil to resell. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children and repay her loan. In the future, Aminata plans to own the biggest local food store in the community. She thanks you for your

After the death of her husband she raised three children on her own as well as taking care of her farm. Almakan has a specialist high school education and raises crops and livestock as the primary source of income for her family, something she began 23 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3,000 KGS. Thanks to Almakan's hard work, her farm now includes five sheep as well as 1.6 hectares of land under cultivation, on which she grows peppers, beans, clover, corn and beets every year, with a monthly income of 9,000 KGS.

She lives here with her husband and three children - ages 10, 6, and 3. Judith is 34 years old, has a diploma, and owns her own shop business. She believes she is hardworking, trustworthy, and very active in her community. Judith is involved in the women's group in her community.    \n\nThe community of Likindu village collects their drinking water from a river because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Likindu\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Likindu, 10 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water.  Judith has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Joseph, Shem, Gladys, and Beria.\n\nLikindu village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Judith believes that the dispenser will kill germs and prevent waterborne diseases that her family has suffered from in the past. The Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. The sale of carbon credits, to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Judith\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1439377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Vihiga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 34.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":"2013-10-03T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-02T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shem ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-04T18:10:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":612493,"name":"Flora's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora is 62 years old, has completed some primary school, and considers herself friendly and hardworking.

She is seen as reliable, trust worthy, and well known in her community.\n\nThe community of Marakalo B village collects their drinking water from a river because there is no piped water supply in this part of rural Kenya. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, often making Marakalo B\u2019s inhabitants sick and unable to work or attend school.\n\nA new chlorine dispenser offers a solution to the burden of sickness caused by unsafe drinking water. The dispenser is installed at the local water source, where users turn a valve to add chlorine to their jerricans, then collect water as usual. The chlorine disinfects the water and provides residual protection from recontamination. In Marakalo B, 50 households will benefit from having access to the dispenser and safe water.  Ann has volunteered to be the dispenser promoter, responsible for refilling the chlorine and encouraging the rest of the community to treat their water and keep themselves and their families healthy. There are four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Ann, Lilian, Joash, Rose, and Alfred. Marakalo B village needs a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining the dispenser. Ann believes that the dispenser will improve the community's health.  \n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

Thanks to this, he works today as an administrator for a farm in Eastern Antioquia [Antioquia is a department of Colombia]. He grows beans in a piece of land that the owner lent him and then sells the harvest at the marketplace in town. This is how he receives an additional income to cover the home expenses.\r\n\r\nMarco is a persistent, energetic and hardworking person who fights to get ahead. He is requesting a loan to buy agricultural supplies (insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers) to give maintenance to his plantations and have a more productive harvest in order to improve his income.

","en":"Sailigul is a caring mother of three adolescent children.  She is married.  Her husband has a low income and this is why she has to work hard to earn a living.  She was born in 1970 in the south of Tajikistan and grew up there.  Since childhood, she had helped her parents with the household and has gotten used to hard work since then.  She has been involved in her own business for over 12 years.  She is involved in buying and selling fruits.  She buys fruits wholesale from other districts and sells them retail at a local market.  She has her own retail outlet and tries to offer the highest quality fruits to the local residents.  She handles the business by herself.  She faces many difficulties in running the business and dreams that her children grew up and started helping her.  Sailigul intends to expand the selection of her products and is requesting a loan in the amount of 12000 somoni to buy fruits.  She awaits your kindness and hopes for your

Ryskan has a higher education. To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started 23 years ago with a purchase of livestock with 80,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Ryskan's hard work, today her business contains 2 dairy cows, 1 horse and 50 sheep. The monthly income amounts to 13,000 som (KGS). In order to further develop her business, Ryskan requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy a horse in order to increase livestock headcount.

People in her area pay a lot of money to have their phones charged, and Enise wants buy more 'Tipowa' and 'Powa Pak' products to help them out.

Francisca is originally from one of the towns in Chinandega, in the west of the country, and near to one of Nicaragua's largest volcanoes.  Francisca has a small business - she runs a bakery out of her home.  She works Monday to Friday, producing delicious pastries, such as doughnuts, pastries filled with meat, cheese, or pineapple, rolls, snacks, \"three milks\" cake, corn-flour drinks, and more.  Francisca started her business a few years ago and it has helped her to have a higher income for the household.

She is a widow who has been raising three children after her husband's death. She also runs her own farm. Bububatima has a vocational education, and the family's primary source of income is animal husbandry. Bububatima started this business 22 years ago when she bought livestock with 20,000 KGS. Due to Bububatima's hard work, the farm now has three dairy cows, two heifers, and ten sheep. She earns a monthly income of 7,000 KGS. In order to further develop her farm, Bububatima asked the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy cattle for breeding.  Bububatima plans to invest profits from the loan back into the livestock on her farm.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":331.95,"image":{"id":1444033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"buy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-10-03T17:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-02T17:50:07Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bububatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5636},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5120},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5269},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5423},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5581},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5744},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5911},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6084},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6261},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6444},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6632},{"due_date":"2014-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5895}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.05},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.15},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.61},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.98},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.44},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.03},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.69},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.48},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.38},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":116.75,"local_amount":5636,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5685.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419777250,"comment":null},{"amount":106.05,"local_amount":5120,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5165.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427100,"comment":null},{"amount":109.15,"local_amount":5269,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5315.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942645,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-10-23T16:53:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615766,"name":"H\u00e9ctor Iv\u00e1n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"H\u00e9ctor a sus 32 a\u00f1os de edad, es padre de 1 hijo de 9 a\u00f1os, por el que lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda para sacarlo adelante.

Por tal raz\u00f3n se hace necesario para m\u00ed solicitar el apoyo de Kiva, ya que puede servirme para cumplir mis metas acad\u00e9micas, profesionales y personales que se trazan al proyectarme en estudiar un doctorado en el exterior.\nTengo dos motivaciones para estudiar mi posgrado de doctorado en el exterior, en primer lugar porque en el \u00e1rea de mi inter\u00e9s que es la pol\u00edtica econ\u00f3mica y el desarrollo tiene unas excelentes escuelas y docentes ubicados principalmente en el pa\u00edses europeos y estadounidense; en este sentido, poder estudiar bajo la gu\u00eda conceptual y metodol\u00f3gica de quienes transforman la frontera de conocimiento es una excelente oportunidad para cualquier estudiante del mundo. Una segunda motivaci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s personal y est\u00e1 relacionada con el inter\u00e9s de realizar intercambios culturales y de conocimientos con personas de otros pa\u00edses que posiblemente tengan intereses similares.\n\nHe trabajado en investigaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, social y de evaluaci\u00f3n de impacto y esto me ha impulsado a trazarme una trayectoria educativa que incluye el estudio de un doctorado (PhD) que fortalezca y enriquezca mis conocimientos pr\u00e1cticos adquiridos. Adem\u00e1s, para m\u00ed ser\u00eda un motivo de orgullo y satisfacci\u00f3n poder contribuir al desarrollo de mi ciudad y de mi pa\u00eds, de poder por medio de estrategias y\/o programas bajo alianzas p\u00fablico-privadas, impactar positivamente en la mejora de la calidad de vida de las personas m\u00e1s vulnerables y del desarrollo econ\u00f3mico de mi ciudad. Por dichos antecedentes me interesa, realizar un doctorado en econom\u00eda como una ruta para cumplir mis metas de estudios y para fortalecer mis competencias laborales. La \u00fanica garant\u00eda que tengo es poner todo mi empe\u00f1o y dar lo mejor de m\u00ed.\n","en":"Marly is 26 years old and was born in Manizales, a city situated in the Colombian coffee-growing region. Thanks to her father's daily hard work as a taxi driver and her mother's work as a secondary school teacher, Marly studied economics at the University of Manizales. Her academic abilities enabled her to continue studying for a Masters, in which she was awarded the grade of merit for her thesis. \r\n\r\nMarly dreams of doing a PhD and support from Kiva would help her to pay to register for the exam of TOEFL and GRE, the translation of her academic documentation into English and the application to universities in the US and the UK. Once she has her PhD, Marly hopes to impact positively on public affairs by working on research into economics applied to real situations, bringing about changes and proposals on matters of policy which drive development and improve the quality of life of her city and the country. \r\n\r\nHere is her story:\r\n\r\nAlthough I have my family's support in achieving this dream, my parents cannot manage to cover such high costs as these due to their limited economic situation. Although I am currently working and saving, the money is not enough to cover the academic costs. For this reason it is necessary for me to ask for Kiva's help, as this can help me to reach my academic, professional and personal goals which are based on my plans to study for a PhD abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons for wanting to study for my PhD abroad; firstly because in my area of interest, which is economic policy and development, there are excellent schools and teachers located mainly in Europe and the US. In this sense, to be able to study under the conceptual and methodological guidance of the people who are at the cutting edge of their field is an excellent opportunity for any student in the world. My second reason is more personal and relates to my interest in intercultural exchange and meeting people from other countries who may have similar interests. \r\n\r\nI have worked in economic and social research and impact evaluation and this has motivated me to follow an educational path which includes a PhD which will strengthen and enrich the practical knowledge I already have. Moreover, it would give me pride and satisfaction to be able to contribute to the development of my city and my country, to be able to impact positively, via strategies and\/or programmes under a public-private alliance, on improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable people and the economic development of my city. For the above reasons I am interested in doing a PhD in economics as a way of fulfilling my study goals and to strengthen my employment skills. \r\n\r\nThe only guarantee I have is that I will put in the maximum effort and give the best of myself.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1445084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to cover the application costs to study for a PhD in economics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Manizales","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":237,"posted_date":"2013-10-03T18:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-11-02T18:20:01Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2730000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2014-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":227500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-10-05T13:32:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":615768,"name":"Lazos Unidos Y Rumbos Distintos Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cLAZOS UNIDOS Y RUMBOS DISTINTOS\u201d  se encuentra conformada por 05 socios quienes se encuentran contentos por estar pasando el 05 ciclo.

42-year-old Fatmata from the Waterloo Eastern area in Freetown. She is married and has 9 children ages 2 years to 25 years.  She began her business because she wants to create income to support her children and herself. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fatmata established her local foodstuff business.  She works at the business from 8:00 am until 9:00 pm, Monday to Friday. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and transportation difficulties.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase palm oil. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to pay her children's school fees and increase her business. In the future, Fatmata plans to own the biggest local food store in the community. She thanks you for your

She is married and has 2 children, ages 7 and 13, who live at home and attend school. Her husband is a builder. She has been running a table where she sells cosmetics. She is asking for a loan to buy enough cosmetics to increase her sales. She complains that the price of cosmetics is the major problem she faces now.  \r\n\r\nShe started this business with a little money from her husband. She enjoys her business because she makes her own money, and she is so proud of her business because it makes her independent. Her plans are to one day own a house, and to see her children attending university in the future. She appreciates the supporters of BRAC Liberia.
