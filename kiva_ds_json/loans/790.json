He lives together with his parents in their own home which is located in the town of Acostambo.  Hector is noted for being clever.  He studied to be an electrician.  He started out working in this field for a well-known company, specializing in welding.  He financed this from his previous job which he carried out in an important mine.  He is very good at what he does and so everybody knows him and sometimes they ask his advice, for which he earns extra money.  However, a short while ago he obtained his own car and he plans to use it to work in the public transport business, covering the routes between Huancayo and Jauja, two very busy cities.  He hopes to be very successful and make more income because his dream is to set up his own business and own an established ranch.  He has already taken his first step by purchasing bulls which he leaves in his mom's care because she knows how to care for and improve animals.\r\n\r\nThis is Hector's first loan from MFP and he hopes to receive your cooperation so that he can carry out his plans.  For his part, he pledges to make his repayments on time.  He enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Hector will invest the money he has requested in paying for the taxi route that he will begin working on."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1003222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for a taxi route","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T11:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":139.86},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":148.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":159.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":161.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":175.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":180.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":187.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":193.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":197.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.64},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.36},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.68},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.45,"local_amount":139.86,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":140.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099629,"comment":null},{"amount":52.57,"local_amount":140.19,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":141.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713768,"comment":null},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":147.37,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":148.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202661,"comment":null},{"amount":124.14,"local_amount":331.03,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":333.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098344,"comment":null},{"amount":60.89,"local_amount":162.38,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":163.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455568,"comment":null},{"amount":404.69,"local_amount":1079.17,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1087.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121610,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-28T02:34:41Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390672,"name":"Yeny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yeny, de 30 a\u00f1os es una hija ejemplar vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus padres y 3 hermanos a los que apoya en su casa propia, ubicada en la localidad del Tambo.

Instead she started to earn an income in the business of buying and selling clothes and beauty products, which she installed in her house. In the beginning she found it hard to find new customers. She went door to door with her products. Eventually and thanks to her hard work she made regular customers, who look for her and make orders.\r\n\r\nNow she has various orders for school uniforms. Things are going well for her; She decided to study a degree which she was interested in - \"Civil Engineering\". She has one year left to finish and already works in the local council as a works supervisor. Thanks to her capability, a group of architects recently contacted her to form part of a construction project where she will obtain a good wage while the project lasts.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and has many plans: \"My road is just starting, I want to specialize in highways\" she states.

He spends around 15 hours a day in his work and can serve up to four customers a month.  However, over the Christmas and New Year period he always has an increase in his sale of pigs because of the festivities.

She lives in a traditional family setting with her children in her late husband\u00b4s place, in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Tata was unable to attend school because of social reasons; she briefly attended Koranic school before leaving at a very early age to help her mother with her business activities. She worked by her mother\u00b4s side for several years before getting married, and benefited from a good commercial education which would enable her to get along better in the world of small retail. Tata tried out several revenue-generating activities before settling on the buying and resale of clothing. She has been selling clothes for 9 years and enjoys a good reputation and a large client\u00e8le. Her high sales figures are due to the quality of her high end clothing.\r\n\r\nTata is requesting this loan in order to be able to meet her customer demand. She has been a member of Soro Yiriwaso for 54 months and is on her 4th individual loan, having already fully repaid 4 group loans and 3 individual ones. She plans to use this loan to buy a bale of pagnes (highly decorative and colourful West African fabric). She gets her supplies locally from the Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (COMATEX) in S\u00e9gou and sells her merchandise for cash or credit to a client\u00e8le composed of men and women. She anticipates earning a monthly profit of 80 000 FCFA, which will allow her to cover some of her expenses (clothing, soap and medicine). Her aim is to build a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1006156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy some pagnes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757134,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251897,"comment":null},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410892,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449029,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502767,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502768,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268446,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498858,"comment":null},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102906,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243179,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T23:30:17Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":390076,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 43 years old.

She lives with her parents in a large traditional family in the S\u00e9gou district of Sokala (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAissa Kane left school in the 9th grade of fundamental class (Malian educational system) to work alongside her mother selling condiments, clothing and shoes. After several years of training, she branched out to conduct her own business activity and started to buy and sell potatoes, clothing, shoes, and school supplies at the start of the school year. She is highly skilled, and has enjoyed great notoriety and reputation over the past 12 years. \r\n\r\nIn order to bolster her working capital and increase her profits, she turned to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso six and a half years ago.

She lives together with Juan, her husband of 23 years.  The couple have six children, five of whom still live with them in their own home, in the town of Jatumpampa.  Mar\u00eda's main business activity is sowing tubers.  She grows potatoes, corn, olluco (a native tuber) and peas.  She has been working in this business for 20 years and her vast experience has helped her to save up the money she needed to buy her own farmland.  However, she admits that she needs still more plots of land for her crops and so every year she hires land and thereby enables her production.  Mar\u00eda very much enjoys her work.  It makes her feel alive and very peaceful, above all right now when she is experiencing some very bad problems.  However, she does not become discouraged, she knows that life goes on and she would like to do well for her children's sake.  Every harvest time, Mar\u00eda sells her crops in the country's capital.  However, sometimes the buyers come to her and buy her entire harvest.  In addition, Mar\u00eda also raises animals such as sheep which she sells when the need arises and sometimes uses for her own consumption.  \r\n\r\nMaria belongs to the 'Jatumpampa al Progreso' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

She lives with Victor, her husband of 23 years. They both have 8 children, but only live with 4 of them in their own house located in the annex of Ahuaycha. She owns various houses. Her motto is \u201chard work\u201d, so she doesn\u2019t rest. She has several lines of work that help her get ahead. In the morning, she bakes bread in the artisanal oven she built. She has a baker who helps them. With their car, her husband transports the bread to various townships in the area. They also own an omnibus that provides public transportation on the Acraquia-Pillo route, two townships that are well-travelled for economic reasons. They hired a driver from that area who administers the earnings with his son. That business does very well because there is almost no competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, her daughter-in-law tends to the grocery store that they have in their house and where they sell everyday items. As well as the animals that they breed, they have big and healthy corral chickens that they sell at every possibility.

Her main business activity is selling women's lingerie, comforters, bedspreads, blankets, etc.  She says that she goes out with her merchandise as she never knows when a customer will ask her for something.  She goes to another person's house where she works washing clothes and cleaning bedrooms, living room and patio.  They pay her a monthly wage for this which helps cover her financial expenses.  When she has finished her work, she walks through the streets offering her goods for sale.  She says that, thanks to her efforts, she now has regular customers but, as her sales are not constant, she also goes out to offer the products that she hasn't managed to sell.  Right now, she has lots of orders for the back-to-school season.  Some of her customers are already paying her gradually.  She leaves the clothing that she sells with her customers on credit and provides them with repayment terms.\r\n\r\nOlinda belongs to the \"Mujeres Solidarias\" community bank and this is her second loan from MFP.

He lives together with his wife and two children in a rented house, in Chilca district.  The city of Huancayo is very big and there is an awful lot of traffic.  For this reason, the locals travel around in taxis.  Rufo saw this need as an opportunity.  Four years ago he started offering a transport service with a car that he had just acquired and turned the car into his work tool.  Every day, from very early in the morning, he drives round the streets of his city in search of customers who ask him to transport them to different parts of the city.  He charges according to the distance traveled.  \"If the trip is in an urban area, I charge less but from cone to cone [outlying district to outlying district] the price is much higher\", he says  Rufo considers his work to be profitable because the service he offers is very much in demand.  In addition, he always tries, as far as possible, to cover the urban areas because in his business this means that he prolongs the life of his vehicle and delays wear and tear.  Rufo would like to improve his business and own an additional car so that he can make better profits.\r\n\r\nRufo is a member of the \"Las Emprendedoras\" community bank and this is his 19th loan from MFP.

Esta familia vive en una casa propia en la comunidad nativa Palomar, distrito de r\u00edo Negro, provincia de Satipo. Ismael es dedicado y meticuloso en sus quehaceres. Se dedica a la agricultura. En sus 3 cuadras de terrenos de cultivos siembra ma\u00edz, caf\u00e9 y cacao. De los cuales el caf\u00e9 y el cacao le brindan mayores ingresos, pero son anuales. Mientras tanto el ma\u00edz, se cosecha cada 4 meses, y es el producto que lo salva de algunos apuros como son las deudas, o gastos diarios. Empez\u00f3 en esta actividad desde muy joven. A sus 20 a\u00f1os ya contaba con terrenos propios. Y el caf\u00e9 es su especialidad.

The couple have three children but only live with two of them (who are 13 and 10 years old).  The family live in their own home which is located in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Ismael is committed and meticulous in his work.  His business is farming.  Over three 'cuadras' (unit of measurement for agricultural land), he grows corn, coffee and cacao.  The coffee and cacao make him the most income but they are annual whilst the corn is harvested every four months and this is the crop that gets him out of some tight spots with debts or daily expenses.  He started out in this business when he was very young.  At 20 years of age, he already had his own farmland.  Coffee is his specialty.  These days he grows coffee over one 'cuadra' because, at his age, he can't work so hard.  \"With each harvest, I get 5 sacks but with the cacao I can make more money\", he says.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ismael's second loan from MFP.  He pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loan.  He belongs to \"Los Kontonas de Palomar\" community bank.

She sells to customers who come to her house to buy, and she also goes around the local markets to make her sales.

Juana is a single woman principally working on her farm, land that she was able to get with great sacrifice over these last 25 years.  Now, thanks to the work that she does, she has her own land with coffee plants that are very productive.  Juana says that she also has problems in the rainy season since that is when destructive insects appear that hurt her crops, and she doesn't have the financial capacity to resolve these issues.  That is why she is asking for the loan that MFP offers to help with her business plans.  This will be her first loan with MFP, and she feels grateful for the trust given her.  She also thanks the communal bank for letting her work with them.

Norma lives with her family in a home in the district and province of  Chanchamayo. Norma is a woman who likes field work. At 20 she learned to be independent, and with the help of her husband was able to grow and produce fruit in 3 blocks or parcels of land.\r\n\r\nThus, she grows coffee, bananas and avocados. Coffee is her flagship product, which gets more revenue, but it's an annual crop. Bananas give security to solve her need for high revenue each week. But avocados may be what some tastes prefer. \"Every time I harvest, I sell 10 to 12 crates, each selling for 12 soles,\" she says. Meanwhile, Julio works at a private company which generates a fixed monthly income. He feels happy to work, because thanks to his effort he can support and educate their children. One of Norma's short term goals is to acquire another plot of land to expand her production of coffee. \r\n\r\nThis would be the first time that Norma would agree to a loan from MFP.

In spite of his age, F\u00e9lix works in order to provide for his family because he cares for his daughter Liz who is a single mother.  His main business activity is farming and he mainly grows carrots, cauliflower, corn and potatoes.  He gives his plants a lot of care and attention.  With 40 years experience, F\u00e9lix was able to obtain his own home and his own farmland.  He feels lucky as he will have an inheritance to leave his children when he is no longer with them.  He tells us that he used to travel to the capital to sell his products but, as he no longer has the strength he used to have, he now only sells them in the town market.  This doesn't affect him much as he also has 7 dairy cows which provide him with 70 liters of fresh milk which he sells to a middleman who then sells it to the factories.  In this way, he is able to make more profits.  F\u00e9lix would like to open a stable business so that he can live peacefully together with his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix is a member of the \"Chamblachaca\" community bank and this is his 18th loan from MFP.

She has two children, ages 18 and 9.  Martha and her family live in their own house in the community of Puente Kimiri, in the district of Chanchamayo.  Martha, a woman with a winning temper, has worked in agriculture for 20 years, since she joined her life to her husband.  Now she has experience in her job, so she grows pineapples on six \"cuadras\" [a \"cuadra\" is approximately 1.5 acres] and bananas on one.  The pineapples are a profitable business and her harvests are annual.\r\n\r\nCurrently she plans to grow coffee, so she needs to make the effort in the hard work that is pruning, irrigating, growing, weeding, and harvesting the coffee.  She also works as administrative staff in an educational institution, but admits that the farming is what she most likes to do.  With the help of her oldest son she is able to speed up her work and save on paying personnel, but when the work is more intense, for example during the harvest, she has to hire workers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her new coffee crop will be successful.  She will fight for this, as is proper.  This would be the first time that Martha would get a loan from MFP.  This is why she promises to be punctual in making her monthly payments.  Virgen del Carmen is the name of her recent communal bank.  She feels enthusiastic about being part of it.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money to buy 1000 coffee plants, each one of which costs 20 Peruvian cents.

Con los a\u00f1os y gracias a la buena ubicaci\u00f3n de su vivienda, que es un lugar tur\u00edstico muy visitado por turistas extranjeros y nacionales, ha conseguido adecuar su local como un restaurante, donde expende platos de comida tradicionales. \u201cLo que m\u00e1s sale son los caldos de gallina, en los desayunos; adem\u00e1s los chicharrones de zama\u00f1o y cupte (animales oriundos de la selva)\u201d, menciona. Sus precios var\u00edan desde 10 hasta 30 soles. Pero a\u00f1ade que, la gente mayormente consume alimentos de 12 a 20 soles. \nLas ventas no siempre son buenas, en los meses de enero y febrero disminuyen, pero se levantan a partir de marzo, especialmente en julio y diciembre.\nMilka esta contenta con su actividad, por que le gusta lo que hace. Su dedicaci\u00f3n para la preparaci\u00f3n de alimentos es el secreto para la aceptaci\u00f3n de sus clientes. Ahora espera remodelar su local para hacerlo m\u00e1s vistoso y llamativo. \u00c9ste ser\u00eda su primer pr\u00e9stamo que obtendr\u00eda de MFP, se siente emocionada de integrar el banco comunal \u201cVirgen del Carmen\u201d, donde todas son mujeres responsables, por lo tanto menciona ser puntual en los pagos de las cuotas mensuales.\nCon el dinero del cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 nuevos platos, m\u00e1s utensilios como cucharas, tenedores, ollas; adem\u00e1s de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus platos t\u00edpicos.\n\n\n","en":"Milka, who is 42 years old, is a single mother.  She has 4 children, but only lives with 3 of them, who are 20, 15, and 14 years old.  She and her children live in her own house in the town of Kimiri, in the district and province of Chanchamayo.  Milka is a happy and enthusiastic mother.  Ten years ago she began a small food business.  Over the years, thanks to the good location of her home, which is in a tourist location that is visited by many foreign and local tourists, she has managed to adapt the location into a restaurant, where she sells traditional food dishes.  \"What sells the most are the chicken broth at breakfast time as well as the cracklings of pork and guinea pig (native jungle animals)\", she says.  Her prices vary from 10 to 30 soles.  But she adds that the people mainly eat foods that cost 12 to 20 soles.\r\nThe sales are not always good.  In the months of January and February they lessen, but they go up starting in March, especially in July and December.\r\nMilka is happy with her work, because she likes what she does.  Her dedication to the preparation of the food is the secret for getting the acceptance of her customers.  Now she hopes to remodel her business in order to make it more bright and eye-catching.  This will be her first loan that she obtains from MFP.  She feels very excited about joining the communal bank \"Virgen del Carmen\", where all the women are responsible.  For that reason she mentions that she will be punctual with the payment of her monthly dues.\r\nWith the money from the loan, she will buy new plates, more utensils like spoons, forks, and pots, as well as ingredients for the preparation of her typical dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1003745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"buy

She dreams of seeing them become successful professionals. Three years ago she separated from her spouse and had to look for a source of income, in order to meet the basic needs of her family. This is why she started her business, which has managed to cover the household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has a small varieties shop where she sells school supplies. She also has clients to whom she distributes home products, like small electrical appliances and women's accessories. Her sales are primarily on a credit basis, while she pays for her merchandise in cash. \r\n\r\nAs her client base is gradually growing and Tedy can't respond to clients promptly, she is asking for a loan via Kiva - her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She is taking advantage of the time when students are admitted to school and will buy construction paper, notebooks, pencils, and pens. This is when sales of school supplies and paper products increase in general, so her investment will be successful. Furthermore, in her experience this is the time when the greatest increase in her sales usually occurs. \r\n\r\nTedy's greatest challenge is working capital, and for this reason she does her very best working every day, so that it will grow along with the help of a Kiva loan.

He maintains an entrepreneurial and persistent attitude faced with any eventuality.  He started working the land together with his parents and, now that he has his own family, he also works as a farmer.  Claudio owns four plots of land on which he grows coffee, cacao, corn and bananas, his priority being the coffee and cacao.

Farming work is tiring and it keeps him busy all year.\r\n\r\nClaudio is anxiously awaiting his corn harvests which begin in February and his coffee harvests which will be ready between March and July.  His sales are immediate.  He sells his crops in the wholesale market in Pichanaki.  He already knows who to trade with and how much to sell for.  His four years of experience have enabled him to identify serious buyers.  Claudio will expand his plantings, acquiring more plots of land within a year.  \r\n\r\nThis will be the second time that Claudio has received a loan thanks to the help of MFP.

Two of her children support her financially.  She lives in her own home, together with her husband, in the small rural village called 'San Pedrillo Lote 159', 30 minutes from Tambogrande district in Piura province, which is three hours from the city of Chiclayo.  As Maximina lives in a rural area, they still do not have access to the basic service of piped drinking water.  Right now, they only receive electricity.\r\n\r\nFrom Monday to Friday, Maximina sells beer, 'chicha de jora' (a traditional, corn-based drink) and food from her own home.  She works together with one of children. Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays are the days when they make the most sales and so they work from very early in the morning until very late at night.  They have regular customers because they take care to provide good customer service.\r\n\r\nMaximina believes that in order to continue growing in her business, it is necessary to replace her walls and repair the floor as they have deteriorated recently owing to the constant rain and they give a bad image of her business.  For this reason, she decided to request a loan for 2,000 soles from Edpyme Alternativa which she will use to buy building supplies and everything she needs to improve her home.  This investment will enable her to present a better image of her business and make more sales, which will enable her to achieve her goals.\r\n\r\nMaximina and her children have worked long and hard to set up their own business and, now that they have managed it, they are determined to continue growing together, uniting all the members of the family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1003846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to

She lives in a traditional family in Missira, in S\u00e9gou  town. As she did not go to school, she started as a retailer at a very young age, selling \"pagnes\" (African cloth) with her sister, who sold shoes and clothes. After learning the business from her sister for several years, Fatoumata began selling on her own. In addition to this business which she has had for 15 years and benefits from a lot of experience, she diversified her business by starting to buy and sell fish. Fish is highly prized in malian cooking and very well-liked. \n\nIn order to meet customer demand and to increase profits, Fatoumata is asking for a new loan. She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 24 months, with two fully repaid individual loans. This is her third individual loan which will be used to buy 1000 kg of fish powder. She obtains her supplies in Mopti. \nMadame Fatoumata sells for cash and on credit, on a retail basis, to customers who are mostly women. \n\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of 120,000 CFA francs. With this profit she will be able to repay the loan, and carry out other income-producing activities such as fattening animals. Her goal is to build a house.

This saves him having to pay for transport.\r\n\r\n\"Coffee is very profitable.  I sell each kilo for 8 soles in February and March, but there are months in which the price rises to 13 soles, in April and May\".\r\n\r\nH\u00e9ctor is happy with his production and his achievements.  Everything he obtains is the fruit of his efforts and shrewdness.  His sales are good.  One of his short-term goals is to buy a car so that he can travel and transport his produce.  It would be a very good investment.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second time that H\u00e9ctor has obtained a loan thanks to the help of MFP.  For this reason, he pledges to make his monthly repayments on time.  He says that he feels happy to belong to his community bank which is called 'Los Kontonas de Palomar'.  H\u00e9ctor will use his loan money to extend his coffee plantings, renewing or sowing new seedlings.  He will also pay staff who he will hire for this job."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire

The family live in their own home, in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Pedro is a farmer and has experience in this line of work.  With characteristic conviction, he carries out his work producing coffee, cacao and corn.  He started growing cacao three years ago and it is doing very well.  It is now the crop that makes him the most income.  \"From half a 'cuadra' (measurement of agricultural land) of cacao, I harvested 2,000 kilos.  I sell each kilo for 5 soles which I am happy with\", he says.\r\n\r\nCoffee is another product that gives Pedro a lot of satisfaction.  He cannot complain.  He sells all his harvested crops wisely in the city of Pichanaki.  He has to include in the price the transport service that he must pay for in order to haul his abundant harvest to the city.  Pedro has clear goals in mind.  Right now, he would like to expand his cacao plantings.  He will rent a plot of land a few minutes from his home for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second time that Pedro has taken out a loan from MFP.  He pledges to make his repayments on time as he did with his previous loan.

She has developed her work in sewing over the last four years. This is a business that she chose out of passion.

This time he needs a loan to buy zinc, since the water gets all over the house in the rainy season and this is very uncomfortable for his family. They have to move their household things from one side to the other so they don't get damaged.

the help of credits.  She previously sold children's shoes and changed her focus since then.  Because women's scarves are in high demand here, she decided to sell scarves and shawls for women.  As Mavluda says, her sales improved, and she started to earn a good income.  She travels for merchandise to Istaravshan twice per month.  Her husband is an electrician, and his income is quite sufficient for living, and they spend Mavluda's income on unexpected family expenses.
