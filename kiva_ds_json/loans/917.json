She is married to Nesty, her business partner, and a mother to her child. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNardalisa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Nardalisa earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Nardalisa is requesting a loan of PHP 8,000. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNardalisa dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Editha earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, Editha is requesting a loan of  PHP 15,000. She will utilize the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She began her business with very little merchandise and later, with what she had gained by working, she bought more.  That is how her business grew, bit by bit.\r\n\r\nShe is the mother of three children who are studying, so she is the sole worker in her business.  Recently, she has been able to locate herself in the front part of her house, where she has a bulletin board and places the fruit in boxes where she sells them and thus she is able to maintain them without ruining any.\r\n\r\nShe decided upon this type of business because of the rapid sales, since fruits and vegetables have a short time in which they are good and they go bad very quickly.  Also this business doesn't give the option of credit.  At her place of business, she sells onions, peppers, potatoes, sweet corm, all different fruits in season, and she works from 7 in the morning until 8 at night, though her day begins at 5am because she has to go out and buy her products first.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan in order to invest in her business and to buy the fruits and vegetables that are being offered.

Among the articles she offers are undergarments, jeans, and blouses. Up until now, Paola has not had any problems because her customers let her know their orders, and she takes care of them and delivers them. She hopes to receive a loan because she would like to invest in more clothing so she can have greater earnings. Her dream is to be able to have her own house and finish her university

She is separated from the father of her daughter.  She now lives in her parents' home with them and with her 8 year old daughter.\r\n\r\nHer business is a bookstore, and for this she rearranged her house and placed a glass case in it with all the items she sells.  In this way, she avoids the cost of renting another space.  Her bookstore has been in business for more than 5 months, in which time she has become well known and popular, relying on the support of her husband to do publicity in his free time.  In the mean time, she also sells wood, which she sends to the capital.  She thinks both businesses are a great advantage for the profits they give her, and she also has the means to give the best to her daughter and feels like a productive woman.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she feels thankful that they have placed their confidence in her.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 1,200 Soles, she will buy more bookstore items, of a variety of types, at a bulk sales price.

","en":"Fredy is 39 years old and is a man eager to get ahead. He enjoys working for the good of his six children, whom he has had during his 16 year common law marriage with his partner, Elvira. He lives on family land, where his siblings and their families also live, each in his\/her own house.\r\n\r\nFredy is very skilled at work and performs many jobs, but he mainly dedicates himself to the sale of juices he makes with tropical fruit. Everyday he goes to the city\u2019s main market to obtain the freshest fruits to make the juices that he then sells at a stall he has near his house. He has had this business for around 15 years and works at it every morning. He feels that his business is profitable because he generates a good income, thanks to the customers he has succeeded in attracting over the years. In addition, he sells fruits on the sidewalk in front of his house during the afternoons and there his partner helps him wait on customers. He has also had this business for 15 years, without any problem. As if that were not enough, he also works as a \u201cmototaxista\u201d (a driver of a three-wheeler van taxi) throughout the streets of the city. He has his own vehicle, which he uses not also as a means of transportation, but also as a source of work. He has been a taxi driver for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHis wish for the future is to establish a more comfortable and larger juice bar.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan from MFP and he is grateful to all those who have made it possible. He assures that he will continue being punctual in his payments, as he was with previous loans. With the sum requested, S\/. 1,000, he will buy sacks of fruit, mainly oranges and passion fruit and other ingredients such as \u201calgarrobina\u201d (black carob tree syrup), honey and bags of \u201ccancha dulce\u201d (sweet roasted corn kernels) in order to continue selling his delicious juices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1151553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase fruits and other ingredients that he uses to make his juices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T22:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T22:00:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":176.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.02,"local_amount":307.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":324.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456471,"comment":null},{"amount":65.33,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452134,"comment":null},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":169.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447307,"comment":null},{"amount":70.47,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053207,"comment":null},{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":183.11,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:15Z","rounded_local_amount":193.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T15:24:02Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454784,"name":"Pjeter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pjeter is in his mid-seventies, married and has seven grown-up children.

is Edna, 43, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Emelito, her business partner, and father to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEdna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Edna earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Edna is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEdna dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Comenta sentirse bien con su banco comunal, pues le gusta el trabajo que realzan apoyando a las personas.\nCon el monto solicitado, de 3000 nuevos soles, invertir\u00e1 en la compra de los ingredientes necesarios para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas; como arroz, az\u00facar, aceites y dem\u00e1s. ","en":"Emerita is 59 years old. She is a hardworking and tenacious. She is separated from the father of her 11 children, most of whom are independent. Now she lives alone with her three daughters and two of her grandchildren, in the house she bought with hard effort.\r\n\r\nHer activity is the sale of meals (breakfasts and lunches). To do this she has outfitted a space in her housing, where she sets up, every day, tables and chairs on behalf of her customers, and in addition she gives pension (contracting of meals) to the workers from the neighborhood businesses. She has been in this business for more than 8 years and with the help of her daughters she attends to her clients. She likes what she does, and has become known in her area for the good service and her dedication to work. On the other hand, what she doesn\u2019t like is when it rains too much and makes the going difficult, but it doesn\u2019t discourage her, therefore she has plans to continue and to finalize finishing the walls and the floor of her facility in order to provide more comfort to her dining guests.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan that she has through the MFP institution. She comments that she feels good about the communal bank, because she likes the work that they do helping people.\r\n\r\nWith the requested amount of 3,000 soles, she will invest in the purchase of the necessary ingredients in order to prepare her meals, such as rice, sugar, oils and more.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1149123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy the ingredients to prepare her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-04T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-03T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":327.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":322.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":359.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":373.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":371.89},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":401.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":416.09},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.63},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.96},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.11},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.77},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.5},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125.56,"local_amount":327.56,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":329.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456450,"comment":null},{"amount":123.63,"local_amount":322.49,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":324.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452111,"comment":null},{"amount":137.96,"local_amount":359.91,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":362.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447284,"comment":null},{"amount":143.11,"local_amount":373.34,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":375.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053185,"comment":null},{"amount":142.56,"local_amount":371.89,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188119,"comment":null},{"amount":153.77,"local_amount":401.13,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":403.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572029,"comment":null},{"amount":159.5,"local_amount":416.09,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":418.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121838,"comment":null},{"amount":163.91,"local_amount":427.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867743,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-29T19:57:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:20:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454675,"name":"Yosra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yosra is a very smart and active business owner who lives in Wihdat with her sons.

Maribel really likes what she does for a living, since she has time that she can devote to her family, and when she has large orders she also has the potential for large profits.  She has many plans in mind, but for now she just wants to formalize her business and start making it grow.  \r\n\r\nThis is Maribel\u2019s 12th loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the trust that has been given her so she can take out this loan.  She promises to make all of her payments on time, as she has done with her previous loans.  She is also happy to belong to her communal bank, since all of the members are very good and responsible.  \r\n\r\nMaribel will use the 3800 soles she has requested to purchase ingredients, supplies, and materials she needs to continue with her work; these include sugar, pans, food coloring, stands, baking cups, and other items."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":1151664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients and supplies for making cakes and other desserts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-05T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-04T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":563.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":605.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":620.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":645.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":669.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":695.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.97},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.88},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":446.07,"local_amount":1169.02,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456481,"comment":null},{"amount":236.88,"local_amount":620.78,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":624.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452144,"comment":null},{"amount":246.35,"local_amount":645.6,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":649.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447317,"comment":null},{"amount":255.49,"local_amount":669.57,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":673.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053217,"comment":null},{"amount":265.21,"local_amount":695.03,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":699.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188150,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-07T14:18:20Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454227,"name":"Felicita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felicita tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es una mujer emprendedora y muy trabajadora, siempre va en busca de nuevas y mejores oportunidades.

They all live in the house that her partner built, thanks to his effort and with the earnings from their respective jobs.\r\n\r\nFelicita wakes up very early every day to be at her small grocery store.  Her customers are principally her neighbors and they come to her store to buy all the necessary items to make their daily meals, such as bread, sugar, rice, bananas, vegetables, etc.  Her business is in her own house and it\u2019s the only grocery store in the neighborhood.  That is why her sales are so good and her earnings are always profitable and satisfactory.  She started 2 years ago and her husband helps her.  Before, she sold bottled water but that didn\u2019t work well and so she decided to set up the store that she has.  Besides that it\u2019s going well, she feels that it isn\u2019t enough so to her business  she added selling prepared food every night from outside her house.  Luckily this is also going well but the intense rains have resulted in the situation where sometimes she can\u2019t sell enough.  That is why she wants to build a small stand so she can set up a restaurant in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is loan number 14 with MFP.

Durante las ma\u00f1anas la actividad en su local es muy poco fluida, pero con el transcurrir de las horas y el incremento de la temperatura, por el fuerte sol de la zona en la que vive, hace que se acerquen a su establecimiento muchas personas en busca de alguna bebida refrescante. Trabaja al lado de su pareja, quien le ayuda en la atenci\u00f3n. Siente que le est\u00e1 yendo bien, ya que cuando empez\u00f3, hace 11 a\u00f1os vend\u00eda poco, porque solo se dedicaba a vender gaseosas, con el transcurrir del tiempo empez\u00f3 a vender otro tipo de bebidas y eso ahora le permite tener mejores ganancias.\n\nEste es su cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero 6 con MFP y est\u00e1 muy agradecida por el apoyo financiero que le est\u00e1n brindando para poder continuar con su trabajo. Adem\u00e1s se compromete, una vez m\u00e1s, a cumplir con el pago puntual de sus cuotas como en los otros cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo. Por otro lado, menciona que se siente muy c\u00f3moda trabajando en su banco comunal, ya que sus compa\u00f1eros son responsables y solidarios.\n\nCon el monto solicitado, 3000 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 40 cajas de cerveza, de distintas marcas, y 30 cajas de gaseosas, en diferentes presentaciones. Con el dinero que le reste comprar\u00e1 madera para arreglar las paredes de su local. ","en":"Merci is a good, friendly, and hardworking 41-year-old woman. She likes to constantly be busy, and is always working hard to achieve a better quality of life for her family. She lives in her own home, where she shares her life with 49-year-old Alcides, her partner and father of her four children: 23-year-old Gilma, 20-year-old Frank, 28-year-old Eloy, and 5-year-old Leydi.\r\n\r\nMerci's job is selling drinks in her small but well-stocked bar. Her business is in her home, where she has dedicated a space for serving her customers. During the mornings, the bar isn't very busy, but as the hours pass and the temperature increases due to the strong sun in the area where she lives, many people come to Merci's establishment in search of a refreshing drink. She works together with her partner, who helps to serve customers. Merci feels that her business is doing well, because when she started 11 years ago, she only sold soda and had lower sales. As time passed, she began to sell other kinds of drinks, which now allows her to earn more.\r\n\r\nThis is Merci's sixth loan with MFP, and she is very grateful for the financial support she has received that has allowed her to continue her work. She again promises that she will be able to promptly make her payments, as she has done with the other loans she has had. Merci also says that she feels very comfortable working with the community bank, because the people are caring and responsible.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of 3000 nuevos soles, Merci will buy 40 crates of different brands of beer, and 30 crates of different kinds of soda. With the rest of the money, she will buy wood to repair the walls of her small bar.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1151670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"to buy 40 crates of beer and 30 crates of soda, as well as to repair the walls of her small bar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-05T02:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-04T02:00:01Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":445.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":477.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":490.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":509.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":528.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":548.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.87},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.38},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":353.79,"local_amount":922.93,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":933.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456483,"comment":null},{"amount":187.87,"local_amount":490.09,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":495.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452146,"comment":null},{"amount":195.38,"local_amount":509.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":515.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447319,"comment":null},{"amount":202.63,"local_amount":528.61,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":534.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053219,"comment":null},{"amount":210.33,"local_amount":548.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":554.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188152,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-22T17:09:34Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454993,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria is 52 years old.

She lives with her children in her own house, which has basic utilities. Myriam has a business selling plastic products door-to-door. She began her business when she became single, because she had to find a source of income and raise her children.

With his partner of more than 8 years, Gina, he is the father of a 6-year-old son named Jefferson.\r\n\r\nHe is a prudent man and this characteristic has served him well in his work, because he believes that it\u2019s important to always be calm, and above all to have good judgment, in order to work as a moto-taxi driver (a taxi in a three-wheeled motorcar). He realizes that when a passenger enters his vehicle, they put both their lives and their security in his hands so that they arrive to their destination safe and sound. \r\n\r\nHe works in the afternoon, and the motorcar belongs to him; he was able to buy it with a lot of effort and much sacrifice. Before that he had to rent and he earned much less. He has been doing this work for 5 years, but eventually he also started working as a construction worker. He is currently involved in the construction of a school in the area, and he has had this position for 3 years. It\u2019s going very well for him; he has many people who hire him to transport them, giving him full hours, so he has better earnings. Now he is preparing to be able to increase his earnings and purchase one more motorcar, so he can rent it out and have an additional income. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, and he feels very content working with the group to which he belongs. He is comfortable with the loan adviser who directs his group, and he hopes to continue in the same way. In addition, he is committed, once again, to punctually paying off his installments as he has done for previous loans. \r\n\r\nWith the requested amount, 1000 nuevos soles, he will be able to repair some parts of his motorcar that, due to time and the poor condition of the roads, have begun to deteriorate. Another portion of the money will go toward paying for his new motorcar. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1151556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"to repair his moto-taxi and to pay for a portion of the price of another motorcar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-08-05T05:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-04T05:30:01Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":176.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":183.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.02,"local_amount":307.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":324.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456472,"comment":null},{"amount":65.33,"local_amount":163.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":172.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452135,"comment":null},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":169.85,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":179.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447308,"comment":null},{"amount":70.47,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":185.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053208,"comment":null},{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":183.11,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":193.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188141,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-08-05T08:13:32Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:53:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":454356,"name":"Belen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bel\u00e9n tiene 54 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy sencilla y amable, siempre hizo frente a las adversidades al lado de Walter, con quien ya tiene 33 a\u00f1os de convivencia.

She is a dynamic and very enthusiastic woman. She is married and has five children who are already adult. Currently, she lives in her own house along with two of her children and her husband.\r\n\r\nHer job consists of selling shoes and clothing. For this, she goes out to visit her friends, neighbors and relatives with the aim to sell to them some clothes or shoes. She's been doing this job for more than eight years and during this time she has learned many things that she uses to improve every day. When she is not working in the streets, she is dedicated to selling from her house since she has a glass case and a counter where she exhibits her merchandise. All of the items that she puts on sale are sent from another city by her husband who is in charge of selecting the best models to then send in large bags.

She is mother to three children of whom two are already adults and only Gabriela, 17, lives at her side and depends on her for her education. She has been a widow for a long time and since then has had to cope with all of the necessities of the home by herself.\r\n\r\nSince her husband passed away, she saw the need to keep earning income for her home to pay for basic expenses. In this way, she took control of the business which previously was managed by her husband. Now she is in charge of carrying on with a workshop (rectifying and repairing linear motors). She has been performing this work for 14 years. She manages four mechanics who are in charge of doing the heaviest work. She likes what she does a lot since she thinks she is a good manager and feels happy because she provides job opportunities to more people and this is gratifying.

She operates a small convenience store and works hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Jocelyn earns a profit by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them retail. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members and she earns a minimum of 500 PHP in daily sales. \r\n\r\nJocelyn is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income with her loan. Jocelyn hopes to grow her business and dreams of improving her family's future with all of her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

The Group Barrio Pincha-Chupaca, a group that now is initiating its fourth cycle, is characterized by its solidarity and hard workers. One of its members is Ms. Crecenciana, who is 54 years old, married with children who are older and a granddaughter. She began her business selling beer occasionally in the traditional festivals in her town. At the beginning she sold a little, but with the passing of time and seeing that her earnings were good, she pulled together a little capital to be able to sell more and grow her business. This way she bettered the quality of her life and that of her husband. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to purchase a tricycle to be able to carry to her clients (small stalls) the cases of beer. When they make orders today she has to carry them either by bringing little by little, or by renting a tricycle. \r\n\r\nShe and the other members of this group are completely grateful for the support that they have received through EDAPROSPO and the investors from KIVA.

Therefore, they will be able to generate additional income each harvesting season. \r\n\r\nIn regard to his purpose, Em decided to ask for a loan of KHR 2,500,000 through HKL to purchase farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides for spraying. He believes that this will allow him to make more revenue to satisfy their living needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1136821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides for spraying.

For more than 45 years she has worked raising pigs and cattle.  She learned this work from her husband, and they have worked together raising animals ever since they married.  Currently, she owns more than nine head of cattle and 13 pigs.  She is a person who works all day on the animal farm, raises the animals and then sells them on Wednesdays and Sundays at the city market near where she lives.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Ernestina buys the feed for the animals every week.  On Wednesdays she leaves home since it is a market day and there is transportation to and from her home, since on other days there are no vehicles.  She leaves at 5am in order to buy the feed and to return home by noon.  \r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting from the Campo Foundation is to purchase concentrated feed and a pair of quality hogs in order to improve the breed that she possesses, and to purchase cattle feed.

Martha is receiving another income that will help her to comply with the foundation and make more of a profit.

She and her husband have two young children who help them to work in the field, since for them coffee is the family business. The coffee that Maria Antonia produces is conventional but she would like to change to organic coffee production. This process will take a minimum of three years because she has to make changes to some of her plants and wait for them to begin to produce. She also needs advice from the Union Regional de Huatusco so that the process will be done in the best way possible. In order to get started, she needs a loan so that she can restore part of her farm and plant seedlings, as well as preparing the land and weeding. In five years or so, she hopes to be producing a total of 10 tons which will improve her income considerably and give her family a better lifestyle.

In addition to growing coffee, Alfonso does seasonal work in Mexico City as a bricklayer, since there are times when there is not much to do on the plantation and he takes advantage of this to do something else.

If everything goes according to plan, he hopes to increase production to 13 tons within 3 years, which will increase his family\u2019s income.

This will increase the taxi's capacity to work extra hours and will enable Rasim to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1155941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To paint and purchase a new engine for his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-08-06T11:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-09-05T11:00:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rasim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86.56},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.08},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.4},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.98},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.56},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.2},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.94},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.71},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.51},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.35},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":456221,"name":"Benita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benita is 47 years old from Tinago, Dauis, Bohol.

She is a hard working, earnest and determined woman with many desires to get ahead. For 18 years, she has lived with Carlos who works as a taxi driver. A result of this union are five children who are 18,16, 9, 7, and two years old. She lives alongside all of her family in her own house, which she owns as a result of much work and years of saving.\r\n\r\nShe has installed a shop in a small space in her house six months ago where she offers all types of basic products like rice, sugar, bread, milk, eggs, and other useful accessories. She attends it only during the day and has seen that the profitability of this business is very gratifying since it has served her to pay many expenses that before created stress. She likes this business since it requires no effort and she works peacefully in the comfort of her house. Additionally, it allows her to have certain free time that she dedicates to performing the work that her family demands and tending to her children. She is obtaining very good earnings and this encourages her to keep going since now she wants to expand her shop and stock it with hardware products and articles, as one more option for purchase for her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP. It is going well in her group since all are responsible and when there is any difficulty they always find a solution.
