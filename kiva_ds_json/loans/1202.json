","en":"Nigora is a young, attractive, energetic and cheerful woman of 41. She is married and a mother to three children. Their family gets along well. Nigora's husband works as a foreman. It is his primary income but his work is seasonal and in the summertime Usmon's work doubles. Nigora's children are already grown up.\r\n\r\nNigora herself has been working in retail for more than eight years. She and Usmon leave for work in the morning and by evening come home tired, but their children try to help in everything, and their parents are happy in this. Nigora loves to socialize and has a large circle of friends. Despite her employment, Nigora works to devote her precious time to her nearest and dearest. These personality traits support Nigora in her vital activities. \r\n\r\nAt first, Nigora had a little shop where she sold household goods, but after a few years she broadened her inventory. At the present moment she sells furniture. On hot summer days, when our tasty fruits ripen - watermelon, cantaloupe, various types of grapes, peaches - the wedding functions begin. And a summer table increases the beauty of a wedding function even more. Due to this, Nigora needs to diversify her goods, as the primary gift for newlyweds is furniture. Nigora wants to fill out her selection of merchandise, and needs to purchase more diverse and interesting furniture. For this she requires monetary resources, due to which she has turned to Arvand requesting a loan to purchase furniture. She hopes for your support and conveys her thanks to Kiva and Arvand.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":464.34,"image":{"id":1411745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

With this goal, Inoyat has applied to Arvand for a loan to buy children\u2019s school clothing for later resale.

He didn\u2019t attend school, because during his childhood there wasn\u2019t much access to schooling in the country. Another reason he wasn\u2019t able to study was that his family was large (8 siblings), with scant economic resources and they had to help their father with the farming in order to have food to eat daily. Eriberto is married and his spouse works selling tamales. Their children have already moved away and have their own families. His household is currently made up of his wife and him.\r\n\r\nBefore he raised grew staple crops (corn, beans and sorghum).  For the past 15 years, besides growing, he also buys and sells those staple foods on market days in town, looking to get a better profit margin than he gets by just cultivating his parcel of land. He also has a pig nursery. His wife, and occasionally one of his children, help him in these jobs.\r\n\r\nHe needs to buy 4 silos to store the staples and be able to sell them when they are at a better price.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This, in turn, led her to start her own workshop. She needs the loan to buy more wool from the wholesale shops in the town of El Alto. After making the plaids, she will sell them from her stall. The income Flora derives from this business goes towards paying for household expenses, as she is single with two children.

Comprised of nine members, it is directed by a board, with Karina as president. The members have different businesses, such as: selling mobile phones, selling beds, selling fruit, making plaids, selling food, selling potatoes, and selling fried chicken. This loan will thus benefit a group of small entrepreneurs. Karina has worked with the field partner for six years. She discovered it through a neighbour who is also a member, and who invited her and told her about the work of Pro Mujer. She owns a sewing and clothes-selling business, which she started several years ago. She learned the trade at a technical school and has been practicing it since she graduated.

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour, are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping their inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. In the future, Sabina plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.

But later she realized that the most profitable business was selling products already made so she changed jobs. She began buying raw materials to send to tailors to cut and embroider, shorts and sweatshirts which are products offered in stores and by distributors. She has managed to generate resources to support her husband with household expenses. \r\n\r\nDoris is an enterprising, active and tenacious woman. She was motivated to request a loan as an aid to continue with her work.

Now his customers demand gentlemen's clothes also, so he decided to increase the stock in his shop. His shop is situated near his house in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. One of his sons helps him with selling clothes. He has allotted this shop to his son. He wants that his son will devote his full time in the shop so that his business could progress by day and night. \r\n\r\nManzoor belongs to the middle standard family; he could not provide a better education to his children. Some of his children got educated through matriculation and now they are working. He had been facing a tough time due to the single source of income. Now his children are earning a sufficient amount to run a house. All of his sons contribute to household expenses. \r\n\r\nManzoor requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that he could buy gentlemen\u2019s clothes to sell. Manzoor seems happy after taking this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1418586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy gentlemen's clothes to sell.

Bayaraa, 37 years old, lives with his wife and two children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family resides in a Mongolian traditional ger (a portable felt dwelling) on a plot of land. He, together with his wife, has been doing house interior decoration on contract with entities or individuals since 2007 and accumulated a vast amount of experience. This summer he began building a house in preparation for the incoming winter and completed 60% of the construction work. Due to lack of cash, he couldn't complete the house. So, he is requesting a loan of 2,500,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as bricks, concrete, planks, windows and hardwood floors. Living in the house is better than living in a ger in various ways such as comfort and warmth. The family will burn less coal for heating as they move to live in the house. Coal is the main source of air pollution in Mongolia and reduction in usage will be sure to contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

She was able to open a small food store in her home where she passed the time every day.  With the help of the loans she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she has been able to improve.  At first she began selling groceries, but now she also sells meat, fish, bazaar products, and stationery.  In addition, she offers frozen treats in order to earn extra income.  Gladys works every day from 6:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M.  Her son helps out whenever he can, but she is the one who is always at the business.  Gladys has been managing her store for three years and it allows her to move forward without having to depend on anyone.  \r\n\r\nHer loan will be used to buy more groceries to provide more stock for her store.  Gladys has been with the Communal Bank from the beginning and currently serves as its president.

He lives with his wife in their own house, which is made of wood, since his children are adults and independent. He is a well known farmer in his area, thanks to the years of experience that he has in this work and because he is a neighbor. He came to his present town as a very small boy along with his family. They bought the agricultural land that he now posesses. With the passing of the years, the economic situation improved and allowed the farmers to increase their plantings of cacao, thanks to the increase in the price that the buyers in his area usually pay.\r\n\r\nNow he also raises barbasco, string beans, and fruit trees such as bananas and coconuts. By locating his plots of land in warm zones, he can achieve a good production of cacao; nevertheless, to obtain a good quality of his fruits he has to clean the weeds from among his plantings and fertilize his soil with organic compost. On more than one occasion, he hires local workers so that they can help him finish his work.

His father was the one who taught him, since this was the only way that they had to survive. To reach the land where he grows his crops, he has to walk 3 kilometers. He works there from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is applying for is to buy compost, herbicides and pesticides to develop his corn crop.\r\n\r\nHis dreams are to set up a stand to sell basic foods in the place where he lives, and that his children resume their schooling, because they only studied through ninth grade, so that they can get better, stable work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, he comments that with the earnings that he gets from his harvest, he will acquire a milk cow to take advantage of the feed that remains after the corn harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1421019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy compost, herbicides and pesticides to develop his corn crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ciudad El Triunfo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2013-08-31T23:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-30T23:20:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Livido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-10T03:19:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600264,"name":"Mahmadnabi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0431\u0438 47 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f -

Currently his children are grown.  Sharif's oldest son is abroad in the Russian Federation.  He left there for work because, according to the traditions of our country, the oldest son in the family must help his parents.  Sharif's wife is a very kind woman, caring mother and wife.  She works as a farmer in a field.  Despite the fact that Inobat practically does not have time for the household work, she, as a real rural woman, tries to take care of everything.  And her husband Sharif and children and all of the relatives are happy with her.  In order to provide for family's living, Sharif has been involved in his own business for a long time.  He fattens up small livestock.  Sharif started his business with a small turnover and a small quantity of livestock.  Because he liked this business and seeing that it was profitable, he decided to increase livestock quantities and expand his business.  However, he does not have enough money.  This is why Sharif came to Arvand and wishes to obtain a loan to buy livestock.  Sharif hopes very much to have positive results and will justify the trust given to him, and promises to be a responsible client."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1415301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T00:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T00:10:15Z","loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2449.36},{"due_date":"2014-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2532.39},{"due_date":"2014-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2618.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":515.65},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.14},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T20:40:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600679,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is a married woman with four children, three in school and one who is still too young for school.

They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

This form of work allows her to generate resources to support her family as much as possible, since she is married and has a son.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the loan area and the medical care.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1560.98,"image":{"id":1421041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy ribbon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T01:00:02Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adolfo Vicente\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora Madelen\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariel Ines\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dajhane Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22768,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2585.36},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2655.08},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2727.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2801.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2877.96},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2956.08},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3037.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3126.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.72},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":384.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":395.34},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":406.09},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":417.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.45},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":453.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":759.55,"local_amount":5240.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T11:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5248.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420153693,"comment":null},{"amount":395.34,"local_amount":2727.6,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2731.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429615265,"comment":null},{"amount":406.09,"local_amount":2801.8,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2805.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439736205,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-09-30T18:24:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600691,"name":"Jeremiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeremiah is 38 years old, married, and a father of three children.

For a period of six years now, Deogratias has been running a grocery business selling beers, waters and spirits. He has added another business, a retail shop selling more consumable and small durable items. He is really working hard and employs a few helpers in both businesses. Deogratias's businesses run from 7 a.m.  to 11 p.m. daily, and he is able to make a good return each month. \r\n\r\nThis is Deogratias's fourth loan request from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans to restock his grocery items, repair his grocery toilet and start his retail shop business. Deogratias's business profit, reinvested back into the business, covered home and school expenses. He will use this loan to buy more drink inventory and to put tiles in his grocery toilet.

In this business, he earns a net income of PHP 5,000 per day.  \r\n\r\nRodolfo wants to improve their business so he has requested a loan from those generous lenders which amounts to PHP 35,000 to purchase LPG tanks to sell. He's hoping that his requested loan will be granted so that his business will continue to grow.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As the existing income is not enough to cover everyday costs, Artur decided to start his own business and sought credit among local financial institutions but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Start-Up program, a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor people and those who are inexperienced to get a loan to start or re-start businesses. Artur's application was approved under the framework of this program for a loan of $2000. With the credit, he will purchase a car and will serve local people as a taxi driver. This will enable him to increase his family's income. With the support of the Start-Up program, Artur will get the opportunity to be involved in his own business and to tackle his family's financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n.\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1419118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase a car and serve local people as a taxi driver","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Bolnisi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-09-01T02:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-10-01T02:30:01Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":103.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":117.99},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":122.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":126.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":132.61},{"due_date":"2014-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":132.8},{"due_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":136.74},{"due_date":"2014-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":139.21},{"due_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":143.09},{"due_date":"2014-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92},{"due_date":"2014-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2014-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":153.18},{"due_date":"2014-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":156.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.07},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.69},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.64},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.61},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.8},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.74},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.21},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.09},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.92},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.18},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":600723,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel is 28 years old and runs a kiosk in front of her house.

Now the marriage season is going on and they are very busy continually knitting bridal dresses to support their family. \r\n\r\nDue to demand they are facing a shortage of material and are unable to knit fine embroidery. Therefore, Khalida requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she could eliminate the shortage of embroidery material. Through this amount she will buy stocks of threads, fancy cloths, sequins, and pearls of various colors.  Khalida hopes that one day her daughters will be knitting their own bridal dresses for their own marriage ceremony.\r\nKhalida is very thankful to the Kiva and its field partner BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.53,"image":{"id":1419117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To

He always has high quality products, which are sold to local retailers for a good price. As the family has only a seasonal income, Malkhaz decided to start his own business and seek credit among local financial institutions, but his attempts were unsuccessful because of his poor living conditions. The startup program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. His application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 600 GEL. With the received credit, he is going to purchase fertilizer. Malkhaz has already built a greenhouse and as he will purchase fertilizer he will be able to grow different kinds of vegetables there.
