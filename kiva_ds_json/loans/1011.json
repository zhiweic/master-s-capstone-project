Together with her husband, she manages the household and runs the familiy business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Teresa runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked on a table or mat. Some special items are displayed in hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people buy their clothes used from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Ma. Teresa is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan to buy additional stock of used, yet high-quality, clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. So, she plans to add more pants and jeans, as well as used bags and footwear. If she can continue the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nMa. Teresa hopes to give her children a good future and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This group is also a place where she can draw strength and inspiration from studying the word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1248393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for additional stock of used-but-quality clothes needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T03:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T03:10:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Do\u00f1a Claudia, una de las integrantes, tiene 54 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Francisco desde hace 35 a\u00f1os y juntos han formado una familia con nueve hijos solo tres de ellos aun dependen de Do\u00f1a Claudia y Don Francisco. Do\u00f1a Claudia se dedica a la cr\u00eda y engorda de vacas lecheras, las compra desde peque\u00f1as las crece y engorda cuando ya est\u00e1n bien para que sean pre\u00f1adas por un buey macho hace que sus vacas sean pre\u00f1adas para que cuando nazca el becerro la vaca produzca leche, esta vez Do\u00f1a Claudia esta solicitando el cr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera y su alimento Do\u00f1a Claudia platica que desde hace 30 a\u00f1os inicio con la crianza de sus vacas y la inicio porque quer\u00eda apoyar con los gastos del hogar y la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.

El grupo esta muy contento y agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado y que para estas mujeres a sido de gran ayuda para mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestros clientes.","en":"The \u201cLas Mazahuas\u201d group has worked together for many years with the communal bank and comprises women who have always tried to give their families the best. Their group name was chosen because the mother tongue of many of the women is mazua. One of the members is Claudia, who is 54 and has been married to Francisco for 35 years. Together, they form a family with their 9 children, 3 of which still depend on Claudia and Francisco. Claudia breeds and fattens dairy cows: she buys them as calves, raises them and fattens them up; once they're ready for breeding, they mate with a bull; and when the calf is born, the cow will produce milk. This time Claudia is requesting a loan to buy a cow and cattle feed. Claudia says she started breeding cattle 30 years ago and she initiated this business in order to help out with the household expenses and the education of her children. Claudia comments, \"since I was little, I enjoyed watching the birth of calves\". Claudia's difficulties are many, like lack of cattle feed that she can't afford to buy in large quantities, and the income she loses when a cow gets sick and dies. Despite all of this, Claudia is enthusiastic and hard working and that's exactly why her goal is to own many dairy cows that will produce big quantities that she can sell to more people, and eventually make cheese with her cows' milk. All of Claudia's earnings would be put toward supporting her daughters who are currently students and who want to finish their professional studies. Each of her daughters has a different dream. The other members of the group also hope to succeed and that's why they're requesting this loan. The loan will be invested in their businesses: Raquel and Maribel will buy pigs for breeding; Nieves, Paula and Karina will buy sheep for breeding and selling; Esther will buy calves for breeding, fattening up and selling; Carmen will invest in her grocery store; Ariana will invest in jewelry; and Felisa will buy turkey for breeding and selling. The group is very happy with and grateful to the communal bank, which has been a big help in improving their quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6125,"image":{"id":1246725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a cow and cattle feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":227,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":79000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4937.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.82},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.82},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.81},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":382.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":19778.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068192,"comment":null},{"amount":1914.06,"local_amount":24687.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":24723.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284931,"comment":null},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":19750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":19778.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199218,"comment":null},{"amount":1148.44,"local_amount":14812.5,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":14834.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596013,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T23:39:10Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:04:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503403,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha, de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer buena y amable, es conviviente con su pareja llamado Nicanor con quien tiene 3 hijos, tiene una casa propia en donde comparte sus d\u00edas a lado de su pareja y sus hijos quienes son su raz\u00f3n de esfuerzo, trabajo y sacrificio.\nEl trabajo de Martha consiste en la venta de productos cosm\u00e9ticos y otras mercader\u00edas como ropa y zapatos, estos va de acuerdo a la temporada en que se encuentre.

When she began in this business, it didn't go very well because she was only waiting for customers to arrive at her house in search of her products.  This didn't work because she didn't sell the quantity that they wanted, but in time she learned that to have success in this type of work, she had to go out in search of customers and have convincing techniques in order to be able to sell sufficiently, to obtain good earnings and, above all, to maintain her position as their preferred vendor so that later on they would return to make new purchases from her.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes to continue working and to be successful in the future.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Gina hopes to expand her business and dreams to give her children a good and quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

people to gather up their strength and galvanize the resources they have on hand. Dilafruz is one such person who is trying to improve her living conditions and stimulate the economic situation of her family. She is married and has 3 children. Her husband earns a small salary that is not sufficient to provide for all the family's needs, so Dilafruz has decided to help him for the welfare of the family. To this end, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" that was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she earned a certificate. She now wants to start a business selling food items. She plans to use the income generated by this loan to provide her children with a good education and nutritious food. Dilafruz is seeking a loan of 2,000 Tajikistan Somoni to buy inventory to set up her new business. She is waiting for your kindness.

She is very known in the area because she makes the finest bread. \r\n\r\nThe good aroma that one can smell when the bread is fresh attracts many customers. She feels very pleased to see that people leave the place satisfied. \r\nEverything she sells is of top quality and at an affordable price. Moreover, the service is excellent.   \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a visionary woman eager to achieve a brighter future. She thinks that a start will allow her to fight, and with a fight she will be able to achieve a victory. She is currently looking for this fight and she wants to expand her business but she needs capital. That's why she is requesting a loan to INTEGRAL, so she can buy flour in bulk, butter, jelly, sugar, salt, trays, etc.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena is very responsible and has a very good credit record.

That's why she has worked in agriculture ever since she was young. She grows potatoes and corn in small quantities, since she only sows on a seasonal basis. She reports that the activity she likes the most is cattle raising. She owns three full-grown cows and four small calves who were born very recently. From them she extracts 10 liters of fresh milk, which she sells at 2 nuevos soles each liter. That way she already has a daily income for the household, and she also buys vitamins that she administers to the cows so that they will produce more milk. In addition, she grows alfalfa for feeding them, and she makes sure that it's good quality. Aside from that, her husband works as a bricklayer in house construction. From that work he obtains a considerable monthly income with which they pay for some household expenses. They can also save some money for their children. This is her third loan with MFP and she counts on the lenders' cooperation so that she can fulfill her plans. On the other hand, she pledges to make her repayments. Moreover, she enjoys being a part of her communal bank, because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\nNorma will invest the loan in the purchase of alfalfa seeds and

With limited career options due to cultural restrictions and domestic constraints, Awaz is one of the many Iraqi women who work from home, using her sewing skills to generate income and participate in meeting the financial needs of her family.\n\nAwaz has two years of experience with the small, home-based sewing and tailoring activity. She enjoys making custom order dresses and other fabric household items and would like to be able to offer a greater variety of services to her customers. To enhance the creativity in her work, she would like to buy an embroidery machine. To make her general work experience a little more enjoyable and create better quality results, she would like to replace her old sewing machine and add some small furniture items to her work area. To be able to make these purchases she is requesting a loan from Relief International - Microfinance Iraq.\n\nRelief International - Microfinance Iraq offers \"group loans\" for clients unable to provide a guarantor and thereby unable to apply for a loan as an individual.

For the past five years, Louis has been working hard to manage his small shop, where he does tailoring. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Louis has requested a loan of 2,500,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.

In addition to cutting, dressing, grooming, and styling his customers' hair, he also shaves his customers' hair. The barber shop also offers a nice place for social interaction.

As a group, the members collectively guarantee the loan. Groups consist of 3 to 5 clients, and each client is evaluated on his or her repayment capacity. All group members receive the same loan amount as the individual with the lowest repayment capacity in the group. \r\n\r\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

","en":" Zamira is a young woman, the mother of four children. She works as a kindergarten teacher. Her husband provides for the family by taking out private work assignments as a building contractor. Since their family is young, Zamira would like to improve their living condition and buy missing items of furniture. Her salary doesn\u2019t allow saving money for such major purchases.

In 2010, they come together to stand united for one another and form this group. They belong to a non-tribal community living here in Manipur state on the outskirts of Imphal East district located in the North Eastern part of India. \r\n\r\nThe woman pictured with raised hand is called Ngoubi and is the profile representative of the group. She is 20 years old and is mother to a two-year-old son. She still shares the same kitchen with her in-laws but did not get any financial support. Her husband, 22 years old, is a seasonal farmer. In the off season, usually, sand sieving is his way of earning income for the family.\r\n\r\n In order to supplement their income, Ngoubi started her line of weaving activities. She uses a handloom to weave. (A sample handloom can be seen in the picture behind the members.)\r\n \r\nWith her first loan, Ngoubi was able to increase her production as compared to before the loan. The cloth that she weaves includes bed covers, wrap-  around skirts, and cloth usable for towels and shawls. She supplies her products at the market at reasonable rates. She is happy that she is in good health to support the family income. With the profit that she earns, she usually puts aside some amount to deposit in the group savings on a weekly basis. In this way every time she gets a loan, she has been able to increase her production. She is happy that from her business earnings, she helped her husband purchase a new shovel and a filter bar for his sand-sieving activities. She has been saving most of her profits as well as her husband's income for a separate home very soon. She has been doing this weaving activity for the past 4 years now.\r\n\r\nNow she needs another loan to continue and do better with her business. She will buy materials required such as yarn of various colours and textures to weave wrap-around skirts, shawls, bed covers, etc. She also means to buy the finished products from other weavers to supply at the market for a profit.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too are making steady improvement like her with their respective income-generating activities. Most of the group members are engaged in retailing rice; some have a business of 'paan' shop, vegetable-selling and fuel retailer.\r\n\r\nThey literally thank all the lenders and wish life's best gifts to all the lenders and success in everything they do.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1249190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy stocks of yarns in different colours and textures for weaving and to buy finished products from other weavers to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T17:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T17:30:01Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ngoubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemnungshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nungshi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kumu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thambalnu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naobi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Memcha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-12-06T03:53:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504034,"name":"Shuhratjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shuhratjon is a very hard-working and industrious man.

All of them are happily married and have children of their own.

She is 31 years old and is a mother to two sons of 12 years and seven years old. Her husband, 37 years old, is a seasonal farmer by trade. In order to supplement the family income, in her previous business she used to sell jewellery by visiting house to house. Bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc. were some of the items she sold. Being a housewife, it was never easy for her to continue with this jewellery business.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan in 2010 and with her saved money, she started a clothes business. She sells ready-made garments--kids' wear, vests, socks, and face towels (locally woven). She did well with this business and at the same time she was able to lend a helping hand as is required of her as a mother. The second loan helped her to increase her store's stock of clothes to sell and also helped her to renovate her store by extending their porch into a store. She is happy that she is making progress in terms of her business which enhances her security for the future. Unlike what happened to herself and her husband, she wants to provide her children a good opportunity for their education.\r\n\r\nSandha now needs another loan for her business. She will use the loan to buy more kids' wear to sell. She will also buy kids' shoes to resell apart from the usual items that she has been selling. She has plans to expand her business and specialize in kids' products down the road.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too are making improvements like Sandha and needed loans for their respective income-generating activities. Sand sieving activities, piggery farming, and pottery are the primary activities of the group members.        \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1249210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more kids' wear such as shoes, shirts, pants, and vests to expand the range of products that she sells in her store.

Her husband is an army pensioner and now spends his time in poultry farming and raising ducks. In order to supplement the family income she started a business using her weaving expertise. She uses the handloom method of weaving.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she employed two weavers for weaving. She produces traditional wrap-arounds with a design called \u201cRani Phi,\u201d well known on the national market. It usually takes about 10 days to complete one wrap-around. Through the loan she actually produced 50 wrap-arounds to sell and earned a good profit. She helps her husband to buy poultry feeding requirements and supports her son in a tutorial class after the school hour. She is very happy with the progress she has made in her business. \r\n\r\nNow Ibecha needs another loan to continue her weaving activities. She will use the loan to buy more yarns of different qualities and colours to weave and increase the production of traditional tribal wrap-around skirts for her business. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the rest of the group members too needed the loan to upgrade their respective business undertakings. Sand sieving, jewellery business, weaving, and vegetable selling are the primary activities of the group members. As a group, the members meet every weekend for saving a fixed amount of INR 50 per member.

With support from her husband and her father-in-law, she\u2019s attained great progress raising pigs despite low, mid-year prices.  She\u2019s requesting this loan to buy feed for the pigs that are still in the growing stage.  The pig farm has grown and needs economic support to improve the conditions of the two most important assets in her farm: the breeding sows and a stud male and the pigs that she\u2019s fattening up and are about 3-months-old.\r\n\r\nLidia has been raising pigs for three years.  She has the pigpens, pigs and needs money to have enough to buy feed for 17 pigs she\u2019s raising.  She hopes to finish with this litter in May and repay her first loan installment and then get the money to invest in more feed because then the insemination and care starts.  She hopes the new cycle will produce 24 pigs to raise.\r\n\r\nThis loan will increase what\u2019s set aside because it\u2019s needed to cover the next two Development and Fattening-Up periods with which the expected number of fattened-up pigs for May, 2013, would be obtained.  The loan is projected to be repaid in two, semi-yearly payments, one in June and one in December.  According to the farm\u2019s needs, this projection will allow for capital at mid-year to start a new cycle of raising pigs and making the respective payments.  Feeding will be complemented also with growing corn and bananas on the farm to increase their weight at the end of the period.\r\n\r\nThis is a family business and it\u2019s grown considerably because it has two breeding sows to care for piglets from birth to sale; the entire production cycle is contained within the farm.  An investment in these animals has already been made to improve the birth and development of the piglets.  Birthing units were purchased and a sector of the pigsties was equipped increasing to three the zones for raising pigs.  This gave an important growth impulse to the business last year.  A pedigree stud pig was also purchased to breed with the sows thus guaranteeing production of good animals that if fed properly will develop well and this is the part of the business that lack of liquidity creates problems for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1248197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Sarapiqui, Heredia","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T18:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T18:10:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":238095.24},{"due_date":"2013-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":261904.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":488.1},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":536.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":511988.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410095018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-05T22:08:53Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T13:26:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504039,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 35 years old.

October, 27 years old, lives with her husband and mother in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. She works as an accountant for a local bank and her husband renders a taxi service. Her mother works at a company that sells cosmetics. She has been working for four consecutive years in the banking sector, moving from teller to accountant. As winter comes to Mongolia, their home and automobile are freezing, so they decided to build a garage next to their house. The garage will keep the car unfrozen and stop the house from losing its heat. The constantly frozen car has several disadvantages such as emitting harmful chemicals into atmosphere and using more natural gas to operate. She is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT loan to buy construction materials and hire builders. If the garage is built, it will benefit many things such as the family's wellbeing, house heating, automobile operation and most importantly the environment.

She lives with her 3 children in a house she acquired several years ago thanks to her effort. For the past 22 years she has worked in agriculture and livestock. However, due to poor climate she had losses during several years. This is why 12 years ago she decided to have an additional business. She started to sell firewood in her house. Her main tool is an electric saw which she uses to cut the large trunks that she buys in bulk. \r\n\r\nOnce cut, she sells the firewood o her neighbors of her zone, generating weekly incomes that allow her to provide for her family and can be reinvested in agriculture and livestock.

She is not married and lives in her parents' home.  There are 7 people in their family and they live together very happily.  As a child when Zuhro played with friends, she always pretended to be a designer or a hairdresser, having grown up she became a real and professional hairdresser.  Zuhro has a rich imagination and creates beautiful hairdos for weddings and also everyday and different fashionable haircuts.  Her mother advised her that her skill could bring her a large income.   Zuhro decided to start a business - provide hairdressing services and rent wedding dresses.  \r\n\r\nWith this goal she took a course \"Get Ahead\" organized by the National Association of Business Women of Tajikistan and earned a certificate.  Now she can start her own business and become successful in this sphere.  Her salon will be located near her home.  She plans to use her income to help her parents improve their living conditions and also purchase necessary things for herself.  She is asking for a loan of 2000 somoni to purchase wedding dresses in order to start her new business.  She awaits your kindness. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1248478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Originally from Colombia, Linda spent seven years in foster care before she joined her new family in the United States three years ago. Her adoptive mom, Carmen, already had seven children of her own before she decided to welcome Linda and her two sisters to the family. \r\n\r\nAs if adjusting to a new country, culture and family is not stressful enough to a teenager, Linda was diagnosed with a life threatening disease in 2011. She went through various treatments and lost her beautiful long hair.\r\n\r\nBecause she had to endure many long days in the hospital, her mother brought her jewelry-making materials to keep her busy. Linda always had a deep love for jewelry. She discovered her passion and talent during her stay in the hospital, resulting in the production of beautiful earrings, necklaces and bracelets. Her first sale took place from the hospital bed, when one of the nurses purchased earrings from her for his mother. From that point, Linda has grown her business without even noticing that she had started one. More nurses and doctors came by her bedside to purchase her designs and the word spread among family and friends.\r\n\r\nIn August 2012, the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted Linda\u2019s wish to meet and be mentored by her role model, Ivanka Trump, jewelry designer, model and business woman.

She\u2019s a widow and has seven children, but none live with her anymore.  She has a home of her own and lives with one of her granddaughters.  Rosa is a very hardworking and charismatic woman and has been making food at a food stall for more than 15 years.  The stall is in a good location because it\u2019s in an area where a school, a university, and an institution are located.  \u201cI sell breakfasts and lunches.  Each day I sell about 35 portions, each at 4 PEN.  Yes\u2019 it\u2019s profitable,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nShe also sells candies and carbonated soft drinks.\r\n\r\nAll of her effort is for her niece and for her children who are studying in a faraway town.  One of her main challenges has been to acquire merchandise to supply more customers, but she feels more comfortable with MFP\u2019s help.  Now this area will be more visited during the Christmas season, so she needs more help.  This will be her 10th loan through MFP and she feels grateful for so many years of trust.  She says that she will be on time with her monthly payments.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the 2,000 PEN in ingredients such as rice, sugar, cooking oils, meat, vegetables, and other things to prepare her dishes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1249610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T22:30:06Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":212.95},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":224.48},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":231.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":248.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":255.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":265.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":275.15},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":286.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.79},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.66},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.5},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.11},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":85.18,"local_amount":212.95,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":219.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331189010,"comment":null},{"amount":89.79,"local_amount":224.48,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":231.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572913,"comment":null},{"amount":92.66,"local_amount":231.64,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":239.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122563,"comment":null},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":248.75,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":256.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868390,"comment":null},{"amount":102.04,"local_amount":255.1,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":263.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577218,"comment":null},{"amount":106.11,"local_amount":265.29,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":273.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529458,"comment":null},{"amount":110.06,"local_amount":275.15,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":283.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974550,"comment":null},{"amount":114.66,"local_amount":286.64,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":295.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995970,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-18T11:26:49Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504077,"name":"Pascal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascal is 34 years old.

is 45 years old. She lives in the Abasha district of West Georgia with her husband, two children, daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law, who is provided with a retirement pension. <p>\r\n\r\nOn several occasions Manana has requested a loan from local financial institutions for an agricultural business start-up, but without any success. Her loan requests were always rejected because of her low income and her lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. Manana has a plot of land where she grows maize. She does all of the relevant agricultural work to ensure a good, quality harvest. The crops she harvests are sold locally. She also has a pig and a milk cow, whose milk is used in dairy products. <p>\r\n\r\nManana is now requesting a loan for her agricultural business. The loan program provides businesses with start-up funding to assist the country's rural poor, who do not have access to most credit products as they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan proceeds, Manana would like to purchase a tractor. Her husband and elder son would like to use the tractor to perform agricultural work on the lands of nearby farmers, mainly on tilling and sowing seasons, and will be paid by landlords. They will save any profits generated as a result of the tractor and will continue to cultivate their own land. She expects that the loan will significantly increase her family's income and will enable Manana to provide better living conditions for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":1249371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She became a widow several years ago and since then she has been working to give her three children a good education.  She has a wood framed house and sold food for many years because she had a good culinary touch, but it was a tough job so four years ago she decided to open a store where she could sell groceries and vegetables.  Her business is located in the district market, thanks to a municipal expansion plan which provided space for her and other merchants in the zone.\r\n\r\nShe works from early morning, getting constant support from her children whenever she needs to be absent.  The sale of fresh vegetables and cereal grains in bulk provide a good income that benefits the family finances.\r\n\r\nShe would like to have the capital she needs to buy vegetables, grains, and other groceries so that she will always have these items in stock.\r\n\r\nOne of her main long term objectives is to buy some farmland where she plans to work and use that income toward her children\u2019s education.  They will begin higher education in a few years.  This will be her fourth loan and has demonstrated to have a good record of payment.  She is always on time with her payments at the group meeting and praises the good work that the board members do. \r\n\r\nShe will use the 2,000 PEN to continue stocking her business with grains,

She lives with Aldo, her husband of eight years.  During this time they raised their little girl, Fiorela, in their own home.\r\n\r\nHer main income comes from growing potatoes, carrots, corn, and beans in her own fields.  She says she sells every harvest in the capital of the country, where she gets better income because the demand price is greater.  Sometimes, when she's washing the carrots in the river, the buyers themselves pick her crops to sell them because they look delicious and healthy.\r\n\r\nHer other income comes from raising cows.  She has six that give enough milk to make natural yogurt, an average of 100 liters per week.  She says her secret is taking care of the animals: she nourishes them with balanced feed and they have a visit from a specialist once a month.  \"I have to take care of them to get good results,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and she's happy because she found the help she needed so much to achieve her goals.  In addition, she's responsible in all her jobs, so she's committed to making her payments punctually.\r\n\r\nElizabeth will invest the requested money in buying organic fertilizer for her crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1249468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-12-05T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-04T23:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":221.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":227.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":235.29},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":248.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":251.67},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":264.08},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":271.78},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":280.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.8},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.43},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":88.53,"local_amount":221.32,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":228.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188996,"comment":null},{"amount":90.8,"local_amount":227.01,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":234.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572897,"comment":null},{"amount":94.12,"local_amount":235.29,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":242.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122548,"comment":null},{"amount":99.43,"local_amount":248.59,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":256.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355868377,"comment":null},{"amount":100.67,"local_amount":251.67,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":259.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364577208,"comment":null},{"amount":105.63,"local_amount":264.08,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":272.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529449,"comment":null},{"amount":108.86,"local_amount":272.14,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381974543,"comment":null},{"amount":111.96,"local_amount":279.9,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":288.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390995963,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-06T02:20:22Z","paid_date":"2013-08-19T09:52:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":504111,"name":"Barbara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barbara's group is made up of hard working women.

estudios superiores fuera de su ciudad. Luego de haber cumplido un ciclo intensivo a lo largo de su vida en el campo junto a su esposo, decidieron que ya era hora de soltar riendas a una actividad econ\u00f3mica distinta consistente en su tienda de abarrotes. Tiene el firme apoyo de su esposo, con quien comparte los distintos roles que requiere esta abnegada actividad logrando convertirla en un buen sustento para su econom\u00eda familiar. Resulta rentable a fin de cuentas debido a que la ubicaci\u00f3n de su negocio se halla cerca de la plaza principal de su comunidad abarcando a gran parte de las ventas.\nYa que estamos a puertas de ingresar a las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o los comercios en general de su localidad presentan un crecimiento en las ventas mensuales es por ello que desea contar con capital para la compra de diversos productos al por mayor como panteones, chocolates y otros v\u00edveres en general como sacos de arroz y az\u00facar.\nA futuro desea seguir trabajando con el mismo entusiasmo para adquirir una parcela adicional de cultivo para dejarla en calidad de alquiler a otros productores ya que el terreno de la zona es muy f\u00e9rtil en cuanto a productos agropecuarios. Con los 1,000 nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 panetones, chocolates y dem\u00e1s vivieres de primera necesidad para la campa\u00f1a de fin de a\u00f1o.\n\n","en":"Nancy, 57, lives in the city of Ayacucho. She is happily married to Papiasabilio, 59. They have just one daughter, Karina, who, now an adult, is undertaking higher education away from the city. After having worked hard throughout her life in the countryside, together with her husband, they decided that it was time to take up a different economic activity, consisting of their grocery store. She has the steady support of her husband, with whom she shares this demanding activity, managing to convert it into a good means of support for her family finances. It works out as profitable, as the location of her business is near the main square of her community, accounting for a large part of the sales. \r\n\r\nAs we are now about to enter in to the end of year celebrations, businesses in her area generally show a growth in monthly sales. It is because of this that she wishes to have capital to buy different products wholesale, like panetones, chocolates and other general groceries like bags of rice and sugar. \r\n\r\nIn the future she wishes to continue working with the same enthusiasm, to acquire an additional plot of land to let to other producers as the land in the area is very fertile for agriculture. With the 1000 PEN that she is applying for, she will buy panetones, chocolates and other staple groceries for the end of year season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1249632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

Dice que ella estudi\u00f3 hasta segundo a\u00f1o de secundaria porque sus padres no pudieron seguir apoy\u00e1ndola puesto que tiene m\u00e1s hermanos y los recursos no eran suficientes para seguir ayud\u00e1ndola a estudiar. Ella pertenece a un grupo llamado Granito de Arena y dice que le pusieron ese nombre al grupo porque un negocio se va haciendo de poco en poquito de granito en granito como dice ella. F\u00e9lix se dedica a la compra y venta de borregos desde hace mas de 5 a\u00f1os y en temporada decembrina se dedica a la venta de ropa como son pants, playeras, chamarras, gorros, guantes y bufandas para dama, caballero y ni\u00f1os desde hace dos a\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n se dedica en tiempo de lluvias a la siembra de ma\u00edz y de trigo con lo cual les dar\u00e1 de comer a sus animalitos.

Ella est\u00e1 muy contenta con su negocio porque dice que le va bien cuando es temporada de fr\u00edo porque s\u00ed vende casi toda la ropa que surte, ahorita esta pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para comprar mas variedad de ropa abrigadora y tambi\u00e9n quiere empezar a vender botas de felpa para el invierno que son econ\u00f3micas y que ya vio en M\u00e9xico para surtirlas. F\u00e9lix quiere seguir con el negocio todo el a\u00f1o y que sus clientas ya le han dicho que siga vendiendo ya que tiene buen gusto para escoger la ropa.

She has worked with VisionFund for four years to improve her business' condition and with her earnings, has improved her children's lives. She says that one of her children is sponsored and she likes that because she has received support and help on the part of World Vision. She says that she studied up to her second year of secondary school because her parents could not continue supporting her because she has many siblings and they did not have enough to continue supporting her studies. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to a group called Granito de Arena and says that they named it that because a business grows little by little from one grain of sand to the next. F\u00e9lix makes a living buying and selling lambs and has done so for more than five years. During December for the past two years she has been selling clothing including pants, t-shirts, ponchos, hats, gloves, and scarves for women, men and children. During the rainy season she also grows corn and wheat, which she feeds to her animals. She says that she is going to buy the clothing in Mexico City where they give the best prices and will be able to make a profit when she makes her sales. She says that she sells her clothing in her neighborhood and to people she knows around her community since she sells her clothing to them in installments and every 15 days she collects the money little by little. She is very happy with her business. She says that it is going well for her because during the cold weather she sells the clothing that she stocks up on. She is now requesting a loan to buy a greater variety of cold weather clothing and also whats to begin selling plush boots for the winter because they are inexpensive and has seen them in stock in Mexico City. F\u00e9liz wants to continue with her business all year since her customers have told her to continue selling because she knows how to pick out clothing. \r\n\r\nShe is married to Fernando who is a public transportation driver. They have three children--Estefany is in preparatory school, Fernanda is in high school and sponsored by World Vision and little Emili who is 3 years old. The loan will benefit her because she will be able to have an income source to give her children a better quality life.

She is from Zit\u00e1cuaro, a town full of history, which lies close to tourist destinations where people go to enjoy themselves or relax.  Arge, as she likes to be called, belongs to the Sol (Sun) group.  She says that it was her daughter-in-law who invited her to join the group as a means of obtaining better stock for her sweet stall.  She says that since her husband died she has been responsible for the household expenses and, although she lives alone, she has to pay for services such as water, electricity and gas, etc.  She says that she has 4 children but they are all married.  She adds \"my children can only help me a little because they also have their families to support. Their help does, however, help me to buy my medication and pay my utility bills\".\r\n\r\nAs she lives close to a high school, a kindergarten and a middle school, she set up her sweet stall outside her house just over a year ago, she says.  The children from these schools have become her customers as she also sells soft drinks and fruit juices.  This business allows her to help herself and to feel useful since, being visually impaired, she cannot go out and look for work or go out in the street alone.  She says that someone who is a great help to her is one of her daughters-in-law who helps her to stock up on sweets in local shops, where she finds low prices and can make some money.  She says that this is the second time that she has worked with VisionFund and that it has gone well. She does not feel weighed down by the repayments since she can use her earnings from selling sweets to pay off the loan and continue stocking her stall.  \r\n\r\nShe is now applying for another loan so that she can obtain supplies of sweets of different kinds and flavours and soft drinks.  Her goal is to expand her business and next year she wants to sell pencils, crayons, note books of different sizes, rubbers and pencil-sharpeners as a means of improving her quality of life.  The other members of the group are called Silvia, Martha, Griselda, Laura Ang\u00e9lica, Argelia, Susana, Karen Alejandra, Karen Alejandra and Estela.  They will use the loan to purchase supplies for a stationery shop, ingredients for the preparation of healthy creams to sell, supplies of ladies' underwear and ladies', men's and children's clothing for retail.   They will also invest in equipment for an internet caf\u00e9, and will buy in bulk soft drinks to stock up a warehouse and sell wholesale.

solicitudes para su cr\u00e9dito se les ocurri\u00f3 porque una de las integrantes se encontraba cortando estas flores.\nMatilde la representante del grupo platica que tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Cesar desde hace varios a\u00f1os juntos han formado una familia con tres ni\u00f1os de los cuales dos se encuentran estudiando. Esta vez Maty, como mejor la conocen, est\u00e1 solicitando cr\u00e9dito para comprar ingredientes para sus antojitos mexicanos como elotes, pan, pollo, longaniza que es con lo que frecuentemente se le termina m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido sus antojitos mexicanos que vende son  pambazos, elotes, esquites, maruchas, quesadillas, caf\u00e9, t\u00e9, sincronizadas, papas fritas y la actividad la inicio hace tres a\u00f1os y la inicio porque siempre cuando su familia quer\u00eda alg\u00fan antojito mexicano ten\u00edan que ir hasta el centro y fue como su familia la motivo para iniciar a vender estas delicias. Maty cuenta que le va muy bien en su actividad es por eso que  esta muy contenta por sus grandes beneficios que le ha tra\u00eddo a su familia, aunque su \u00fanica dificultad que presenta hasta el momento es la falta de un  local m\u00e1s grande en donde pueda vender sus productos bien ya que por el momento solo vende en su adentro de su casa y para ella si es molesto estar atendiendo en este espacio tan personal, tambi\u00e9n le hace falta una muy buena parrilla especial para hacer las papas fritas.

The group is from a very pretty community but transportation is scarce.  They chose the name of the group because on the day they were going to fill out their loan applications one of the members was cutting that kind of flower.\n\nMatilde is the group representative.  She\u2019s 27-years-old and married to Cesar for many years.  They have formed a family with three children two of which are attending school.  This time Maty, as she\u2019s better known, is asking for the loan to buy ingredients like corn, bread, chicken and sausage for her Mexican fast-food snacks; they are the ingredients that run out most quickly.  Some of the Mexican fast-food snacks she sells are: \u2018pambazos\u2019 [chorizo, potatoes, lettuce and string cheese dipped in a spicy guajillo pepper sauce and then grilled], \u2018elotes\u2019 [corn on the cob], \u2018esquites\u2019 [popped corn], \u2018maruchas\u2019 [instant noodle soup], \u2018quesadillas\u2019 [cheese-filled tortilla], coffee, tea, \u2018sincronizadas\u2019 [grilled ham and cheese sandwich], and fried potatoes.  She started the business three years ago and did so because whenever her family wanted a Mexican fast-food snack they\u2019d have to go downtown and this is how her family motivated her to start selling these delights.\n\nMaty relates that she does very well in her activity so she\u2019s very happy with the great benefits it\u2019s brought her family although the only difficulty she faces to date is the lack of a larger space in which to sell her products; for the moment, she sells from inside her house and for her it\u2019s a bother to tend to customers in such a personal space.  She also needs a good, special griddle for making the fried potatoes.  Her greatest dream, however, is that her children complete professional careers so they can be fulfilled and have a more stable life.\n\nThe other group members are Reyna who will invest in chickens, Laura who will invest in perfume sales and Luc\u00eda in the sale of plastic items for the home.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1246720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The group consists of eight women and two men who chose the group name themselves and arose because they used to belong to another group that was called \u201cGranada\u201d but for them separating from it was like starting anew which is why they called it \u201cRenovaci\u00f3n.\u201d\n\nThe group representative is Herlinda, 55, who\u2019s married to Salom\u00f3n.  They formed a family with children but as of now she no longer has any dependents.  Herlinda works raising and fattening up chicks for subsequent sale and on this occasion is requesting the loan from the institution to buy 50 chicks and 20 rabbits.  Herlinda relates that she started her activity 25 years ago.  She relates: \u201cI started my activity because I wanted to help my husband with household expenses and with my children\u2019s schooling because whenever my husband was without work I could sell one of my chickens and get through an economic tight spot; what I like best is raising the chickens and watch them when they are little and they move around together; my only difficulty to raise them is the lack of a good corral so that they won\u2019t be affected by the cold and get sick because when they get sick they can die and that implies a loss of profits.\u201d  Despite these difficulties, she does not become discouraged and her goal is still to have some good sheds to keep her chicks nice and warm to avoid illnesses.  \n\nThe other group members are Gregoria and Clara who will invest in their grocery stores, Rosario who will buy shoes to sell, Albina, \u00c1ngel and Benita who will buy sheep to raise and then sell, Carlos who will buy calves, Rafaela who will buy yarn and finally Carmen who will invest in pigs.  They make up the \u201cRenovaci\u00f3n\u201d group and are very responsible people who are very enthusiastic about reaching their dreams which is what has propelled them into starting their activities.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5825,"image":{"id":1246740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 50 chicks and 20 rabbits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Dolores Hidalgo, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-12-06T02:31:50Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-05T02:31:50Z","loan_amount":5825,"lender_count":197,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Rafaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"\u00c1ngel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9375},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":728.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1456.25,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":18810.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068174,"comment":null},{"amount":1456.25,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18810.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284912,"comment":null},{"amount":1456.25,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":18810.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199199,"comment":null},{"amount":1456.25,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":18810.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356595996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-16T01:11:27Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:03:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503369,"name":"Jorge Adalberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jorge, quiere invertir en la compra de un veh\u00edculo para trabajar con \u00e9l, pero tiene que repararlo en algunos apectos esteticos (tapizado), esta es su manera de trabajar haciendo negocio con veh\u00edculos en mal estado, los repara, los usa para el negocio  y los vende en buenas condiciones, a parte de tener el negocio de las sandias, El proposito de este pr\u00e9stamo es completar el valor del vehiculo y comprara algunos materiales que sean necesarios para arreglarlo.\nConsidera que su inversi\u00f3n con prestamos anteriores le han dado al negocio movimiento, ha estado negociando veh\u00edculos y vendiendo,en temporada de sandia las compra para comercializarlas, estos cr\u00e9ditos le permiten tener una fuente de empleo y de ingresos. \n","en":"Jorge wants to invest in the purchase of a vehicle to work on and repair some aesthetic aspects (upholstery), since this is how he works: buying vehicles in poor condition, repairing them, using them for another watermelon business and then selling them in good condition.

Since childhood, she has always loved to bake pies, and when she got married, her husband's family was ecstatic about the delicious cakes and pies that she could bake.\r\n\r\nHer mother-in-law suggested that she tries making some money baking and selling cakes and pies, especially since her husband is not yet in a position to support a family.  Muyassar and her husband really liked the idea, and this is how Muyassar decided to start her own business.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Muyassar has completed a course entitled \"Achieving Success\" organized by the Association of Business Women, and she has earned a certificate.  She can now start her business for good and become successful in this field.\r\n\r\nMuyassar will bake pastry items at home, and her husband will help her to sell them.  Muyassar plans to use her income to improve her living conditions and to create her own capital for her future children.  She is requesting a loan of 1,000 somoni to buy an oven to start her new business.

He is married and has young children. His family's living conditions are very difficult. \r\n\r\nKahramon began working in the fields at a very young age. Like all the other village residents, he also herded cattle. As an adult, he got married and again worked in animal husbandry and crop farming. He mainly grows wheat, corn, and other agricultural products. He has been doing this for more than 15 years now. His wife and sons help him run the business. Kahramon sells his harvest directly to local residents for lower prices than they can find at the bazaar. He refines wheat himself with a mill and he uses the flour to bake bread. He feeds the leftover refined wheat to his cattle. \r\n\r\nKahramon wants to improve the well-being of his family. In order to do this, he needs to purchase some electronics and new furniture, especially because the latter is old and falling apart. However, he does not earn enough to afford the new furniture. So, he is requesting a loan of 2000 som to purchase it. The furniture will make his home more cozy, bringing his family joy and happiness. He is placing his hopes on you!

","en":"Sadirbek is a 26-year-old married man with two young children. He is very hardworking and motivated, but his family's living conditions have been very difficult. \r\n\r\nAiming to improve his family's living conditions, Sadirbek began his own animal husbandry business five years ago. His caring wife helps him run the business. Year after year he continues to learn new aspects of business and to perfect his knowledge. \r\n\r\nSadirbek tries to use his earnings to improve his family's living conditions, but these earnings are not enough to purchase new furniture and certain modern electronics. His children are growing up and beginning to require more financial resources. For example, he should set up a room for his youngest son, but he needs furniture to do that. Hence, he turned to IMON International for a loan to purchase furniture. He promises to repay his loan on time. He is requesting 2500 som to purchase the furniture. Sadirbek and his young son are waiting on your kindness!

He was born in a village that has good farming conditions. He mainly grows wheat and barley. \r\n\r\nThis is Akram's second time getting a loan from our organization. A few years ago he took a loan from our organization to start his own animal husbandry business. His wife helped with the business and they made a good profit. \r\n\r\nThen, for a period of time, Akram went to Russia and his wife, Mashkhura, continued to run his business. She planted all the wheat and barley while also feeding the cattle. Akram did not find permanent work in Russia and, so, he returned to his homeland to work on his business. \r\n\r\nAt harvest time, Akram purchases cattle at the bazaar for low prices. Then, his wife feeds the cattle for a period of time before reselling them for higher prices. The profits from Akram's business enabled him to improve his farm. \r\n\r\nThis year Akram planted two hectares of barley, but due to bad weather, Akram did not have the kind of harvest he was expecting. Hence, he turned to our organization for a loan to purchase a plane ticket to Russia. His wife will stay behind and run the business. Akram is hoping for your charity! \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1249121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal
