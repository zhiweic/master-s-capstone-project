By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.

She has been in this business for 7 years, and she works 7 days a week. Leonia sells her products from home, by retail.  She has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more crates of beer and soda and jerrycans of local gin for the festive season.\r\n\r\nShe also generates additional income through selling piped water. The main business challenges for Leonia include thieves, defaulters and the rainy season.  Because she works in a muddy place, this hinders her customers from reaching out to her.  Her goals and aspirations for her business are to see her business grow big and to own a fully stocked pub and also to educate her children up to university level.\r\n\r\nLeonia lives in a home that she rents; she has access to electricity and to piped water.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and for methane production.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva

He works from home, providing video services, such as making videos, editing clips etc... Eduard has extensive experience working in several  TV studios. He has been in this business for 11 years. He has received positive reviews for his work, both from customers and from experts in the field.  His current net profit is 3,000 hryvnia.   Eduard receives a lot of orders, but he often has to turn down potential customers because he cannot make high-quality videos with the equipment he owns at the moment.  With the funds that he will receive from Kiva, Eduard is planning to purchase a professional Panasonic HDC-MDH-1 camcorder which he needs to make high-quality videos.  With this professional camcorder, Eduard will no longer lose good orders.  He will also bring additional income to his family and further develop his business.\r\n\r\n

She has a teenage daughter, who she raised all by herself. Vera lives in Ivano-Frankivsk. She is engaged in retail trade in perfumes, cosmetics and hygiene products. She has as many as three sales points around the city, six employees, and a separate warehouse for the goods. In the past, Vera worked as an English teacher. After her husband's passing she had to take over his business. Vera set relatively low prices for the whole range of products; her vending stalls are conveniently located throughout the city. She has been in this business for twenty years. Vera plans to invest the Kiva loan of 20 000 hryvnas in the purchase of perfumes. She would like to increase the assortment before the holidays. She will buy perfumes, eau-de-cologne,  hair dyes, etc. in order to meet the increasing demand before the New Year and Christmas holidays. Vera's goal is to finance her daughter's college education.\r\n\r\nNote: original text in

She learned to do this so that she could open her own business and generate an important income for her family. She has been doing this for six years in a space that she outfitted herself in her own home. Her first customers were her neighbours, family and close friends. They still go to her, and refer more clients her way every day. Now, her business' potential to grow has exceeded what she is able to do on her own; her clientele is growing every day, so Sandra's need for working capital is becoming more and more evident. The money that she currently has is not enough to meet her customer demand, especially now that the most important holiday season is coming up: December. For this reason, she has turned to a Kiva loan. This is her first loan with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan, she will purchase beauty products in order to stock up on the tools that she needs. This will allow her to offer a good service.

","en":"Rosa, 34, lives with her spouse and six-year-old son to the south of the city, where she works selling movies.  Also, for two years she has been offering a service from her own apartment renting washing machines to neighbors in her neighborhood and nearby.  With a frequency of daily sales and installments, she gets a profit margin of no less than 50%.\r\n\r\nShe started her enterprising idea when she bought her first DVD player.  With her friends and neighbors and a television set they would get together in her house and rent movies to watch.  This is how she asked her husband to put up the announcement of renting and selling movies, which has gone very well for her.  Later she added to her domestic clientele the service of renting washing machines, which she had known about through her mother's experience.  Her two businesses have allowed her to generate income, with which she has supported the well-being of her home.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first funding she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan she will buy two more washing machines, with which she will expand her potential for accessing the market and she will respond to her customers' demand, which often goes away unmet because her machines are busy in various areas of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nRosa has described herself as a person who likes to save.  This is why it was not difficult for her to get her first working capital and make her first investment in the entrepreneurship of her small business.\r\n\r\nToday she feels very satisfied and wants to continue the growth of her business.  For this reason she does her best in her daily work, because she is building her son's future and she wants him to have good educational possibilities, so he will have the potential to be successful in what he decides to undertake.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":941702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to buy two more washing machines to expand her access to market potential.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-12T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":730000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55119},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54702},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":55978},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57284},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":58621},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":59989},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":61389},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62821},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64287},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65787},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67322},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66701}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.2,"local_amount":55119,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":58078.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188789,"comment":null},{"amount":29.98,"local_amount":54702,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":57639.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324991,"comment":null},{"amount":30.67,"local_amount":55978,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":58983.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039054,"comment":null},{"amount":63.51,"local_amount":115905,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":122128.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651196,"comment":null},{"amount":32.87,"local_amount":59989,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63210.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100704,"comment":null},{"amount":41.93,"local_amount":76514,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":80622.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338326,"comment":null},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":89791,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":94612.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394910,"comment":null},{"amount":48.74,"local_amount":88959,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":93735.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774745,"comment":null},{"amount":72.9,"local_amount":133043,"processed_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":140187.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386734,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T14:31:34Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369524,"name":"Yeimy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yeimy de 19 a\u00f1os es una joven muy emprendedora,  que tiene un hijo en la edad de 1 a\u00f1o,  con el que sue\u00f1a ver crecer lleno de bienestar y con las mejores condiciones de vida, que ella en  su inagotable esfuerzo,  pueda ofrecerle.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEditha operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.

In search of an additional source of income for her family, she started her own animal husbandry and farming business five years ago, with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS).  Today, her farm has five heads of cattle, allowing her to earn about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from the sales of milk and dairy products.

Asuman started making jewelery and selling to those around her. When she learned that the municipality was going to open an art bazaar for women, she made an application. She was given a stand and began selling her wood paintings, the jewelry she made, and lingerie that she bought in Istanbul at the bazaar.  Later, she heard from a woman in the stand next to her about Maya and applied for an individual loan.  \r\n\r\nAsuman has been working in the bazaar for six years and with Maya for five years.

She will use the capital to buy jewelery and wood supplies and to buy a wider variety of lingerie products to increase her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to increase her profits.

is 22-years-old and lives in the town of Kamwenge in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Scovia has been working hard to manage her small business, which sells various kinds of clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Scovia has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale, and will help Scovia to generate greater profits and support her family. Scovia hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home. \r\n\r\nScovia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Scovia's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save and take good care of her family's hygiene and health.

Because of her perseverance and persistence, she currently owns 4 cows, 8 sheep, 8 goats and is earning around 7,000 KGS per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. The income from this business allowed Zinat to pay for her children's education and do small repairs in her house. In order to further develop her business, Zinat came to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 55,000 KGS to purchase sheep.  In the future Zinat wants to increase her property and expand her

In the photo she is standing in the front row, second from left to right, and wearing a shirt with red, white and calypso (aquamarine) horizontal stripes. She is active in retail trading, specifically selling fruits and vegetables at various open markets in her community. She also sells crafts from the village of Pomaire.\r\n\r\nShe started in the business at an early age as most of her family are merchants. She has a fruit and vegetable stand she runs jointly with her husband and a stand for clay handicrafts, which she acquires from a craftsman in Pomaire.\r\n\r\nShe works from Tuesday to Sunday at three different market fairs and soon expects to join a fourth market located in the center of town. At this time of year she is also involved in the town's Christmas market which is scheduled in the evenings.\r\n\r\nWith a credit loan to buy merchandise for her business, she will stock up on crafts for the Christmas season, mainly to sell manger scenes showing the Holy Family.

Uulkelsin is a teacher and spent four years working at a kindergarten.  Currently, being on a maternity leave, she is involved in animal husbandry and farming, which allows her to cover some of her family's expenses.  Thanks to Uulkelsin's persistent work, today her business contains two dairy cows and twenty sheep.  Uulkelsin also works on 1.44 hectares of land, where she grows beans, potatoes and multi-year herbs.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a heifer.  Uulkelsin plans to invest the profits into increasing her livestock headcount further and dreams of buying a car for the family in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":943234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Tuu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uulkelsin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125476,"comment":null},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10010.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975602,"comment":null},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072215,"comment":null},{"amount":537.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25026,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370776,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T07:10:41Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":369754,"name":"Margret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margret is a 30-year-old married woman with one child who is not in school.

Her shop is located in a neighborhood southwest of the city, where she lives with her husband and two children, ages 19 and 22.  She began this activity in 2002 with savings.  Between 2002 and 2006 she worked as a merchant and in 2006 bought her first computer and an elegant display cabinet, and business began to grow through reinvestments.  She now has five computers and three cabinets in a very organized, well-appointed shop of which she is very proud.  Her dream is to expand her business because in the future she would like to turn it into a large clothing store with a lot of variety.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is having enough working capital and responding to customer demand, especially in times when there is a lot of activity such as Christmas and New Year's eve.  This is why she has requested a Credikiva loan, her first one through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to use it to buy women's and children's clothing and cosmetic products, so she can fill customer orders.
