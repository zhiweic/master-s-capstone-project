A great example of this are our members who work every day to improve their financial situation and to provide for their families.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Nelis.  This is the second loan that she has requested through the community bank.  Nelis is 40 years old, married, and has three children from her marriage who are 20, 17 and 15 years old.  Her eldest son is studying and working, and her two younger children are attending high school in the city.  Nelis' husband works in a shoe factory.  They own their own home.\r\n\r\nNelis is a homemaker and, as she spends most of her time at home, she also farms and raises chickens and guinea pigs which she sells in her community.  She will invest her loan in buying chickens, guinea pigs and feed.\r\n\r\nNelis' dream is for her children to finish their studies and become professionals.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4625,"image":{"id":989492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy chickens, guinea pigs, and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Paute","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":4625,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Livia Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelis Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Edelmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hernan Bolivar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4620,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":385},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":385}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":770.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263319177,"comment":null},{"amount":770.84,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":770.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033907,"comment":null},{"amount":770.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645988,"comment":null},{"amount":1156.25,"local_amount":1155,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321069,"comment":null},{"amount":770.83,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208716,"comment":null},{"amount":385.42,"local_amount":385,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":385.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335104,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T20:47:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384854,"name":"Mohamed S.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo above is Mohamed, a 49-year-old secondary school teacher in the city of Makeni, located in northern Sierra Leone.

She lives together with her daughter Rosmery, who she cares for in her own home, in the village of Huasapuquio.  Victoria has been farming since she was very young.  This business allowed her to support her daughter through her own means as she doesn't have a husband.  In spite of the fact that she is now older and her daughter is independent, she continues working.  Her business is buying and selling fresh, good-quality cheese.  Every two weeks she travels to the country's capital city where she sells cheese to customers who are already familiar with her business.  In addition, she says that \"if strength is on her side\" she also sows corn, beans and potatoes, for her own consumption, in small vegetable gardens.  Victoria owns three cows and two calves that she provides with a lot of care as they provide her with the milk she needs to carry out her business.  However, as they don't produce milk constantly, she also buys cheese from third parties to fill her orders.\r\n\r\nThis is Victoria's sixth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can carry out her plans.

Pero hace 3 meses, abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a tienda de comestibles, donde vende frutas, leche y dem\u00e1s productos de primera necesidad.

She has been living with her husband, Lucio, for 12 years. They have four children, all minors, whom they are raising in their own home, located in the city of Pampas. Her principal work is agriculture: she plants potatoes and maca (an indigenous root crop) on their own land in the upper area of the city.  She sells her crops at harvest to a well known market in the area.\r\n\r\nThree months ago Elizabeth opened a small grocery store where she sells fruit, milk and other staples. Consequently she does not have the same energy as before to do extensive planting. In addition her husband works in a mine where he earns a fixed wage that enables him to support their small children. She works hard because she has to care for her children alone during the week since her husband only returns from working on the weekends when the family is reunited. \r\n\r\nThis is Elizabeth\u2019s first loan with MFP and she awaits your collaboration so that she can concretize her plans. She promises to make all her payments on time. As well, she is happy to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive.

She has four children ranging in age from 9 to 18. She lives with her husband and she's a very hardworking woman. She sells breakfasts and lunches in a place located in the wholesale square of the public market of Los Pl\u00e1tanos. She has been doing this for five years, although her experience dates back eight years. That's when she, along with her husband, began selling corncob rolls from her own home, with very little working capital. Through their hard work, perseverance and work discipline, they succeeded in expanding the business into a rented spot at the commercial aisle in the market. Everlides still wishes to have the business grow and to keep on improving her facilities, but her working capital is insufficient for achieving her goals. This is the reason why she turns to credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase supplies for food making, fix the kitchen counter and repair the fridge where she stores meat products.

","en":"The newest members of the group are Maria de Guadalupe, who plans to use the loan to purchase firewood, and Ubalda, who is going to purchase candies. The other members continue developing their activities. Ubalda is 77 years old and married. Her husband is sick and doesn't work. She has 13 children, eight boys and five girls, all of whom are grown up. Ubalda has a post selling candy and is requesting the loan to purchase lollipops, caramels, marzipan, gum and chocolates. She started her business 10 years ago because she wanted to do something and keep busy. Her business is important because it raises revenue so she can keep eating and investing. She enjoys selling candy because children appreciate it, and her sales post is known for its customer service. Ubalda is happy about the loan and plans to use it to purchase candies to expand her business. She uses her profits for sustenance and to reinvest in candies of different flavors. Her hopes and dreams are for everyone to stay in good health and for her children to lack nothing. The group members thank Kiva and partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the loans and say \"We are happy that you are supporting us with the loans to grow our businesses.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":987538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase lollipops, candies, gum, chocolates, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Cleofas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ubalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193962,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330332,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044347,"comment":null},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T19:09:45Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385069,"name":"Srei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srei is a pig-raiser as well as a Khmer traditional wine distiller, who has been living in the Baray district of Kompong Tom province.

is Ronald, 32, resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. He is married to Helen, a housewife and mother to their only child. Ronald, together with his wife, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRonald operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Ronald's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Ronald's regular customers are from the local community.

She is a joyful seller who is always able to get a smile out of her customers. She likes her job since she makes high profits from her sales. She has been doing this for 11 years. In the beginning, it was complicated since she had to learn how to keep the fish fresh and in the process she lost a large investment. However, with time she learned how to maintain them fresh and is doing much better. In the future, she hopes to have a refrigerator to keep her fish fresh and not have to worry about them rotting. This will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy in knowing that she will have financial support since she will have more confidence growing her business. She commits herself once more to make the monthly payments in a punctual manner because she does not want to disappoint her communal group.

He is single and lives in a large traditional family in M\u00e9dine, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso (third administrative district of the Republic of Mali).  Isma\u00ebl did not get the chance to progress in his studies, and about seven years ago, he learned how to get involved in the business of buying and selling flower pots and kitchen utensils.  He sells these items in a shop located in the new market of M\u00e9dine, in Sikasso.  His customers come from all socioeconomic groups.  He is a very popular seller, thanks to the quality of his products.  In order to better satisfy an ever-increasing number of customers, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about a year ago.  He was granted a loan which was properly repaid.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg.  Antonia earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operationing her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria dreams to be able to give all of her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.  She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In this place located at the edge of the Caribbean, Aroldo provides quality cleaning machines for hire, to housewives, so that they can do their chores faster and be more efficient with the household chores, because they sometimes work, and every day they have less time to do their household chores. He also takes advantage of special festive times to produce food products such as cakes, hayacas (typical Venezuelan Christmas tamales), fingers of cheese and other snacks, which will generate additional income. He started out as an entrepreneur 4 years ago, renting a machine by the hour, but his business gradually grew, became known in an area where there this kind of service didn't exist and easily prospered. Today he wants to continue expanding throughout the municipality. Currently, with his wife, he also sells fried food every evening and at the weekends on a corner of the neighborhood. Aroldo plans to buy 2 washings machines and also invest more in ingredients and raw materials for the preparation of cakes and hayacas, products that have an increased consumption in the year-end holidays, which is why they want to take advantage and earn a little more money than usual. This is the reason that he apraoches credikiva, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which he will make the aforementioned investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n .

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products.

She lives with Antonio, her husband, with whom she has six children.  They live with two of them, Katerine and Josimar, in their own home located in the Pampas area.  \r\n\r\nShe works every day without a break, getting up with the first rays of sun and returning home at dusk after a full day's work.  Her main activity is growing peas, olluco (a root vegetable), potatoes and cereals.  She grows these on her own fields, which are in the higher-altitude part of her area.\r\n\r\nIn all this time, thanks to her dedication and determination, she has been able to acquire a truck with which she transports her products to sell them in the country's capital city, in one of the most important markets.  She travels there once a week, where she also works buying and selling potatoes at wholesale, thereby earning some extra money.  As a country woman, she also sells animals which she raises and fattens to generate good earnings.\r\n\r\nNow she wants to save some money to purchase another truck, which will be new and improved.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she hopes for your collaboration so that she can make her plans a reality.  For her part, she promises to comply with her repayments.  She is also grateful to be part of her communal bank association, as all the members are responsible and supportive people.\r\n\r\nOn receiving your support, Flora will invest the requested money in the purchase of several sacks of natural fertilizers to apply to her potato and olluco crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":989585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

Little by little she has been able to acquire a refrigerator, her television set, and provide an education for her children. She values the trainings which are given because she learns a lot in them, as for example, how to provide an education for her children.

arraigados en la Costa Caribe colombiana , donde son  preparados y vendidos en las calles por vendedores ambulantes, entre ellos mujeres  con sus inconfundibles pregones, que gradualmente siendo apoyadas en cr\u00e9ditos y logrando el crecimiento de su negocio, tambi\u00e9n  consiguen  de clientes a tiendas de barrio y negocios estacionarias informales al pie de los supermercados o dentro de ellos.  Esta tradici\u00f3n pas\u00f3 a ser parte del quehacer diario de  Ana, de ascendencia y tradici\u00f3n palanquera,  quien aprendi\u00f3 de su madre y posteriormente  tom\u00f3 su mayor experiencia, ayudando a sus hermanas, que se dedicaron de manera independiente  a lo mismo una vez muri\u00f3 su progenitora. En la actualidad aunque aun trabajan en la casa paterna,  tienen familias independientes, trabajan unidas y  eso si cada una con sus propios clientes, para lograr el sostenimiento de sus hogares. Ana es una mujer emprendedora y se apoya en sus sobrinos para la producci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n de los bollos en 6 tiendas  y un restaurante, ella vende a cr\u00e9dito en las ma\u00f1anas y recupera su dinero en las horas desde la noche.

They are handmade with corn dough and wrapped in corn husks and cooked or boiled.  They are traditional and deeply rooted in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where they are prepared and sold on the street by street vendors.  Among them are women, with their unmistakable hawking, who are gradually being helped by loans and are achieving the growth of their businesses.  They also get customers from stores in the neighborhood and stationary informal businesses outside or inside supermarkets.\r\n\r\nThis tradition came to be part of the daily chores of Ana, who is of Palenque ancestry and tradition.  [Palenque is a Spanish Creole language.]  She learned it from her mother and later got her best experience helping her sisters, who worked in the same business independently once their mother died.  Currently, although they still work in the family home, they have their own families and work together, each one with her own customers, to support their households.\r\n\r\nAna is an enterprising woman who relies on her nephews for producing and distributing the rolls in six stores and one restaurant.  She sells on credit in the morning and collects her money in the evening.\r\n\r\nAna finished high school and took degree courses in computer science and industrial machine operation.  She dreams about being a professional nurse as well as about getting a quality university education for her children, so they can improve themselves and be very successful.  This is exactly the goal of her persistent work, from which she wants to realize all her potential growth in machine equipment and generating employees.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting a Kiva loan, the first financing she is getting from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy ingredients such as corn, husks for wrapping, and twine to tie up the products.\r\n\r\nHer success lies in being able to invest in larger quantities than normal, since she buys daily and this does not allow her to get the discounts characteristic of wholesale and cash purchases.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":988531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Many people that work in the sector are passers-by. Hugo has been linked to the loan programs of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 11 years, in which he has received 9 loans that have permitted him to modernize his assets, like the fryer, to cool the business with a large tent, to buy seating, and to invest in a larger volume of raw materials and to open up another point of sales in a busy location that his own son attends to. At present, he plans to access a kiva loan that he will invest in raw materials and supplies in order to stock the new point of sales. This investment will be successful, for he is achieving purchases in volumes that facilitate discounts and because it will take place in a period in which sales usually increase. This increase is due to the fact that there is money in the market as a result of bonuses and allowances given to the employees of businesses that move the economy. With his business Hugo has achieved the maintenance of his household consisting of his wife and his 5 children that today are in the age range of 26 to 33 years old.

Their names are Felipe, Ana Luisa, Andrea and Daniela.\r\nHer daughter Ana Luisa works at a drugstore and in the afternoons she goes to the neighboring areas to offer seasoned chicken.

Today, she operates a general boutique. She is 34 years-old, married and has four children whose ages are between four and ten. Three of them go to school. Rebecca has already received seven times the MFI HOPE DRC loans and fully repaid them.

In 1986, looking for a source of income for her family, Santalat started her own animal husbandry business.  Thanks to her hard work, her farming business, which was started with an initial capital of 15,000 som (KGS) currently brings close to 8,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products.  In order to further develop her business, Santalat has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).
