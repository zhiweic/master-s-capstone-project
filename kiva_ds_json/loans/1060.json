is 33 years old. He is married and lives with his wife and two children in a small village of Marneuli district. The family runs an agricultural business and has milk cows and calves. They produce cheese with the milk and sell it locally.\r\n\r\nThe main income for the family is his newly started grocery store, selling different types of groceries. It has been a profitable project, but also needs more support to further develop. Several times he has asked for loans from local financial institutions to develop his business, but without success. His loan requests were rejected each time because of their low income. \r\n\r\nFamil\u2019s loan request was approved as part of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides business start-ups and re-startups with credit with soft conditions to the rural poor who do not have access to credit products, since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit, Famil will cover the cost of purchasing needed stock of basic groceries that customers often request. He plans to increase the turnover in his business gradually. \r\n\r\nThe new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly increase the income of the family. Famil will work hard, and he will be able to improve living conditions for his family. With this loan, his family will generate enough income to access regular available credit products in the country\u2019s capital market, in the event that they need it and also Famil will renovate his house which is old and damaged.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1222.78,"image":{"id":1297479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He now works for a state-owned company where he has worked for a number of years, primarily building homes for people with low resources. \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a loan in order to pay for university coursework so that he is better prepared and up-to-date with industry technology. The coursework is very expensive and he cannot cover the cost with his salary alone. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550.56,"image":{"id":1297245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for university coursework.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-02-19T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-21T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lu\u00eds Azamat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":812.89},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1362.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1384.19},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1462.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1492.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1548.59},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1627.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1668.95},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1748.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1798.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1866.58},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1967.47},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2011.85},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2093.27},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2153.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.14},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.38},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.4},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":34.14,"local_amount":812.89,"processed_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":829.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364494052,"comment":null},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":1362.14,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1389.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115347,"comment":null},{"amount":58.14,"local_amount":1384.19,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1411.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675008,"comment":null},{"amount":61.44,"local_amount":1462.84,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1492.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539287,"comment":null},{"amount":62.66,"local_amount":1492.06,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788526,"comment":null},{"amount":65.04,"local_amount":1548.59,"processed_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1579.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410064860,"comment":null},{"amount":68.38,"local_amount":1627.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1660.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419828748,"comment":null},{"amount":70.09,"local_amount":1668.95,"processed_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1702.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384538,"comment":null},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":1748.85,"processed_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1783.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439978299,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-19T21:54:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529267,"name":"Otar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otar is 54 years old.

He has been a farmer since he was eight years old because his father always told him that he needed to learn.  He also learned to drive farming machinery, thanks to a friend he met when he was 14.  Now this is his source of income; operating heavy machinery.  When he has free time he and his friends go to the sea to fish so that there is no shortage of food in his home.  When he goes to farm he must walk for an hour to reach his farmland.\r\n\r\nHe will use the money from this loan, through Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, to rent 7,000 square meters of land, to buy half a sack of corn seed and three sacks of fertilizer.

He is a very hardworking man who, from a very young age, learned to earn his daily bread with the sweat of his own brow, since his parents had few economic resources and he had to support them.  Therefore, he was only able to study until the age of 16, although he would have liked to study Civil Engineering.  \n\nJulio works as a farm labourer every day and also has a plot of land on which he has sown tuna, a kind of cactus whose fruit is multi-coloured and very attractive.  Furthermore, his plants have become infested with mealy bugs, a type of insect which lives on these types of plants and from which a kind of natural dye is obtained.  \n\nJulio believes that he is achieving success with his business because he is responsible and, above all, because he likes what he does.  He is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, with the help that they provide, he can cover the costs of eradicating the mealy bugs, which involves buying special spatulas and brushes to collect them.  This will enable him to grow his crops in an appropriate way and have a better harvest, so he can boost his income and continue striving to realise his greatest ambition: \u201cto improve his quality of life\".

Luis could only study up to the fifth year of secondary school but he would have liked to study Business Administration. Due to limited economic resources he could not do so. \r\n\r\nEveryday Luis works in a grocery store, working about nine hours daily and attending to about ten customers daily. He believes that he is getting ahead in his work because he is very friendly with his clients and is responsible. \r\n\r\nLuis is very thankful for the support that is being brought to him through the Kiva lenders. Thanks to the help provided he will be able to pay for maintenance and repair to his moto-taxi.

earns an income by extracting palm oil and kennel oil and offering these for sale. Her business is located at the market at Asafora, near Cape Coast.  \r\n\r\nEsi is not married, so she uses her income to support herself. She pays all her living and accommodation bills on her own.  \r\n\r\nEsi will use her loan to purchase more palm fruit and palm kennel from which she will extract oil to offer for sale.

lives in the Eldoret area of Kenya, which is a training ground for many of Kenya's Olympic runners. She has five children and has been doing this work for 25 years.  Her primary income sources are milk and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Keeping dairy cows for milk production!' Her biggest challenge is 'loosing an animal due to illness\".The animal in the farm is named 'Murgusi.'\r\n\r\nVeronica was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'Knew about Juhudi from a daughter in the group.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'How to increase assets like dairy cows through getting financed by Juhudi.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees. When asked 'How will this loan benefit your family?', Veronica replied 'Purchase a cow; thus more milk production.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Veronica owns the following: 'cow' but does not own 'pig, poultry, pump, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile'. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs

takes care of her two elder sisters, one living in a nursing home, the other at home. \u201cMy heart goes out to them,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to do something to make them feel joy and comfort.\u201d\n\nWitnessing how her family, like so many others, struggles to find enough time to care for their immediate families and to care for their extended family members, Ramona saw a need for caregivers in her hometown of Gretna, Louisiana. Through her church, she initially began caring for others as a volunteer.\n\n\u201cI go to nursing homes and do a church service, and it makes them feel happy. I think I get more out of it than they do,\u201d she says. \u201cEventually, my turn will come and hopefully someone will be there for me.\u201d\n\nRamona later decided to go into business as a caregiver. \u201cI enjoy it,\u201d she says. \u201cOne day a week wasn\u2019t enough for me.\u201d She says the families of those she cares for don\u2019t neglect them, but simply have their own lives and limited time in every day. \u201cI can\u2019t explain the joy it gives me,\u201d she says. \n\nRamona, who recently turned 53, launched her business, Compassionate Angels, LLC, the last week of January 2012. It\u2019s a business she calls \u201ccompassion-ship\u201d for the elderly. \n\nA quick visit to the Louisiana Small Business Development Center inspired Ramona to inquire about a loan from Accion Texas Inc. Upon approval, she was able to purchase computer supplies and QuickBooks, an accounting software package for small businesses. \u201cIt kind of gives me the comfortable feeling that I have backup. For example, just in case a client hasn\u2019t paid yet, I can still continue their care without interruption.\u201d  \n\nAccion helped Ramona immensely and educated her with useful advice for future business needs, she says. She\u2019s taking her business day by day, but plans to hire another compassionate caregiver as she gains more clients. \n\nThrough her experience with the elders she cares for, Ramona says she\u2019s learned how time has changed family values, but also how to keep close family ties during times of a generation that rushes the day.

Only the youngest one is in school. The rest are working. She started her business after separating from the father of her children. She had to move from one region to a town in Chinandega in search of work. She needed to support her children, since she was a single mother with no support from anybody and due to her children, she was unable to find work. But with the help of a good samaritan who gathered corn and offered her this product on credit, she started her tortilla business. With time, she was able to start another small business - selling clothing as a street vendor. Now she has been in this business for 13 years. Even though she was not able to help her children with their professional studies, they finished secondary school and learned to work for themselves. This is not the first time she has asked for credit through our institution. She has an excellent credit record, because she has been very determined. This investment will help her have the necessary ingredients to make her tortillas and invest capital in her clothing sales business.

futuro a la Sierra ecuatoriana. Ahora vive con su pareja Iv\u00e1n de 34 a\u00f1os con quien tiene 2 hijos de 14 y 6 a\u00f1os, ambos estudian y tambi\u00e9n ayudan en las labores de la casa. Son una familia muy unida y viven en una parroquia rural de la ciudad de Quito capital de la provincia del Ecuador, su nombre es Nanegalito, parroquia ubicada al noroccidente de la Provincia de Pichincha, que fue residencia de una cultura ecuatoriana. Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas. Su punto fuerte en la producci\u00f3n es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos que hasta hace poco no era un beneficio que todos gozaban.\nDiana lleg\u00f3 a Nanegalito ayudando a su pareja en el campo, cultivando varios tipos de frutos y tambi\u00e9n cuidando animales para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n. Al ver la necesidad en su hogar, hace un a\u00f1o ella tambi\u00e9n decidi\u00f3 asumir el reto de criar cerdos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, aunque en una ocasi\u00f3n ya lo hab\u00eda intentado y no result\u00f3 como ella esperaba, no se ha dado por vencida.  Mejorando los criaderos y ocupando casi 10 horas al cuidado de los cerdos, Diana ha incrementado sus ingresos y ahora requiere un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un par de cerdos adicionales para criarlos y as\u00ed poder salir al mercado con m\u00e1s producto para cumplir con la demanda de los visitantes de la zona que siempre van en busca de lo mejor. Diana sue\u00f1a con tener junto a su familia un futuro prometedor, convertirse en una microempresaria reconocida, para lo cual est\u00e1 adquiriendo varias herramientas gracias a la asesor\u00eda de Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa  y su ejecutivo de cuenta, en donde encontr\u00f3 el apoyo y confianza para tener un capital a trav\u00e9s del producto Kiva en donde adem\u00e1s ella consigue que sus proyectos de vida sean apoyados en todo el mundo. ","en":"Diana is a 29 year old woman who was born in a a home in the Costa Region, and emigrated to the Ecuadorian Sierra when she was very young in search of a better future. Now she lives with her partner, 34-year-old Iv\u00e1n, with whom she has two children, ages 14 and 6. They both study and also help with house work. They are a very united family and they live in a rural parish in the city of Quito, capitol of the province of Ecuador. The name of the parish is Nanegalito, located northwest of the Pichincha Province, which was the home of an Ecuadorian culture.\r\n\r\nThis place possesses a variety of flora and fauna, and also has rivers and waterfalls. Its strong point in production is cattle, with the production of milk and meat, as well as agriculture, with the production of sugar cane stalks, yucca, corn, oranges, tangerines and papayas. Hand crafts are also a business opportunity in the area, in demand for their particular use of natural materials such as seeds from the forest. Due to all of this, the local authorities have made it a point to do appropriate installations so that all of their over 3,000 inhabitants have access to basic services, which up until recently were not a benefit that all were able to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhen Diana arrived to Nanegalito she was helping her partner in the field, sowing various types of fruits and also raising animals to be sold. Upon seeing the amount of need in her household, a year ago she decided to also take on the challenge of raising pigs to be sold, even though on one occasion she had already tried and it had not turned out the way she had hoped. She had not given up. Improving the nurseries and spending almost 10 hours taking care of the pigs, Diana has increased her income and now she needs a loan so she can buy a couple of additional pigs to raise and that way she can go to the market with more products to meet the demand of the area's visitors who always go in search of the best.\r\n\r\nDiana dreams of having a promising future along with her family and becoming a recognized micro entrepreneur. For this purpose she is acquiring several tools, thanks to the advice of Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa and its account executive. Via Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she found the support and trust to gain capital through the Kiva product, and this is where she also got her life's projects supported around the world."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1297160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pigs and supplies for raising them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Gisela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":747.04,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":58.79},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.05},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.6},{"due_date":"2013-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":68.28},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.02},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.16},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.29,"local_amount":50.09,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494983,"comment":null},{"amount":57.49,"local_amount":57.26,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":57.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524913,"comment":null},{"amount":59.02,"local_amount":58.79,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":59.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133217,"comment":null},{"amount":59.77,"local_amount":59.54,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313755,"comment":null},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":61.05,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565362,"comment":null},{"amount":62.16,"local_amount":61.92,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814403,"comment":null},{"amount":399.97,"local_amount":398.39,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":399.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320579,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T05:06:59Z","paid_date":"2013-10-18T08:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529495,"name":"4 De Marzo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de emprendimiento 4 DE MARZO est\u00e1  compuesto por ocho integrantes, todas  mujeres,  la presidenta del banco es la Sra.

This borrower has in the household 'mosquito net' but does not have 'electricity, solar power, running water, sewing machine, TV, DVD'.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down.\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1297632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3594.76},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3689.76},{"due_date":"2013-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3787.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3887.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3990.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4095.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4204.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4315.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4429.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4546.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4666.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4789.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.94},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.25,"local_amount":8891.65,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8957.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960340,"comment":null},{"amount":95.66,"local_amount":8318.37,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8379.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820019,"comment":null},{"amount":47.53,"local_amount":4133.25,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4163.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417136,"comment":null},{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":4332.51,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4364.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410980665,"comment":null},{"amount":50.11,"local_amount":4357.03,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4389.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880647,"comment":null},{"amount":229.63,"local_amount":19967.19,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20114.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529283,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T04:45:36Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T17:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529358,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer is a 37-year-old single parent with a child.

She started her own business with her husband in 1996.  Despite the struggles of life, she remains lively and cheerful.  She strongly believes in a bright future for her family.  In order to provide a source of income for her family, Kairiniza makes her living working with livestock.  She began her business with 10,000 KGS.  Thanks to perseverance and hard work, the business now brings in 7,000 KGS a month.  Kairiniza also cultivates two hectares of land each year, raising beans and perennial grasses.  With the goal of further developing her business, Kairiniza has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 KGS to buy two bulls.  She plans to use the profits from the loan to expand the amount of land she cultivates and to increase the number of cattle she owns.  She dreams that her children will have good jobs and good families in the future.

Es un lugar poseedor de diversidad de flora y fauna y adem\u00e1s r\u00edos y cascadas que son una fuente cristalina que atrae turistas nacionales y extranjeros, por los negocios que ofertan deportes extremos que a simple vista se puede ver que son manufacturados con mucha seguridad e ingenio. Otro medio de producci\u00f3n de la zona es la ganader\u00eda con la producci\u00f3n de leche y carne y tambi\u00e9n la agricultura con la producci\u00f3n de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, yuca, ca\u00f1a, ma\u00edz, naranjas, mandarinas y papayas. Las artesan\u00edas elaboradas a mano tambi\u00e9n son una oportunidad de negocio en el lugar, que son demandadas por el uso particular de materiales naturales como semillas del bosque. Por todo esto las autoridades locales se han preocupado por hacer instalaciones adecuadas para que todos sus m\u00e1s de 3000 habitantes tengan acceso a los servicios b\u00e1sicos a pesar de que fue una zona que en el pasado no fue muy tomada en cuenta, pues hasta hace poco, muchos no gozaban el beneficio de tener agua potable o luz el\u00e9ctrica. Aqu\u00ed vive Estela, una mujer de 38 a\u00f1os que cada d\u00eda se levanta con la esperanza de ver sus sue\u00f1os hechos realidad, entre ellos el de ver a su hijo que actualmente tiene 19 a\u00f1os, convertido en un profesional de excelencia. Estela vive con su pareja Rafael de 44 a\u00f1os quien ha sido de gran apoyo. \nEstela desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a la crianza de ganado para producir leche y productos l\u00e1cteos y cuando el caso lo amerita la venta de los animales. Trabaja hasta doce horas diarias cuidando, aseando y sacando la leche de las vacas. La ayuda de su pareja es muy importante para ella y ahora est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con el cual comprar\u00e1 una \u201cvacona\u201d que es el nombre que se les da a las vacas que est\u00e1n pre\u00f1adas. Esto con el objetivo de producir tanto por medio de la vaca como tambi\u00e9n con su ternero. Estela se ha encontrado con varios obst\u00e1culos al querer obtener un capital, pues las garant\u00edas que ella ofrec\u00eda no eran suficientes, sin embargo, cuando se le pregunta a ella que es lo que la motiv\u00f3 a obtener el cr\u00e9dito con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, ella responde, que la convenci\u00f3 la agilidad y confianza que brindan adem\u00e1s del apoyo al sector rural, que brinda a trav\u00e9s del producto de Kiva con el cual adem\u00e1s muchas personas alrededor del mundo le ayudar\u00e1n a su crecimiento laboral. ","en":"In a rural parish in the city of Quito, Ecuador's capital, after following the dusty paths and breathing the country's pure air, we arrive at Nanegalito, a parish located to the northwest of Pichincha province.  This was the home of an Ecuadorean culture and it still holds some hidden stories of Ecuador's past.  This is a place with diverse flora and fauna, and clear rivers and waterfalls that attract both domestic and international visitors.  Businesses offer safe and exciting extreme sporting activities.  Another industry in the area is cattle raising, producing milk and meat, and agriculture, with sugar cane, yucca, reeds, oranges, mandarins and papayas grown here.  Handmade crafts are a also business opportunity here, with natural materials such as seed banks used to produce them.  With all this going on, local authorities worry about having the necessary facilities so that the more than 3000 inhabitants have access to basic services.  Despite this, this was a somewhat forgotten area in the past and until only recently many did not have access to running water or electricity.\r\n\r\nEstela, 38 years old, lives here and every day she wakes up with the hope of seeing her dreams becoming a reality.  These dreams include seeing her son, now 19 years old, become a professional.  Estela lives with her partner, Rafael, who is 44 years old and who has been a big support.  For eight years Estela has been raising cattle in order to produce milk and other dairy products and, when it's worth it, selling the animals.  Estela works 12 hours a day, looking after, washing and milking the cows.  The help from her partner is very important for her and now she is applying for a loan to buy a pregnant cow.  She is doing this with the aim of producing products from both the cow and her calf.  Estela has come across various obstacles while looking for capital.  The guarantees she was offering were not enough but when she is asked what motivated her to seek a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, she responds that she was convinced of the organisation's agility and their confidence in people.  In addition it supports the rural sector and, through Kiva, many people around the world are helping her in developing her career.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":1297839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a pregnant cow to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Nanegalito","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-02-20T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-22T08:30:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estela Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":417.92,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":45.7},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2013-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.91},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.12},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.94},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.14},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":45.7,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T10:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":46.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356494984,"comment":null},{"amount":50.91,"local_amount":50.06,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364524914,"comment":null},{"amount":52.12,"local_amount":51.25,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T09:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373133218,"comment":null},{"amount":52.94,"local_amount":52.06,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382313756,"comment":null},{"amount":222.56,"local_amount":218.85,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":222.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565363,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-20T11:19:36Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":529391,"name":"Gpf Rewb\u00e9 Golfe Bow Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9e de 35 ans, madame Fatoumata est la pr\u00e9sidente du groupe de cr\u00e9dit appel\u00e9 Rewbe Golfe Bow qui se compose de 5 femmes qui habitent dans le m\u00eame quartier et qui s\u2019activent dans des activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus.

For the past 2 years, Vanisha has been working hard to manage her drug shop, which sells tablets.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Vanisha has requested a loan of 200000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to stock more drugs for sell, and will help Vanisha to generate greater profits and expand her business up to the wholesale level. Vanisha hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a house.\r\n\r\nVanisha is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills

The source of income for the family is the monthly pension of Merab\u2019s mother. Merab has requested a loan from local financial institutions several time but his loan requests were always rejected because of low income and lack of experience in the new business. His current loan request was approved within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. Merab owns a car and plans to serve the locals as a taxi driver but he will have to charge higher prices for his service because of the benzene (fuel) price is high. Not many citizens can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the above mentioned problem, Merab has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from benzene to gas, which is cheaper than benzene and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 per cent. It will allow Merab to decrease the price of the service, which will attract more customers. Increasing the number of customers and cutting his costs will positively affect his profit. He will pay a local auto service center to change the fuel system. The increased income will be used for the family\u2019s well

Es soltera y para ella ha sido un reto muy dif\u00edcil el educar a su hijo sola, pero con el tiempo ha aprendido mucho de esta experiencia y ahora su hijo est\u00e1 estudiando en una escuela fiscal y \u00c1ngela sue\u00f1a con verlo convertido en un profesional. Vive con su peque\u00f1o hijo en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde, un lugar hist\u00f3rico de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\n\u00c1ngela lleva al sustento a su hogar y cubre los gastos de servicios b\u00e1sicos, educaci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s, gracias al negocio que emprendi\u00f3 hace 2 a\u00f1os con la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos de manera ambulante; ella recorre las largas calles de su ciudad tomando los pedidos de sus clientes que en la mayor\u00eda son mujeres.

Sin embargo tambi\u00e9n los fines de semana acompa\u00f1ada de su hijo acude a los domicilios de sus clientes para realizar labor de cobranzas. \u00c1ngela desea crecer con su negocio sin dejar desatendido su hogar, para lo cual ha requerido un pr\u00e9stamo para adecuar un espacio de su casa como un local de atenci\u00f3n a clientes que requieran los productos que ella mantiene en stock y as\u00ed ella no pierda ventas en las horas de la tarde que permanece con su hijo. \u00c1ngela agradece a Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa quienes le brindaron confianza y asesor\u00eda para dar este paso de crecimiento y adem\u00e1s motiva a las personas alrededor del mundo que aportan con personas como ella para que contin\u00faen realizando estos pr\u00e9stamos que tanto beneficio traen. ","en":"\u00c1ngela is a 29 year old woman. She grew up in a family with few economic resources. As a result it was not possible for her to continue studying after finishing primary school. She is a single mother. It has been a struggle to provide an education to her child all by herself, but over time she has learned a lot from this experience and her child is now is studying at a public elementary school. \u00c1ngela\u2019s dream is that her child will become a professional. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her young child in the parish of R\u00edo Verde, a place full of history. The parish is located in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas province in Ecuador, which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela maintains her family, paying the service bills for all their basic needs, such as education, etc. She does this thanks to the business she set up 2 years ago selling cosmetics door to door. She travels the long city streets taking orders from her customers who are mostly women. She works in the morning. In the afternoon she stays at home to help with homework and to do the household chores. But she works at weekends too when she goes, with her child, to her customers\u2019 homes to collect the payments she is owed. \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela wants to grow her business but still attend to her home. For this reason she has requested a loan. She will use this money to renovate a space in her house to serve customers who wish to buy the products she has in stock. In this way she will not lose potential sales when she is at home in the afternoon with her child. \u00c1ngela is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa who have advised her and placed their confidence in her.  This has enabled her to take the first step to growing her business. It also motivates people around the world to support those such as \u00c1ngela and to continue giving loans which are so beneficial.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":876.95,"image":{"id":1297917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She works making clothes such as skirts, blouses, dresses, and pants.  She also fixes clothing (using patches).  She does this work with the support of her cousin, who is also a dressmaker.  They used to work for a business, but the owner, for different reasons, closed the company and they decided to start their own business.  They learned this trade from relatives who also work in this trade and have 20 years of experience.  She works from her house and it can be said that her sewing is of high quality.\r\n\r\nShe has agreements with different schools in the area, where she makes them two uniforms per year.  They bring her all the fabric to make the uniforms and she only buys thread, buttons, zippers, plastic decorations for the blouses, etc.  She buys these accessories in stores that are located in the city that is 1 kilometer from her house.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is asking for from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy two new industrial sewing machines.  The main need that she will be able to satisfy with the granting of the loan is to buy two machines, since the ones she has aren't level and don't have the capacity that she requires.  In addition, she will be able to have more time to make more clothing once she buys two machines, if they fulfill her current needs.\r\n\r\nDorian has plans to begin construction on her house in the future.

The income is hardly enough to cover even food and everyday expenses for the family. \r\n\r\nIza requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for starting a trading business, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of her low income and the lack of experience in her job, which is usually demanded by the local credit providers. \r\n\r\nHer loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products because they are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Iza will purchase kitchen utensils and different kinds of household items in capital city open market for wholesale prices and resell them in her town for a profit. It will be hard work for Iza, but according to estimations, her business will be profitable and increase the income of the family.

Colleta is the featured borrower, and is pictured on the right of Sang'alo D Group with her hand raised. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan capable of planting a \u00bd  acre with sorghum, millet, and maize. Colleta joined One Acre Fund during the long rains 2009, and is now enrolling in the long rains 2013 season. Colleta joined One Acre Fund so that she could gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer, and access the best prices. \r\n\r\nColleta reports that before the One Acre Fund, she was able to grow about two bags of maize per acre, but with her One Acre Fund loan during long rains 2012, she harvested eight bags per 1\/2 acre! \r\n\r\nColleta described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year.

AbdulRahman is thinking of a way to raise his income in order to improve his family's living conditions and he is starting a transportation company. He is photographed  next to his new rickshaw.\r\n\r\nAbdulRahman is requesting a USD Murabaha loan from FATEN to help purchase a new vehicle to begin a transportation business. His loan will offer him another source of income to help him provide for his family. \r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Watta from Kulanda Town in Bo, Sierra Leone. She is 36 years old with three children and they all go to school. Watta runs a clothing store selling blouses, skirts and shirts. She works at her business 15 hours a day, 6 days a week.  \r\n\r\nWatta requested the loan to purchase more clothing for her store to sell during the dry season.

from Sierra Leone!

Mamie runs a local food business; she sells palm oil, chicken, garden eggs and gari (processed cassava flour). She has been running this business for 15 years. She works at the business every day, 6 days per week, and she has her children help her run the business. Her business is her only source of income. Mamie says that the main challenges to her business are slow purchasing power of her customers and occasional vehicle breakdowns on her way to the business. Mamie has applied for a loan in order to buy more palm oil, chickens, garden eggs and gari for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and help pay her grandchildren\u2019s fees. In the future, next year, she plans to have a bigger shop.

This businesswoman runs different sales in her business, one is selling used sewing machines (for domestic use) and the other is selling coconut oil. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing sewing machines to sell and coconuts from which to extract oil.\r\n\r\nPaula said that her most difficult challenge has been to raise her children and educate them while she has been working to support her long-term partner. She will use the profits to reinvest and to save for any needs in her family. She thanks you all for your support.

She has five sisters; four of whom are married and live independently, and one younger sister who helps with the household tasks.

Teresa is a very hard working woman, above all because she is a single mother and is getting her three children, aged 4, 10 and 14, ahead. For Teresa, her children are the best gift that God has been able to give her and are her reason for continuing to fight everyday despite the adversity that she faces. Teresa was only able to study up to the fifth grade of secondary school because her parents had minimum economic resources. She would have liked to have studied medicine. \r\n\r\nDay to day, Teresa works as an employee in the mornings and in the afternoons she sells her goods including tamales, parboiled eggs, corn and cheese, and other items. She passes through the streets of her neighborhood on a tricycle, so that she can have an extra source of income to move her family forward. She belives that she is getting ahead because she is responsible and has a strong desire to improve. \r\n\r\nTeresa is very thankful for the support that Kiva lenders are bringing to her because thanks to this help she will be able to buy construction materials including cement, sand, bricks and other items. With these materials she will be able to build a business space and improve her customer service, allowing her to continue fighting to make her most sought after dream come true--to give her children the chance to become professionals.

Both are single. They are from the department of Chinandega, which is located in the western part of the country, which is a very commercial area with a lot of activity. Delmi has two children, ages 3 and 7, both of whom are in school. She began her business with the help of her mother, who has always supported her, and as the opportunity arose to sell to sugar mill workers, she decided to set out on her own, and, thanks to God, it has gone well for her so far. Martha has five children, ages 24, 29, 30, 31, and 34, all of whom are working. She began her business looking for a means of subsistence because her children were in school. She was both mother and father at the same time for them. First she began with the sale of soft drinks and enchiladas on buses, but later she began to prepare meals, and in this way she began to acquire customers. Now her business is her main source of employment. Each has had her business for more than 10 years. They are applying for the loan to buy rice, beans, oil, disposable plates, soft drinks, sugar, coffee, and other items. The San Ram\u00f3n group is grateful for the help that the Kiva investors offer to people of scarce resources and poor countries such as Nicaragua to have a means of dignified

","en":"Mohira is 20 years old, single, and lives with her parents. She took a course entitled \"Get Ahead\" organised by the Association of Businesswomen and for which she received a certificate. Now she wants to set up her own business. She needs a source of income because the earnings of her father, who grows crops for a living, are very small. The family recently hosted a celebration and their savings were depleted. They are currently facing very difficult living conditions, which is why Mohira really needs support. She is seeking a loan of 850 US dollars to buy cattle so she can start her own business. She has experience raising cattle and considers this field to be a profitable one to get into, since there is a great demand for cattle on the local market.

She lives with her husband, Ever, and young son, Pa\u00fal, whom she looks after in a rural house that she inherited five years ago.  Mary Luz has lived in the country since she was born and she learned to look after and work the land, alongside her parents who were also peasant farmers.  Her parents taught her agricultural techniques and how to raise cattle.  \"At first I only planted various foods, I had a lot of problems which led me to be more cautious.  Now I only sow a small amount,\" she says.  These agricultural failings helped her now to work with cattle, particularly raising cows.  She has nine of them, which provide the milk she needs to make cheese, her main work.  She says that she makes 40 units of cheese per day to sell in the cities of Lima and Huancayo.  This helps her to improve her income.  Her wish for the future is to increase the number of cows she has so as to produce 300 litres of milk a day and so be able to sell her milk to one of the country's largest processing businesses.

quedaron seis integrantes tres de ellas son nuevas y tres de ellas ya estaban trabajando con la instituci\u00f3n. El nombre del grupo lo eligieron porque ellas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de bordados. Do\u00f1a Zenaida se integra al grupo ella tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada desde hace 21 a\u00f1os con el se\u00f1or Rom\u00e1n juntos han formado una familia con dos hijos de los cuales se encuentran estudiando Don Rom\u00e1n trabaja en la construcci\u00f3n mientras que Do\u00f1a Zenaida desde hace 21 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 ayudar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar elaborando sus bordados para posteriormente venderlos, esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n para comprar material como, tela, hilos de distintos colores, agujas especiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas como colchas, gabanes, chalecos, su\u00e9teres, etc. Do\u00f1a Zenaida platica que dese muy peque\u00f1a ella ve\u00eda como su mam\u00e1 se dedicaba a la elaboraci\u00f3n de estas artesan\u00edas le llamaba mucho la atenci\u00f3n poco a poco viendo aprendi\u00f3 solo que algunos puntos como el de trencilla se le dificultaba elaborarlos pero afortunadamente pudo aprender con el tiempo, la se\u00f1ora Zenaida argumento: \u201cMe gusta mucho realizar mi trabajo por una parte porque es una manera de ayudar a mi esposo con los gastos del hogar, con la educaci\u00f3n de mis hijos pero por otra parte es para conservar nuestras artesan\u00edas ya que con el tiempo se han ido perdiendo muchas personas ya no valoran nuestro trabajo como nosotras quisi\u00e9ramos\u201d. Comenta esto porque no les pagan lo que realmente es el precio de la prenda. Do\u00f1a Zenaida va a vender sus artesan\u00edas a una tienda de ropa en la capital ah\u00ed deja sus artesan\u00edas para que las escojan y regresa para ver si ya se vendieron solo que muchas veces no les regresan sus prendas ni su dinero y simplemente les dicen \u201cla prenda se perdi\u00f3\u201d al parecer es la \u00fanica manera de sacar a la venta sus artesan\u00edas porque estar ofreciendo de casa en casa o en otras comunidades es muy dif\u00edcil que las compren y si las llegan a comprar es muy dif\u00edcil que les paguen es por eso que llevan sus artesan\u00edas a una tienda de la capital.\nZenaida est\u00e1 muy contenta por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado porque le ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para comprar el material que le hace falta y as\u00ed podr\u00e1 seguir trabajando con la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus prendas artesanales a Do\u00f1a Zenaida le gustar\u00eda que sus hijos puedan terminar una carrera profesional para que puedan tener un mejor sustento econ\u00f3mico. Las integrantes del grupo son Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles quien invertir\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito en productos de belleza, Mar\u00eda Juana, Nancy, Zenaida, Mar\u00eda de la Luz, Angelina ellas compraran material para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas. Ellas como Zenaida est\u00e1n muy agradecidas con KIVA y VisionFund por todos los cr\u00e9ditos otorgados.\n","en":"The communal bank Artesanas del Fresno has had several loan cycles with the institution. This time there are just six members, three who are new and three who have worked with the institution. The group chose its name based on the members' needlework.  Zenaida, a member, is 42 and has been married to Rom\u00e1n for 21 years. Their two children are students. Rom\u00e1n is a construction worker, and Zenaida decided 21 years ago to help her husband meet household expenses by doing needlework to sell. \r\n\r\nShe is applying to the institution for a loan to buy materials such as fabric, different colors of thread, and special needles to make handicrafts like quilts, coats, vests, and jerseys. Zenaida says that, as a child, she carefully watched her mother make handicrafts and slowly learned the trade. Some techniques such as braiding were difficult, but she was able to learn them over time. Zenaida claims, \u201cI like my work because it lets me help my husband with expenses and our children's education, but it also is a way to preserve our craftsmanship, which many people have lost because they don't appreciate our work as much as we would like.\" She feels this way because the selling price doesn't cover the cost of making the garments.\r\n\r\nZenaida will sell her garments to a clothing store in the capital. She can leave the merchandise there so the vendors can make a selection. She goes back to see if items have been sold because often the vendors don't return her garments or pay her and simply say that the garments were lost. It seems to be the only way to sell artesania, as selling door-to-door in other towns is very hard; if people buy, it's hard to collect payments. So, she takes her merchandise to the store in the capital.\r\n\r\nZenaida is happy to have the loan because it will allow her to buy the material she needs to keep creating handmade garments. Zenaida would love to see her children follow a professional career that would provide more income. The communal bank members are: Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, who will buy cosmetics, and Mar\u00eda Juana, Nancy, Zenaida, Mar\u00eda de la Luz, and Angelina, who will buy materials to make artesan\u00eda. Like Zenaida, they are grateful to KIVA and VisionFund for the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":1295376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy materials such as fabric, different colors of thread, and special needles to make handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2013-02-21T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-03-23T17:40:06Z","loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2375},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":190.63,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199301,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596094,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663522,"comment":null},{"amount":381.25,"local_amount":4750,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048937,"comment":null},{"amount":190.62,"local_amount":2375,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2411.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381840104,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-02-21T20:55:45Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:07:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":530202,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana, de 33 a\u00f1os esta casada y tiene dos hijos, a quienes desea poder brindarles una buena educaci\u00f3n y una mejor calidad de vida, viven juntos en su casa propia, lugar que logr\u00f3 comprar a base de esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n.El trabajo de Juana consiste en la venta de s\u00e1banas.
