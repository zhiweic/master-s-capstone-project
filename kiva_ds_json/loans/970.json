24-year-old Elizabeth from Waterloo eastern area in Freetown, Sierra Leone. She is married and a mother with one child aged 4 years old.  She has two additional dependents at home. In 2007, Elizabeth established her general merchandise business at Waterloo market. She began her business because her parents forced her to marriage at an early age without her completing her secondary school education. She works at the business 11 hours a day and 7 days per week.

They work very hard to offer their children a better quality of life. Lelis's work is selling snacks such as cookies, cereals, candies and more as well as bottled and fresh juice. She makes the fresh juice from delicious regional fruit such as papaya, pineapple and oranges. She sells everyday starting very early from the sidewalk in front of her house where she has a sales stand. Her business is very profitable because her house is close to a preschool and a high school. These become great allies when it comes time to sell. A lot of mothers want their children to drink refreshing juice to start their morning and study happily. What she likes about her job is that she can use her time as she likes because she is independent and she organizes her days according to what she needs. This way, she can be with her family and do the housework. Over time, she hopes to establish a formal business where she can work more comfortably. This is loan number 5 with the MFP institution.

is 30 years old. She lives in the Telavi District with her husband, Shalva, her 3-year-old daughter and her mother-in-law. Marina requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe only source of income for the family is a small income of Shalva, taking wood from the forest and selling it in their village. It makes a total of 200 Laris per month. It is hardly enough for food for a four-member family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nMarina requested a loan from Credo to re-start-up the family business, which was stopped recently because of financial problems. Her loan request was approved in the framework of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

She also has an experienced driver who arrives are her house each day to pick up that vehicle, which he uses to work in the city streets. She has been renting this motortaxi for over 4 years now and it has gone very well for her because she has a fixed daily income the helps her family to pay their basic household expenses. Lice has been supplementing this income by also selling clothing for the last three years with the help of her daughter. What she likes about her job is that she can organize her time and make herself available when she needs to attend to something else. This allows her to fulfill her responsibilities as a mother and wife, while remaining a capable and independent woman. Lice hopes to continue in this way to work and at the same time fully attend to her responsibilities at home. \r\nHer biggest dream is to establish a formal, productive business out of her own home and break into food sales.

She is married and has two adult children. They all live together in their own house.\r\n\r\nLita's business consists of a public-transport vehicles rental. She has four mototaxis, which she rents out everyday to drivers that come to her house looking for a means to work. She gets paid for this service and the profits make it possible for her to cover the basic needs at home. Sometimes, it is her children or siblings who drive the vehicles, and sometimes friends. All her vehicles are in good shape. However, the legal documents of two of them are close to their expiration date.\r\n\r\nShe has been working in this line of work for ten years, and she started from scratch, with optimism and commitment in everything she does. Sometimes, she complements this activity, with her son's help, selling fish that she sends to other cities. What she likes about her job is that she has time left to spend close to her family and to take care of the household chores. Besides, the economic income she generates makes it possible to cover everyday needs at home. \r\n\r\nShe is doing well so far. She hopes to continue this way, so that her vehicle fleet increases in number. This is the second loan with MFP.

She is a married woman and mother of two children. She lives with her husband and children in Kamalen Sirakoro, a peripheral neighborhood of the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nKadidiatou has been buying and selling used clothing for about three years now. She has a strong reputation in this line of business and receives lots of orders, especially in the cold season. So, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso program about two years ago. This is her third individual loan through Soro Yiriwaso. The two previous loans were both correctly repaid. With this third loan, she plans to buy 4 bales of various types of used clothing (sweaters, T-shirts, shirts, and socks) from wholesalers. She travels around, reselling her goods to a clientele made up of mostly heads of families in her town.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to earn a monthly profit of 190,000 FCFA, which she will mainly put towards family expenses and paying off the interest of her loan. She will invest the rest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1217764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

photographed next to his taxi, is a 25 year old young man. He is married and a father to two sons and one daughter.\r\n\r\nFor the past seven years, Ayoub has been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project and the only source of income for the family. He is requesting a USD loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing a new engine for the taxi he drives. This will increase the taxi capacity to work extra hours and enable Ayoub to take additional internal and external requests, which will improve the family's income positively.\r\n\r\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext:

During the seasons when demand is high, she sells in the communities on the riverbanks, where she also exchanges clothing for domestic animals.  She raises, feeds, and sells the animals.  She has been doing this work for over 11 years.  It has been going very well for her ever since she started.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the need to care for her minor children has caused her to think about establishing a business that would allow her to be at home all day and to generate income.  That is why she now wishes to rent video games.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she always has customers who need an article of clothing.  What she does not like is having to travel for hours transporting the heavy bags of merchandise.  Now, she is putting all of her hopes in the new business activity that she wishes to undertake.  Although, she confirms that, in any event, she will continue selling clothes.  However, this time she will sell at her house.  In order to do so she needs to have a good area to display the clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan with MFP.  She has always been known in her group as a responsible person.  She is happy for the opportunity given to her in order to make a good investment.  Also, she is sure that she will continue making her payments on time, like she has done so far.

Nargis is a 29 year old married woman. She efficiently runs a beauty parlor in her community. She works hard day and night to make her parlor famous so she may be able to provide for her family a better living standard. \r\n\r\nMs Nargis is contributing a lot to the income that supports her family.

","en":"Toktobubu is a member of the group \"Ozgorush.\" She is 64 years old and has 5 children. As the main breadwinner of the family, Toktobubu grows crops and raises cattle. Thanks to her persistent hard work, Toktobubu's farm has 1 dairy cow and calf, as well as irrigated land with potatoes and beans. Her monthly income is approximately 1,700 Som (KGS).

She is married and has six children who are now grown and only two that now live with her: one boy who is 31 years old and her daughter who is 27 years old. Together, they live in their own house. Nilda's work consists of retail selling of groceries, that is to say, she buys the products in great quantities and from there she sells them in small units.She has a small store installed in a space in her house, which she was able to construct due to the support of her spouse.\r\n\r\nAmong other products that she offers, she has rice, sugar, eggs, oil, canned goods, soft drinks, condiments, and others. Her schedule starts very early in the morning and ends at night. She has been in this line of work since she was 15 years old. Thanks to this job, she has been able to educate her children and outfit her house with some fixtures. In general, she works by herself and in some cases receives the help of her daughter while her spouse, son, and grandson work outside the home.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she has time to do multiple activities inside of her home. It is going very well for her, since she always has customers to attend to, her income is considerable, and this allows her to purchase her products on a continual basis. For now, she prefers to continue with what she has, frequently purchasing the same quantities of products, but later she hopes to implement some changes in the infrastructure of her store.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP. She was always a very good member in the community bank, where she is highly valued for being a responsible and supportive member.

Together they have a 6 year old child who is her reason for living and for whom she works daily to give him a better quality of life.  Together they live in their in-laws' house who help them in taking care of their son.\r\n\r\nOlga's work is in the line of repairs on home appliances from White Line, and also in the sales of parts for the same products.  She works together with her partner, and they make really good team of workers.  Before that, she worked in another line of work and her partner worked as a helper in a home appliance parts store, in which he worked to find new customers.  But now they have left these jobs and for the past year they have been working in their own business and they are well received.  They do repairs on washers, ovens, microwaves, rice cookers, and other appliances.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that she has time free to work quietly without being unable to care for her son, and also that she works with her partner, and this is very satisfying for her.

After the breakup of the Union and to provide the primary source of income, she became involved in animal husbandry and farming, having started this business with a sum of 5,000 som.

Ahmad has also a parallel job; he works as an electrician at a local company. Ahmad always wanted to better develop his business and improve his work, but until now he has earned a barely fair income. For that reason he decided to take a loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l to purchase an electrical generator for his business.

She began her business in the municipality of Soledad, to the south of Barranquilla, purchasing a refrigerator to sell beer, lunches, and liquor, but after 9 years her family and her moved to Barranquilla to a neighborhood called La Playa. This location is better because it is a touristic location where the people go to swim in La Cienaga, a coastal lake. Now she sells her products to neighbors and visitors from a fixed location that she succeeded in purchasing after many years selling there.\n\nNow Maria is applying for a Kiva loan to purchase a freezer to store her products. She also wants to purchase a greater number of beer directly from the truck, which is cheaper and has no intermediary. She thinks she will be able to sell more beer if she can refrigerate them, because people always want cold beer. Maria hopes that with the increase in her income because of this loan, she can improve her home, where she lives with her husband, a son of 34 years of age, and an 11 year old daughter, to be able to improve the room conditions and to feel happier at the side of the family who she loves.

With two personal loans fully repaid, she is currently seeking a loan to buy 10 bags of potatoes, 45 kilograms of beef, 60 kilograms of fresh fish, 15 liters of cooking oil, five packs of Maggi (bouillon flavoring cubes), five bottles of vinegar, 30 packets of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 (local dish prepared from fermented, dried cassava pulp), four sacks of charcoal, 50 loaves of bread, and plantains for making aloko (thinly sliced, deep-fried plantains).\r\n\r\nMinata hopes to make a monthly income of 190,000 FCFA. She will use her income primarily to contribute to family expenses, and to pay the interest on her loan. She plans to use the remainder to re-invest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1217783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients for her restaurant business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103100,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243365,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":40485,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624944,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179844,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922646,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636198,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373029751,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40485,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819341,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678248,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":40485.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678249,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T08:19:18Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T13:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484674,"name":"Olga Indelira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"OLGA INDELIRA tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad es divorciada tiene tres hijos, vive con los hijos y unos familiares en Ventans provincia de los R\u00edos.\n\nEs integrante de la VRC 16 DE AGOSTO, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto Agua de Mocache, pertenece al Cant\u00f3n Mocache se dedican a labores agr\u00edcolas y pecuarias.\n\nOLGA INDELIRA se dedica a la agricultura y a la crianza de animales.

He lives with his two wives and their children in Hamdallaye, a popular district in the city of Sikasso.\r\n\r\nNever having had the opportunity to attend school, Bakary began marketing fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. He has now been running this business for over twenty years. Bakary has a strong reputation and has earned many commendations from his clientele. Unfortunately, he lacks the resources to meet the ever-increasing demands of his customers. With the loan he is currently seeking, Bakary plans to purchase 20 sacks of urea fertilizer, 10 sacks of complex fertilizers for cotton, and 10 sacks of complex fertilizers for corn. Bakary is on his fifth loan cycle, and all four of his previous loans have been repaid in full. Bakary purchases his supplies in Sikasso from a representative of Toguna Industries (a fertilizer manufacturer). His clientele is composed primarily of farmers, some of whom pay in cash, and others who buy on credit.\r\n\r\nWith the income he earns from this loan, Bakary expects to make a monthly income of 175,000 FCFA. He plans to use this income to pay for essential expenditures, family expenses, to pay the interest on his loan, and to re-invest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1217791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase fertilizers for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T20:40:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323103102,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243367,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624946,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T15:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347179846,"comment":null},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T19:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":67475.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355922648,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":67475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364636200,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-24T00:13:26Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T12:33:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483059,"name":"Jumaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jumaa is married, has three children, two in school, and lives in the Kongowea area of Coast province, Kenya.

Misbha works tirelessly to keep the business running because she plays a vital role in supporting her family. Her husband is employed in a factory and is paid less than the family's expenses.

It was formed in the year 2010. Its four members are women from a small rural village called Barpadar. It is situated in the district of Nuapada of Odisha, one of the poorest districts in India particularly known for drought and underdevelopment. Anadi is one of the members of this group. \r\n\r\nThe lady sitting second from left raising her hand in the photo is Anadi. She is the Group Leader. She is 38 years old and is living with her husband, her only daughter who is eight, her two sons who are 20 & 18 and her father in-law. Anadi hails from a very poor, landless, illiterate Schedule Caste (SC) Below Poverty Line family. Anadi's community is socially, economically and educationally very backward and far from the mainstream. One will hardly find graduates in their community. Anadi resides in a small hut with her family. \r\n\r\nAnadi is running a business preparing and selling different items made of a rope that is made from plastic cement bags. She took over the business from her fore fathers who used to make rope from cow and buffalo skin. The items are used particularly for tightening domestic animals like cows, buffalo, sheep, goats etc, for manually extracting water from a well by using a tin bucket and other works related to cultivation. Her husband and younger son help Anadi in the total process from collection of empty cement bags from the contractors and builders, processing of string into small wires and making the plastic rope items to selling the products. They sell them in five weekly markets each week. Her family works 8-10 hours daily to make those items. Her husband procures empty cement bags at Rs 2\/- per bag. In a week, she earns almost 1000-1500 INR from this business. She gets around 40% profits. Her elder son works as a salesman in a grocery shop, but in comparison to all this i.e. the labor, transporting and material costs, this is not at all cost effective. So very miserably, she manages her family. Presently, the stock she buys from her locality is not enough for her to make items for the entire week. Her husband moves frequently to collect empty bags, which is very time and energy consuming and hampers her production. She wants to have enough stock to support her business uninterrupted. The loan will be used by her to buy more stock of empty cement bags and a bicycle for her son to earn some extra income. \r\n\r\nAnadi dreams of building a small pucca (permanent) house for her family and for the marriage of her elder son. The other three members of her group are Rashmita, Debaki and Jasoda who are doing a similar business of making ropes. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase empty cement bags and a bicycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Barpadar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T22:00:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rashmita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debaki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasoda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T00:40:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483126,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn makes a living by selling bananas and coconuts.

He has also become familiar with the cities around the country.  \"I know almost all of Per\u00fa.\" he says.\r\n\r\nRight now, he has his own land as well as leased land, which takes about an hour to reach.  There he plants potatoes, peas, lima beans, ollucos (root vegetables grown in Peru, similar to a potatoes) and other agricultural products that he sells at the market in his city.  He works with great care, and thanks to the \"proyecto sierra productiva\" where he works, he has learned to grow his crops organically.  \"Natural products are always good. When I was a child my parents planted in this way,\" he says.  It is for this reason that in all of his conversations with, and advice to, other farmers, he puts emphasis on pre-modern agricultural practices.  Alejandro also makes a living raising cattle, pigs, sheep and guinea pigs, which he owns and cares for with a great deal of dedication.\r\n\r\nHe would like to continue planting and improving his crops.  This is loan number 7 with MFP.  During the time he has been a member, he has demonstrated responsibility and solidarity with the group.  He really enjoys belonging to this organization, and so he promises to be punctual in his payments.  He is also grateful for the financial support he has received during these years.  Alejandro will invest the money in the purchase of organic fertilizers for his crops, and if there is enough money he will buy food for a balanced diet for his animals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1216366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizers for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-10-16T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-15T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84.81},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":87.69},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.89},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.08},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":74.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":77.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447739,"comment":null},{"amount":31.57,"local_amount":78.93,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":81.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053657,"comment":null},{"amount":32.89,"local_amount":82.23,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":85.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188595,"comment":null},{"amount":33.92,"local_amount":84.81,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":87.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572507,"comment":null},{"amount":35.08,"local_amount":87.69,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":90.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347122167,"comment":null},{"amount":36.54,"local_amount":91.35,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":94.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355867993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T00:57:28Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:23:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484690,"name":"Oscar Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al lado de su esposa con la cual tiene 2 hijos de 20 y 10 a los a quienes ama mucho y por quienes trabaja muy duro para darle una vida mejor; la vivienda de Oscar se encuentra en la ciudad de Nazca, ciudad que se caracteriza por tener un clima c\u00e1lido y acogedor, asimismo se desarrolla la agricultura y la ganader\u00eda.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nYolanda dreams to give her family a good life through all her hard work on her business.

is Teresita, 56. She is a resident of Caloocan, Philippines, and is married to Fernando, a technician and the father of her children. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continue providing income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local community. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies wholesale and selling them at retail prices. Her regular customers are her neighbors and other members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Teresita is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages and expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her product line. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams of giving her family a good life through all her hard work on her business. She meets faithfully with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":1214682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages and expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10046.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315351005,"comment":null},{"amount":193.33,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8037.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322960111,"comment":null},{"amount":193.33,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8037.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094825,"comment":null},{"amount":96.67,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4018.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339483981,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T09:42:20Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:27:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483146,"name":"Marcelina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelina is from Masabud, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

She has been in the business for sixteen years and is still doing better. \r\n\r\nPenden is now requesting a loan of 50,000 PHP to increase her working capital.

Her house is in the city of Ica, a city that is known for having a warm and welcoming climate, and it has developed agriculturally, especially growing cotton, grapes, and asparagus, among others.\r\n\r\nDoraliza could only study until the third grade of secondary school, but would have liked to study to be a nurse, but has always instilled in her children above all to study.\r\n\r\nEvery day Doraliza works as a housekeeper and also has a small business selling birds, especially ducks, offering them to restaurants in the city for the preparation of one of the most delicious dishes of the country, which is the tasty rice with duck. She works around nine hours a day and she thinks it is going well because she is trustworthy, honest and above all she has a lot of faith in God.\r\n\r\nDoraliza is very grateful to the Kive lenders and thanks to the help they have given her she can buy supplies such as iron, cement, bricks, etc. in order to build her bathroom, as currently it is adobe. In this way she can improve the quality of life for her family and be able to continue fighting in order to reach her biggest dream: \u201cProviding a good education to the children and to have a larger business.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1216046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

What he basically does is buy second-hand cars from sellers, then he upgrades or repairs them and sells them for a profit. Cars can range from lower-end to updated models. Customers are attracted to buy due to the fair selling prices he offers. His regular customers are people who wanted to acquire a vehicle in their local community. Ricafort earns a minimum of PHP 10,000 in sales every month.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, Ricafort is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to do repairs and upgrades on cars that he buys. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. Ricafort dreams of expanding his business in the coming years. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week, and it is where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 50 years old, living with her husband; one son, age 25; and her daughter-in-law, age 22. Prema hails from the very poor, landless, illiterate Schedule Caste (SC) Below Poverty Line category. She is running a rope-making, procuring and selling business. This is a traditional business in her community. Previously, the people of this community used to make rope from cow and buffalo skin. Due to social restrictions and progressive mindset, this has been replaced with plastic rope. These items are specially used to fasten domestic animals like cows, buffaloes, sheep and goats. \r\n\r\nHer husband and son help Prema in all aspects of the business from the processing part to selling of the products in different weekly markets in her locality. Her entire family works 8-10 hours daily making these items. Her husband covers six weekly markets a week by using public transport and a bicycle for selling the products. Apart from this, her husband also goes collecting raw materials from different contractors and builders which is a very time-consuming task and hampers the production. In a week, her family earns 1,500 to 2,000 Indian rupees (INR) which is not sufficient to manage her family.\r\n\r\nPrema wants to increase her income by adding some extra stock of empty cement bags and a self transport facility. She wants to have enough stock to allow her business to run throughout the year smoothly. Prema wants to utilize the present loan to purchase more stock of empty cement bags and to procure ready-made products from her locality.\r\n\r\nPrema dreams of having a bike for transporting and marketing her products as per her own sweet will. She also wants to construct a house, as her family is living jointly in a small house. \r\n\r\nThe other five members of her group (Kshyanaprabha, Dukhli, Bandei, Bilash and Bhumisuta) belong to the same community and are doing a similar business related to rope-making and selling. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for purchasing empty cement bags and procurement of ready-made items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Barpadar,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T03:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T03:00:11Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kshyanaprabha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilash","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bhumisuta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ban","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dukhli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":72000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T11:17:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":484731,"name":"Oscar Elias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar, necesita capital para invertir en el cultivo de granos b\u00e1sicos, es por eso que esta nuevamente esta  solicit\u00e1ndonos un cr\u00e9dito, que le ayudara en la compra de tres sacos de abono para mejorar su cultivo y brindarles un mejor grano a sus clientes.\n\nEl nos dice que el pr\u00e9stamo anterior le ayudo a mejorar sus cultivos, ahora tiene una mejor capacidad de inversi\u00f3n  y su econom\u00eda aumento para tener una vida agradable junto a su familia.\n\n","en":"Oscar needs working capital to buy supplies to grow grain.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<i>Sarvodaya<\/i> (\"Overall Development\"), a Joint Liability Group, was formed in the year 2010 by four active women of Khariar town of Nuapada district in Odisha, India. Nuapada district is known for drought and backwardness. Sunita is one of the members of this group, standing second from the left with a raised hand. She is 33 years of age and lives with her husband; one son, age 3; her father-in-law and mother in-law. \r\n\r\nSunita has been running a small mirror-cutting and binding unit in her house and a photo framing shop for the last five years with the active support of her husband. Her husband goes to a wholesale market 200 kilometres away twice in a month and brings back raw materials like mirrors, framing items and cardboard. In her unit, she has engaged two workers for cutting and binding mirrors of different sizes as per the orders of the traders. She supplies these mirrors wholesale to five traders from the same town and one trader from a nearby town. From this business she earns a monthly income of 6,000 to 7,000 Indian rupees (INR). With her previous loans, Sunita has taken a cabin in the heart of the town for marketing her products as well as photo framing.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan and Sunita wants to purchase a photo lamination machine as well as mirrors and binding materials for the smooth running of her business. This will reduce the transportation costs and she will be able to work for a long period. She expects a good return from this investment for the total development of her business. With this extra income, she is planning to repair and renovate the cutting and binding unit she is running in a temporary shed. Sunita hopes to open a mirror showroom in the market with quality products. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of this group are Sanjukta, Sannu and Premalata. They are running a grocery shop, small restaurant and X-ray center respectively.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to pay for purchasing a photo lamination machine, mirrors, cardboard and binding materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"KHARIAR,NUAPADA,ODISHA","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T03:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T03:50:01Z","loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sannu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sunita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Premalata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanjukta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":148000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":148000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-17T15:20:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483189,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is a mechanic and owns his own garage, which has been in existence for the past five years.

What she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers, then she sell them per piece\/pack with a profit. Products can range from ham to hot dogs, processed pork and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nArlene hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a vendor and opened a small shop in a district of the capital a year ago.  Because of this work she is able to assist her husband with taking care of their family.  Her neighborly relations and her warmth have helped her customer base to grow with time.  Her only problem is that she does not have enough funds to increase the stock of merchandise for her shop to avoid running out of certain items.

The prime income source of that locality is cultivation. This village is far away from education, sanitation, advanced facilities, etc. \r\n\r\nThe lady standing second from left in the pink sari with raised hand is Sumati. She lives with five family members consisting of her husband; two sons, aged 15 and 13; and one daughter, 5 years of age. Her children are continuing study in school. She is a very kind-hearted person, hardworking and enthusiastic, who always devotes her efforts to getting her family ahead. \r\n \r\nFor 13 years, Sumati has been running a general grocery shop. Initially, she started the business in a low profile with limited items like potatoes, soap, sugar, tea dust, tobacco, chocolates, etc. Gradually, she expanded her business and added extra items regularly. Due to her good behavior, her business has grown rapidly. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2008, with her able leadership, Sumati, along with other three women of her small village, formed a Joint Liability Group named Matrushakti, which means \u201cmother\u2019s power,\u201d to take loans from Mahashakti Foundation for the development of their businesses. All members hail from poor backgrounds in the \"below poverty line\" category. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan of her group. During the last three loans, Sumati has been able to add some grocery items like dough, vegetables, oil, spices, soda (soft drinks) etc. and also a refrigerator for her shop. Every day from the early morning she starts her work at a stretch of ten hours. Now she is earning 500 INR daily from her business. \r\n\r\nSumati wants to keep more stock for her shop but, due to financial scarcity, her husband has to go to the nearest market to buy items for her grocery shop regularly. Due to frequent purchases, she incurred losses in transportation. So from the present loan she has planned to buy merchandise for her business such as rice, sugar, vegetables, oil, noodles, potato, onion, dough, soda, etc., in bulk. She expects to increase her sales and, thereby, her income, which will serve to ensure the education and welfare of her children. \r\n \r\nSumati hopes to build a permanent cabin in the center of her village for running her business. She also hopes to provide better education to her children. \r\n\r\nThe other three members of the group are Ghame, Jayantidei and Santi running spice-selling and milk-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1214440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for purchasing of grocery items in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Torli,Nuapada,Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2012-10-17T14:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-11-16T14:00:35Z","loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sumati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghame","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayantidei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":112000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-10-22T16:52:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":483250,"name":"Pedrita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pedrita is a 56 year old married woman with three grown children from Baclayon, Bohol, Philippines.
