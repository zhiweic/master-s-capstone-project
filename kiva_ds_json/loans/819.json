She is married to Constantino, a driver, and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEditha oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney and are paying boundary (a daily fee) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,800 Philippine pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Editha is requesting a 26,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment for their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha dreams of being able to buy another jeepney. She also dreams that her grandchildren will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n<u>Footnote:<\/u>\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Therefore she works as hard as she can to ensure that in the future she can give him the best living conditions possible.  Delys has a beauty salon where she provides professional services for improving one's image such as hair cuts, massages, coiffure, manicure, pedicure, etc., and she also advises on beauty products, depending on each customer.  Selling the products generates an income used to help with household expenses.  Delys has been able to get ahead with her son with help from her mother.  She has dedicated much time to training and acquiring beauty skills, as well as learning about administration, so she can appropriately manage her business.\r\n\r\nHer salon is well appointed and set up in her mother's house.  Her mother is in the same business and agrees with Delys about her son's well-being.  With her work Delys has been able to buy her own home.  Her goal for the future is to have her own academy to generate stable employment.  The greatest challenge she is up against is working capital, of which there is not enough to meet the market demand as far as buying unequaled, quality products that are sure to be sold is concerned.

is Liezel, 40, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Prudencio, a transport operator, and they have one child. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, Liezel is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLiezel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Liezel is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLiezel hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Con este negocio Nuris se vincul\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, desde los cuales ha recibido 6 financiamientos, con los que ha logrado comprar en mayor volumen sus productos y con el resultado de su venta programa los pagos y se siente muy tranquila de poder hacerlo f\u00e1cilmente. Su meta futura es apoyar la ampliaci\u00f3n del Gimnasio de su hijo, adecuando otra sala donde incluir\u00eda a su vez nuevos productos. Su mayor desaf\u00edo son las bajas temporadas en las cuales no hay muchos clientes como ella lo espera, pero en su experiencia conoce cuales son estas \u00e9pocas y puede controlar sus inversiones. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su s\u00e9ptimo credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 productos energ\u00e9ticos y continuar\u00e1 aumentand su capital de trabajo por eso su credikiva es un \u00e9xito para  su nueva  inversi\u00f3n.","en":"Nuris is 62 years old, lives south of the city, and has 2 children ages 30 and 35. She has a business where she sells energy products specially aimed towards people that do a physical activity like exercises or aerobics. Her business began when her son started a gym and his customers, when finished working out, would need to hydrate themselves in order to replenish the loss of liquid in their body. With this business Nuris joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation 4 years ago. Since then she has received 6 loans, with which she has been able to purchase her products in larger volumes  and with the results of her sales she feels calm about being able to make the payments easily. Her future goal is to support the growth of her son's gym, adapting another room where she would include her products. Her greatest challenge are the low seasons in which there aren't as many customers as she hopes, but in her experience she knows when these periods are and can control her investments. Currently she is applying for her 7th kiva credit with which she will buy energy products and will continue increasing her work capital so that her kiva credit is a success for her new investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1050558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"to buy

This way she will be able to have greater variety and gather the money necessary to start a boutique in another place, which will allow her to buy her own house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1050452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase coffins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Giuliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":202.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":213.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":228.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":234.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":242.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":253.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":260.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":271.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":280.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":290.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":302.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76,"local_amount":202.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":202.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276602069,"comment":null},{"amount":80.03,"local_amount":213.42,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":213.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283091185,"comment":null},{"amount":81.71,"local_amount":217.87,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":218.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222248,"comment":null},{"amount":85.75,"local_amount":228.69,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":228.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298315,"comment":null},{"amount":371.89,"local_amount":991.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":992.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322954110,"comment":null},{"amount":429.62,"local_amount":1145.66,"processed_date":"2013-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364483467,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-20T06:55:00Z","paid_date":"2013-05-17T09:47:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407480,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

When she started this commercial activity, she did it selling artificial flowers which were given to her by suppliers on consignment, i.e. she returned the flowers that did not sell. In this way she made her first customers and gradually she got to know more people who recommended her and she took orders like silver garments and articles for the home, among others. Her business was inspired by the need to generate income and bring together those produced by her husband, also a hard worker who works as a refrigerator technician. With that, the possibilities to generate wellbeing in her home increased and once she had the trust of her customers, she gradually bought window cases and equipment and increased her merchandise with which she has managed to establish her miscellaneous shop which is located in a strategic place. To achieve her career goals is very important to Norayma because she dreams of supporting her daughters in their goal of becoming successful professionals. Currently, she is planning to access CrediKiva, the first loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy women's clothing, shoes and bags as she is preparing for mother's day and it

In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Thus there is a need for them, especially for students who need to do their research and papers. She rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy new computer units, spare parts, and accessories needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngelina hopes to give her children a good future and a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance

Ella es una mujer  que tiene 6 hijos en las edades de 26 a 31 a\u00f1os y entre ellos hay dos pares de mellos;  todos ellos son su alegr\u00eda y sue\u00f1a con que cada d\u00eda de su vida prosperen paso a paso.  En sus 16 a\u00f1os de experiencia ha trabajado mucho, inicialmente antes de dedicarse a esta actividad comercial,  trabaj\u00f3 empleada en una familia, pero cuando crecieron sus hijos no quisieron que ella continuara en esta actividad; as\u00ed fue como con el producto de su liquidaci\u00f3n, invirti\u00f3 en prendas que vendi\u00f3 entre sus amigas y con las cuales les fue muy bien y con ellas logr\u00f3 hacer crecer su mercado y logr\u00f3 diversificar su oferta. Sus compras las hace en el centro de la ciudad cuando hay ofertas  importantes, promociones y saldos,  que le salen a un mejor precio. Por eso cuando las vende le gana dinero, sin recargar tanto a sus clientes, que le compran a cr\u00e9dito. En su negocio dos de sus hijos recuperan su cartera, contribuyendo as\u00ed con el desempe\u00f1o del negocio. Sonia tambi\u00e9n tiene otra actividad productiva, pues compra galones de arequipes de 2 a tres veces por semana y los envasa en porciones unitarias en vasos de una onza. Este \u00faltimo negocio ha tenido mucha acogida entre sus clientes, que los compran como golosinas para que sus hijos dispongan de ellas y se deleiten. La familia que Sonia conforma con sus hijos es muy unida, por eso en cada paso que da ella es respaldada; con ellos  comparte gastos y le ayudan en todo. En su venta de arequipe no necesita de activos fijos, pues no maneja inventarios. Como Sonia es una mujer tan cociente de la oportunidad tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de frituras, que traslada a otro barrio donde tiene un punto de ventas,  atendido por uno de sus hijos y estos son ingresos adicionales que tambi\u00e9n recibe. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanc\u00edas variadas en promoci\u00f3n. Su credikiva es una inversi\u00f3n exitosa,  porque le permite tener un dinero disponible para responder a pedidos, ya que  los plazos otorgados a sus clientes,  muchas veces no le facilitan el dar una respuesta oportuna a los nuevos compradores a cr\u00e9dito y esto con su credikiva ser\u00e1 posible.  \n\n","en":"Sonia, 52, sells clothes and underwear and also has a business selling \u201cdulce de leche\u201d or \u201carequipe\u201d [caramel].  She has six children whose ages range between 26 and 31 years; among them is a pair of twins.  All of them are her joy and she dreams that they will make progress step by step every day of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn her 16 years of experience she has worked very hard.  Initially before going into this commercial activity, she worked as a domestic employee for a family but when her children grew up they didn\u2019t want her to continue with this activity so she used the money she got from her severance pay and bought some articles of clothing that she sold among her friends.  She did very well with them and managed to increase her market and to diversify her offer.\r\n\r\nShe does her purchases in the center of the city when there are important sales, promotions and close-out sales that mean better prices.  This way when she sells them she earns money without having to charge her customers who buy on credit so much.  Two of her children help out collecting payment thus contributing to the business\u2019 operation.\r\n\r\nSonia has an additional productive activity because she buys gallons of arequipe twice or three times a week that she repackages in single serving containers of one ounce each.  This last business has been very well received by her customers who buy them as treats for their children to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe family that Sonia forms with her children is very united which is why every step she takes is supported; she shares expenses with them and they help her out in everything.  Her arequipe sales don\u2019t require fixed assets since she keeps no standing inventory.\r\n\r\nBecause Sonia is aware of opportunities, she also sells fried fast food that she takes to a different neighborhood where she has a sales point one of her children tends to and this is additional income she also receives.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she will use to buy assorted merchandise that\u2019s on special promotion.  Her Kiva loan is a successful investment because it allows her to have money on hand to respond to orders because the time frame she offers her customers sometimes prevents her from being able to respond in a timely fashion to new credit customers and with the Kiva loan this will be possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1050656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy

She tells us that her age hasn't been an obstacle to allowing her to set goals for herself and become independent, rather she has taken advantage of her youth to have a bright future.  She currently works as a receptionist in one of her country's state businesses, but her salary is not sufficient to cover her expenses as everything has gone up.  That is why she currently has a business in her own home in the form of renting out two rooms.  This business has generated extra income for her in addition to her salary and the support she receives from her husband.  As this is her first loan cycle, she explains that her reason for taking out this loan is to fit out the rooms she rents with the goal of having them be her main source of income.

It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of the region, being the most important city in the Central Valley of Chile. There is a curious allusion to Talca in Chile, the expression \"Talca, Paris, and London.\" Among the many myths about the matter, some say that it derives from something an English person once said, \"Talca looks like London\" [Spanish \"parece\" 'looks like' and \"Par\u00eds\" 'Paris' sound alike] because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in the winter season, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1050808,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy a

She has a small sewing workshop in her home, where she has been sewing all types of clothing for many years.  What she likes best is making women's clothing, although she also makes shirts and children's clothing.  She works from customers' individual orders and during the back to school season, she makes uniforms for local schools. Se\u00f1ora Rosa works every day from 6:00am until 10:00pm and sometimes even later if she has orders to deliver.  She has been in this business for more than 15 years and almost never has a lack of work.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to purchase fabric, thread, buttons and other sewing materials.  This is Se\u00f1ora Rosa's fifth cycle in the communal bank.  She likes the bank because the members are very united.\r\n \r\nSe\u00f1ora Rosa's dreams are to have a bigger workshop and a store in the town center where she could sell her creations.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":877240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase fabric, thread, buttons and other sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Ana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276646287,"comment":null},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283321366,"comment":null},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287208963,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294335278,"comment":null},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":129.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301391110,"comment":null},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":64.13,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":64.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308150130,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T21:17:45Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":406894,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El  Sr. Carlos es de la ciudad de Santan\u00ed, tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado con la Sra.

She lives in Santo Domingo, which is the fourth most populous city in Ecuador. Its population is growing rapidly, as it has a thriving commercial sector and the largest livestock market in the country. \r\n\r\nThe entire province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas forms part of the mountainous coastal area in the western cordillera. It is known historically as the \"Province of Yumbos\" (a reference to the indigenous people), and the \"Hummingbird Capital.\" It is located in the humid tropical region of Latin America, and is a considered a new province, as it was created in 2007.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda has been selling clothing as a street vendor for three years. She has her own clientele and a route she covers. She wants to invest in a new line of clothing for babies, and in this way satisfy customer demand and acquire new customers.  \r\n\r\nThis is why she has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, the intermediary institution between Mar\u00eda and Kiva, seeking a loan. In spite of the fact that this is her first loan, the evaluation that was done determined that she is a client at low-risk of falling into arrears.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda tells us that lack of working capital is a great obstacle. But now, with this loan she will be able to grow, and in this way obtain greater earnings and improve her quality of life. Her great dream is to be able to finish her post-secondary studies, and we hope that with this loan, she will be closer to her dream.

Her loan request was approved under the guidelines of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo.

","en":"Francisco, 44, lives with his spouse; they have five children whose ages range from 10 to 25 years.  He owns a recycling center that\u2019s been in operation about three years and which arose through his spouse\u2019s initiative and is located in a small town near the city of Barranquilla.  He works there with his spouse and his father-in-law selling copper, aluminum, tin, steel, bronze, cardboard and other types of recyclable materials.  With his sales that are mainly to two important clients in the city he\u2019s able to cover family and operational costs.  He currently has no passives but has some basic fixed assets that are necessary for his business.  His goal for later on is to have a truck of his own to transport the recycled materials but his working capital is insufficient at the moment to reach it.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s currently applying for his first Kiva loan which is also his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that he\u2019ll use to buy recyclables in larger amounts like copper, aluminum, tin, steel, bronze and cardboard to meet customer demand.  Success of the investment rests on the fact that his sale is guaranteed and they will be able to respond to their market in an opportune way because sometimes they fall short of meeting customer demand.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":1051811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

is Teresita, 49, resident of Quezon City, Philippines. She is married to Jaime, a driver, and the mother of three children, all of whom are studying. She keeps herself busy attending to her kids and running a business that will help to sustain their daily expenses. \n\nTeresita operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat only home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to pay for cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Aside from this, she also sells silver accessories and processed meat for additional income.She also operates a jeepney unit. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and also frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nTeresita dreams of a good future for all her children. She wants her business to grow and have more customers. She hopes that her faith in God will continue to grow.

She is married to Santiago, a heavy equipment operator, and she is the mother of their children. By the grace of God, Leonora has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. \n\nLeonora oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have two units of jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying them a boundary (daily quota) each day. Their regular customers are students and employees in the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in boundary every day. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 15,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy spare parts and maintenance of her jeepney units. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nLeonora dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n \n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

years old. She is raising a daughter who attends third grade. For 15 years, Kuljan has been operating a cafe, having started her business with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS). Her formal training as a cook, as well as her hard and persistent work, allow Kuljan to earn 20,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue developing her business, Kuljan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy a refrigerated display unit and to stock up on ingredients. This will allow Kuljan to expand the cafe's menu and to attract new customers. She plans to invest her profits from this loan into further expansion of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":1056331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase a refrigerator and food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T23:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T23:00:11Z","loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kuljan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":30216.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938503,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:59:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30216.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012227,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":30216.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776831,"comment":null},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30216.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-03-28T00:22:09Z","paid_date":"2014-01-18T10:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":398320,"name":"Elvie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a food vending business in the Philippines.

Su experiencia data desde hace 21 a\u00f1os  aproximadamente, cuando aprendi\u00f3 esta actividad de su padre. En su negocio vende gel, talcos, jabones, crema dental y en general productos de aseo personal, a clientes en la ciudad de Santa Marta y en el municipio de Galapa, en unidades de medidas como la docena y por cajas.

He resides in the municipality of Galapa along with his wife and one son who is 11 years old. His experience dates back approximately 21 years, when he learned this business from his father. In his business he sells gels, talcum powder, soaps, toothpaste and personal grooming products in general, to customers in the city of Santa Marta and in the municipality of Galapa, in quantities such as by the dozen and by the box. His market is made up especially of shops and general stores and the occasional housewife, who are constantly placing orders to which Dorian must respond in a timely manner in order to be successful. \r\n\r\nWith the sales from his business, he covers his operating costs and household expenses, leaving a small profit margin which he invests in small quantities of products. However it is not sufficient for him to invest in larger volumes and expand his customer base. Thus he has turned to a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, through which he will purchase soaps, gels and personal grooming products.

Jackline is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has two children who are both currently in school. For the past two years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her retail shop which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more essential commodities for resale and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay some school fees for her children. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a car for herself. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training. The ELA program has improved Jackline's future prospects by helping her learn how to save her

The loan will be used to increase stock in her business and will help Ruth to generate greater profits and for her medical expenses. Ruth hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land. \r\n\r\nRuth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life skills training.

Agness is 22 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fortpotal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past four years, Agness has been working hard to manage her small market, which sells row food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Agness has requested a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more food for resale, and will help Agness to generate greater profits, pay school fees for her children, and add to her business. Agness hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house of her own. \r\n\r\nAgness is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Agness's future prospects by helping her to learn life planning skills.

The family has lived in the community of Canco in the northern part of Colomi of the city of Cochabamba for more than 4 years. \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 His main activity is farming potatoes, beans, oca, and papaliza. He grows his crops on approximately 1 hectare, land he inherited from his parents. This is how he supports his family. Jose tells us that he built his house but it was lacking a wall around it and the money the had saved up wasn't enough. That is why they came to our office in CIDRE IFD to ask for a loan to build a wall around their house. The answer was yes and they are very happy.  \r\n\r\nWhen the wall it built, their house will be safer and they won't have to worry every time they leave the house. Jos\u00e9 tells us that other financial entities denied them the loan since they had a lot of requirements. \r\n\r\nOne of his dreams and goals is to totally finish building their house and for his son to keep going to school until he has a professional degree so that he can have a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1128.18,"image":{"id":1052221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to build a wall around his house.

This area is known for its beautiful beaches, its cuisine and the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Ana Mar\u00eda.  She is 63 years old, married, and has four children who are all now grown up and independent.  Her husband is a shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nMore than ten years ago, in order to earn a living and provide for their family on a daily basis, Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband used a small amount of money they had to set up a small grocery store in their home.  They started out with very little but now, thanks to loans, they have been able to expand the business and, as time has gone by, they have also added school supplies and some homeware products.  Ana Mar\u00eda and her husband work every day, from 6.00am to 8.00pm.  In some seasons their sales increase a lot but in others not so much.  However, all the same, it makes them enough to support themselves.

She is an entrepreneur, a dynamic woman, ambitious, 52 years old, and married. She sells clothing.\n\nShe began her business when she found out about the microcredit that was offered by the MFI, Hekima. Thus, she received her first loan of $50 to start up her business. Her husband is an evangelist pastor serving in a protestant community. The profits from her business go toward savings, food, and the education of her children.\n\nMeanwhile, she has just received her third loan. Since receiving her first loan, her business has grown. So, she decided to increase the amount of her loan for this cycle. She will use this new loan to buy about ten female boubous. Also, she hopes to broaden her horizons and stock up in Kampala, as well as see her children grow up.

This place is known for its beautiful beaches, its wonderful food and the warmth of its people.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where 52 year old Elsa lives.  She is in a common-law marriage, and they have four grown children.  However, the youngest child still lives with her.  Her husband is a fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe has a business of buying and selling \u201cpinchaguas\u201d.  This is a type of fish that is much demand by individuals and by owners of \u201cceviche\u201d (a dish made of raw fresh fish cooked by lots of lemon juice) businesses.  They use her product to prepare delicious \u201cceviche de pinchaguas\u201d, which her customers really enjoy.\r\n\r\nShe buys from the fisherman in Los Arenales.  From there she takes charge of cleaning the fish and marinates them in lemon.  She later delivers them in plastic containers to her customers.  She works every day in the mornings, and she works as much on cleaning as delivering her products.
