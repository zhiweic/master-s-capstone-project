She is 44 years old, married and has two children.  She was unable to receive a higher education since her family has had financial problems since she was just a child.  Shahodat's husband is a migrant worker in Russia since it's difficult to find work in Tajikistan.  She buys and sells household products.  In the beginning, it was difficult because she needed funds.  In 2008, she rented a store at a local market and 5 years later, in 2012, she bought her own store with the money she earned.  Last year, she was advised to turn to Arvand to take out a loan.  With that capital, she expanded her selection of inventory and coincidentally increased her family's income.  She is very glad that she made the decision to use Arvand.  She has big plans for the future and very much wants her children to go to college and does everything in her power to reach this goal.  With this loan, Shahodat again will buy household products to expand her inventory.  She is very grateful to Arvand since with the help of such organizations, those with financial problems can achieve their goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1329418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase

He is engaged in selling quarry stone (stones for home construction) and has been in this business for five years.  He began working as a stone loader at a very young age.  Sometimes, he was a driver and at other times he worked as a salesman and loader at the same time.  But he put his mind to saving to buy a truck with the goal of becoming independent and establishing his own business.  He saved for five years until he was able to buy a used truck that his old boss sold to him.  He has two helpers when he makes the trip to the capital city of Managua to sell quarry stone.  He is pleased to be getting ahead and tries to provide the best he can to his children.  One of the projects he has planned is to install a general store in his home for his wife to manage and in this way, gain another source of income.

Little by little he began to build a domestic clientele made up of family members and friends, and later he attracted other sectors around his house where he makes the product.\r\n\r\nCurrently he needs to buy supplies in bulk to have lower production costs and be more competitive with his prices.

She has two children, ages 7 and 25.  Her business activity is selling various products from specialized guides or catalogs, which she always watches for sales.  She sells on credit.\r\n\r\nWhen she was very young she worked as an employee.

Her goal for later on is to have a place and to achieve growth in her business. \r\n\r\nHowever, her greatest challenge is not having enough working capital to achieve this goal.  That is the reason that she turns to a Kiva loan, her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy clothes, which she will have ready to deliver to her loyal customers.  The season in which the volume of sales increases is approaching.  That is why Nanis needs to have working capital to respond to this demand.\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she bought perfume, creams, and hair care products.  They came in her catalogs with very good discounts.  This was a great opportunity to increase her profits, to have inventory that turned over quickly, and to offer her customers better prices.\r\n\r\nShe is now supporting her son even more with the university expenses.  Her message is one of great gratitude.

With her great desire for improvement she decided to set up a business selling food at home.

Sus ventas as\u00ed como sus compras, las realiza de contado en la comunidad que habita alrededor de su barrio.

","en":"Carlos is 19 years old. He has a small shop selling sodas, drinks, pastries, and also fish and meats. \r\n\r\nCarlos has experience in his family business since he was very small. When his father lost his job, he decided to go work for himself. When he received his severance pay, he invested it in the purchase of freezers and equipment with which he started his business, stocking it little by little. Carlos shares responsibility for manning the shop with his mother from Monday to Sunday from 4:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night. Their sales, as well as their purchases, are done in cash in the community around their neighborhood. \r\n\r\nCarlos's goal for the future is to remodel his business and keep it stocked so that he can continue his education and \"be someone in life,\" as he himself says. He currently needs to put working capital into his business, and that is the reason for taking out a Kiva loan.

She is married and has five children, all of whom are dependent on Nelly as they are at various stages in their education.  Nelly herself completed primary school bu could not continue to secondary school due to a lack of financial help from her parents, who had very little money.  It was Nelly's parents who, from a very young age, taught her agriculture and how to grow basic grains such as rice, corn and beans.  With her husband and her children (after they have finished school), the family go out to clean and shell the crops at a young age.  Nelly does not own the land she works, but rents it.  This leaves her with a lower profit on the final product at every harvest.  She sells her products in the local area and sells more at the weekends.  She takes advantage of the markets and also the area around her home, selling to neighbours and in the adjoining areas.\r\n\r\nNelly is currently applying for help to buy certified seeds in order to grow a little more on the land that she and her husband rent.  She wants to take full advantage of the free space and use it up.\r\n\r\nNelly's goal is, in time, to buy a plot of land that will allow her to grow her crops on her own.  The work is hard and sometimes risky because of natural disasters or plagues the damage the crops, but they still always have to pay rent for the land.  Nelly's dream is to educate her children so that they have a better quality of life, a higher income in the future and so that they do not have to face the same challenges and obstacles she did in her youth, as agricultural work is difficult and tiring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":1331637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

is 56 years old. She lives in the Gardabani district with her 26-year-old son,  her daughter in-law, and two grandchildren. The family earns an income from agricultural activities. They cultivate greens and vegetables on a plot of land and sell their harvested products at local markets to earn a small profit which is rarely enough to feed the family. Giulsanam has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up without any success. Her loan request is always rejected because of her low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGiulsanam is requesting a loan from Credo to purchase a cow and a calf. She will milk the cow to make dairy products to sell at the market and increase her family's daily income.

He is Alimahmad, a 26-year-old man from Tajikistan. He is married to a wonderful woman named Saisoro, and they have 1 child who is 1 year old. For the last 3 years, Alimahmad has been growing such crops as potatoes, wheat, carrots, and so on. He sells his harvest at the market, where his produce is in demand due to its high quality.

Jaba has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for his family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected every time due to his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nJaba is a tinsmith worker. He fixes damaged cars (repairing the car body) on private orders and earns a small monthly salary. His family also has a milk cow and owns a vineyard. They use the cow for milk to make cheese. With the harvested grapes, Jaba makes vodka, which is sold together with the cheese locally at the markets. \r\n\r\nJaba has requested a loan from Credo to start-up his family business. His loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credits with soft conditions to the country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the received credit Jaba will purchase an old damaged car. He already has some savings and needs this loan to add to the amount that he has. After buying a damaged car he will fix it himself and then sell it at a higher price. As he is already experienced in this field Jaba hopes he will earn a good profit to reinvest in the same business and buy more cars. This will significantly increase the family income and he will be able to provide better living conditions for them. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":390.18,"image":{"id":1330489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase an old damaged car, fix it and sell it at a higher price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kveda Sazano","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T14:20:06Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84.8},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":87.72},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":89.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":92.47},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.28},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.86},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.15},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.79},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.28,"local_amount":61.24,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":63.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372969150,"comment":null},{"amount":45.86,"local_amount":73.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381749568,"comment":null},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":76.35,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":78.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390613476,"comment":null},{"amount":48.61,"local_amount":77.77,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857195,"comment":null},{"amount":50.02,"local_amount":80.04,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410133847,"comment":null},{"amount":51.86,"local_amount":82.97,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107435,"comment":null},{"amount":53,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430254987,"comment":null},{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":87.72,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":90.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019141,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-16T03:45:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":547524,"name":"Febronia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Febronia is a married woman with one child aged eight years.

","en":"Saymurod is an intelligent and hard-working man. He is 22 years old, single, and lives with his parents. He has an older brother with whose help he started his own retail business 2 years ago. He has his own shop in the city center where he sells household goods. Every day he gets up at dawn and goes to work in the early morning with the goal of making the day a successful one and having a lot of customers come to his store. Sometimes he makes a lot of sales, and sometimes he doesn't. Because his shop is downtown, he has a lot of competition.

is a 25 year old housewife. She lives in Rawalpindi, Pakistan along her husband and two children. Both of her children are studying in school. Her husband has been successfully operating a tailoring business for three years.\r\n\r\nSidra has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan. The main purpose of the loan is so that her husband can expand his business. There are currently two workers in her husband\u2019s tailoring business. He wants to hire two more workers so that his production capacity will increase. For that purpose he requires two more new sewing machines and this loan would be used to purchase those new sewing machines.\r\n\r\nSidra is very hopeful that after getting this loan, her husband\u2019s business would flourish. She is currently living in a rented house and desires to have her own house. She is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan.

Patricia lives in the locality of Tiquipaya where basic services and water are scarce. The majority of the time, water is bought from the water wagons that offer water in each area for a modest price. Therefore, she is requesting this loan to construct a bathroom with a water tank, in order to be able to have a water reserve, since one of the principal reasons for the construction of a water tank is to store and distribute the water along with the construction of water pipes that lead to the bathroom, shower and kitchen. This is of great utility, since the water wagons come by once a week and her family is often without water and this basic element is essential in every home.

is 26 years old and lives in the town of Mityana in the Mubende region of Uganda. He is married and has one child. For the past year, Adam has been working hard to manage his retail shop, which sells soap, sugar, milk and bread. To help expand his business, Adam has applied for a loan of 3,000,000 Ugandan Shillings (UGX) from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more items, such as rice, maize flour and soda, to sell, and it will help Adam to generate greater profits and enable him to sell more goods, due to his increased stock. His profits will increase, and he will pay his medical bills. Adam hopes that, in the future, he will be able to expand his shop into a mini supermarket. Adam is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs such as Adam, who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but who have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":990.58,"image":{"id":1330627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more items, such as rice, maize flour and soda, to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mityana","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.4175 32.022778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2013-04-14T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-05-14T21:20:03Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":204143},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":211516},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":219156},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":227072},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":235273},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":243771},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":252576},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":261699},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":271151},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":280945},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":291092},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":301606}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.84},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.15},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.48},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.2},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.01},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":204143,"processed_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-22T08:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":205821.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364880377,"comment":null},{"amount":82.84,"local_amount":211516,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-21T08:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":213255.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372886120,"comment":null},{"amount":85.84,"local_amount":219156,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-24T08:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":220958.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381908551,"comment":null},{"amount":88.93,"local_amount":227072,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":228939.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":391396881,"comment":null},{"amount":92.15,"local_amount":235273,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T08:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":237207.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399776423,"comment":null},{"amount":95.48,"local_amount":243771,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-28T08:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":245775.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411560677,"comment":null},{"amount":98.92,"local_amount":252576,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-23T09:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":254653.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420923602,"comment":null},{"amount":366.46,"local_amount":935634,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":943328.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429470222,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-04-24T12:49:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":547623,"name":"Mwaka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwaka is a married woman.

She is the daughter of an entrepreneurial couple, she is happy, and with much faith in God. Andrea is the second daughter from this happy marriage. She had a happy childhood and did very well in high school. This couple has been together for 24 years, and this has shown that love will always triumph. At 18 years old, she values her parents very much, and also the hard work and morals they have taught her, and also the good example they have provided. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago she finished her high school degree. She graduated with honors and it was a very good experience. She has wonderful memories of each of her friends. She has left her mark on the lives of many people. Her charisma and the fact she is a good person have made an impression on her teachers. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing high school, she didn\u2019t have the resources to attend university. However, her mother, through a lot of hard work and dedication, was able to provide her with a few English classes, which she was very successful in. After that, she made the decision to start working during the December holidays. Things went very well for her, but for reasons that are not relevant here, she became unemployed. With the support of her family, she has decided to become a student again. She took a look at the situation in which she finds herself. Nineteen years ago, her father developed diabetes, which has caused degeneration of his body, and because of this he lost his sight.

","en":"Nigina is a hard working and intelligent woman. She is 29 years old, married, and has a child. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia who sends money home. Nigina also works, as she has been a dressmaker for over six years. She works out of her home, sewing traditional dresses for women and children. She also sews curtains to order for houses and offices. She tries to please her clients with high quality tailoring of the clothes and curtains she makes. The money her husband sends is not enough to provide the family with everything it needs, so Nigina needs to expand her business and earn a higher income. She needs a new sewing machine, and also fabric for making more of the traditional dresses. She is asking for a 5000 TJS loan to buy a sewing machine and fabric. She promises that as an honest person, she will repay the loan on time. She appreciates your kindness.

","en":"Ortikjon is a hardworking and conscientious woman. Her family is amicable so all the problems that come up in the family are easy to solve. Ortikjon is married and has four children. Her husband is a teacher at the town's middle school. Her children are grown, have their own work and help Ortikjon run the business. The youngest son teaches at the university. Ortikjon and her children have been raising animals and raising crops such as corn, barley, and other grains, for over 10 years. A few years ago two of her sons married, and after the weddings they were left without animals since they sold everything to pay for the wedding festivities. It was very hard to live without milk, kefir, and butter. But the family addressed the hardship with the help of a loan. This year they bought two more hectares of land, and now own a total of six hectares. Ortikjon and her children want to plant on all six hectares. She is asking for a 5000 TJS loan for the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. She appreciates your kindness.

rural areas surrounded by the waters of the Atlantic ocean. Many of the members are selling goods like clothing, shoes or cosmetics. Others sell seafood, run fried food stalls and other businesses. \r\n\r\nMarcelina is a married woman and a mother of eight children, five of whom live together with her and their father. She said that her most difficult challenge has been to built her house, which she started and still needs to finish.

Now the skills that she gained and her father's lessons have become Gavharoi's main source of income. Additionally, she works on a dehkan farm, where she gets her family's daily vegetables, greens, and fruit. Hence, her animal husbandry work has been bringing in her family's \"daily bread\" for 30 years. Due to time constraints associated with her finances, Gavharoi decided to turn to a loan.

","en":"Nazira is a hard-working woman, who lives in the northern Tajikistan mountains. She grew up in a rural area and has worked tirelessly since childhood. She wasn't able to get a university education. Hence, she was left without a trade. \r\n\r\nAfter marrying, Nazira's life became very difficult. She had children and her husband had a very small salary. Some days there was nothing for her and her children to eat. \r\n\r\nThen, she found out about a course called \"Bring It On\", organized by the Business Women's Association. She got a certificate from the course and now has the skills to work in business. She is planning to start her own animal trade business. She is requesting a loan of 1500 American dollars to purchase cattle. She sincerely needs your help and is waiting on your kindness!

","en":"Shahlo is a humble, hard-working, and determined woman. She was born in a rural area and has significant experience in animal husbandry and crop farming. She had a difficult childhood because her father never had permanent work. \r\n\r\nShahlo's husband went to Russia to find work and she works as a cleaning lady in a school. Additionally, she started working in animal husbandry five months ago. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of improving her skill set, Shahlo took the course \"Bring It On\", led by the Business Women's Association and IMON International. She learned many interesting things including how to make her own business plan. However, her family currently has financial problems. \r\n\r\nShahlo is planning for her daughter to go to university, but she doesn't have enough money. She has to earn the money for her daughter's education and still support her family. She is requesting a 5000 som loan for purchasing cattle to start her new business. She is waiting on your kindness!

the age of 24, John\u2019s successful retail clothing store had grown from just one location to 22 in only three years time. With the success came the pressure to sustain a certain lifestyle. This inadvertently led to his role in an insurance fraud scheme that resulted in a 25-years-to-life sentence. \r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s second chance came after working directly with the CROP (Convicts Reaching Out to People) program in his prison. This program brought teenagers in from alternative and delinquent schools to hear the stories of convicts and how their decisions as teenagers ultimately led to their incarcerations. Teachers and administrators were deeply impressed with John, in particular, and saw how his words drastically affected the students.  Many students wrote letters to John to thank him for turning their lives around.\r\n\r\nWhen John had worked for five years with the CROP program, teachers and administrators traveled from San Diego to San Francisco to lead a campaign to release him from prison. After 20 years of incarceration, John was released into society on March 23, 2012. With just $600, John started his new life and career as a motivational speaker and author.\r\n\r\nToday John travels through San Diego speaking at schools and counseling troubled youth. He is also the author of three books, including \"The Dirty Nasty Truth: 18 True Crime Stories & 10 Life in Prison Stories to Stop Juvenile Delinquency.\" He hopes that, through his commitment to reaching out to juvenile delinquents, he can stop the cycle of crime and help them discover their goals and dreams.\r\n\r\nA loan through Kiva will enable John to purchase more books to be sent to schools. His new book will be a resource that can be given to students that don\u2019t have the opportunity to see him speak. With your help, John can reach students through San Diego and the nation.\r\n\r\nFor more information on John and his work as a speaker and author, visit

parents, Rob and Betty, were getting tired and older and couldn't agree: Do we expand or drop the 7-year-old catering business, R&B Kitchens? Weary of working as a cook at other restaurants, Robert seized the opportunity and took charge of the family business.\r\n  \r\nIn addition to his mother\u2019s teaching, Robert had honed his skills by attending culinary school. As a former chef for different restaurants, Robert said he wanted to be in charge and create food his way, but he always deferred to the head chefs, so he didn\u2019t have the freedom he sought. So, his taking over the family business was a win for both his parents and Robert.\r\n \r\nNow in charge of the El Paso business, R&B Kitchens, Robert says his plan is to expand the catering business by adding soul food to the Cajun menu, as well as adding a restaurant. His mother, whom he credits as the foundation for the family\u2019s cooking talents, will cook alongside his father and sister at the restaurant.\r\n \r\nWhile out shopping for restaurant equipment, Robert ran into an Accion Texas Inc. loan officer, who invited him to her office. After getting approved, Robert used his loan to buy supplies, as well as tables, chairs and shelves to remodel an older restaurant. Robert says with the loan, he was able to replace old wall tiles and repair mirrors.\r\n \r\nHad he not received his Accion loan, Robert said he and his family would have had to have waited at least another month to open, since all they had to invest in the new restaurant was $500.\r\n \r\nWithin the next four months, Robert plans to hire more employees and establish a

He is 44 years old. He is married to a wonderful woman named Khosiyat, and they have 4 children. Isroil and his family live in a remote area where the main source of income is animal husbandry and growing agricultural crops. For the last 20 years, he and his brothers Ismoil and Elior have been earning their living by raising cattle and growing crops. Isroil grows wheat, corn, and so on. His wife and two of his sons help him with his work. They sell their rich harvest to local citizens and also take it to the central market of the region to be sold.
