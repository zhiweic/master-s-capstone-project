Susanna has a small and well-run farm. She keeps two cows, two bulls, two piglets, 12 sheep and 25 chickens. As a result of working night and day, Susanna manages to sell some meat, dairy products and eggs, right from her house to her loyal customers and neighbors. A plot of land that she owns also brings a little income to her family; from her fruit garden she manages to sell apples and apricots.\r\n\r\nSusanna and her family live in the village Ddmashen, which is in the Gegharkunik area. Susanna\u2019s husband is in the Russian Federation working abroad. From time to time, he helps his family financially. Nonetheless, the couple has not been able to save enough money to care for the needs of their three children and, at the same time, to cover the upkeep of their farm. Among numerous maintenance problems in her farm, Susanna wants to solve the one that is the most urgent now -- she wants to repair the barn for her farm animals. To do this, she needs 800.000 Armenian drams of loan capital, and she also will buy some animal fodder. She thanks beforehand her Kiva lenders, and she anticipates your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":489.61,"image":{"id":1374130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Isatu says that during the rainy season purchasing power is very slow.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to buy more soap, milk, pure water and biscuits. The extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business. In the future, she plans to open a big shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":98.91,"image":{"id":1374162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

He has a store where he sells basic consumer goods such as: beans, milk, bread, and other items.  He's had this business for 4 years, and this has given him a lot of experience in sales that allows him to get better earnings.

The area enjoys green fields and a church that professes the religion of its population.  The people also maintain the culture and traditions of their ancestors.  Their sources of income are agriculture, raising animals, commerce, and many go to the city every day to work in different professions.  All of the kinds of work that they do give them the opportunity to improve the stability of their households so that they can provide their children with a better future.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Jenny, who has been a member for six years.  She is 26 years old, married, and has no children.  Her husband works as a public employee.  She does not have her own home because she lives with her in-laws, with whom they share the household expenses.\r\n\r\nJenny has had her own business for five years.  It is a copy center where she also covers theses, sells stationary items, and sells candy.  She works at her business from Monday to Saturday from 8:00am until 10:00pm.  In her home, she works raising and selling guinea pigs.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the money from the loan to purchase a printer.  Her goal is to finish building her home.\r\n\r\nThe small photos are of two group members who were not able to be present when they took the group photo.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5025,"image":{"id":1375416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a printer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2013-06-23T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-23T22:10:08Z","loan_amount":5025,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Del Cisne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Narcisa Milena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5019.92,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":418.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":418.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.76},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.76},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.75},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.76},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1256.26,"local_amount":1254.99,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390566704,"comment":null},{"amount":837.51,"local_amount":836.66,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":837.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399815722,"comment":null},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":836.66,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T08:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410965933,"comment":null},{"amount":837.51,"local_amount":836.66,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":837.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419857677,"comment":null},{"amount":837.51,"local_amount":836.66,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":837.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429506084,"comment":null},{"amount":418.71,"local_amount":418.29,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":418.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439729882,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-21T10:44:50Z","paid_date":"2014-01-17T12:08:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573851,"name":"Maa Kamudei Self Help Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabita is 33 years old, married and has one child.

year old man. He is married and has five children. Vallami lives with his family in a small town. He loves nature and animals, so his line of work suits him. Vallami practices animal husbandry. He raises the animals and sells them. This business earns him a stable income. His wife works at home as a seamstress, and in her free time she helps her husband care for the animals. Vallami's children are grown, have their own children, and live far away. Vallami also has additional income because he has a hardware store where he sells building materials to locals. Vallami's beloved grandson is growing up fast and will soon need to go to a university for a higher education. With that in mind, Vallami wants to expand his business to earn more income to help with his son's education. He contacted Arvand and would like to obtain a loan to buy a few head of cattle. Vallami hopes for a positive response and thanks Arvand ahead of time for the financial support. \r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1371047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

He has 2 children and has been doing this work for 4 years. His primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nHe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Farming maize'. His biggest challenge is 'lack of capital.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Dhiang.'\r\n\r\nThomas was asked why he chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which he replied: 'It offers financing to farmers.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'They gives loans to small-scale farmers.'\r\n\r\nHis highest monthly expense is farming costs. When asked 'How will this loan benefit his family', Thomas replied 'Increased family income.'\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated.

Thanks to her stubborn labor, Cholpongul currently has one cow with offspring, a horse, and 1.85 hectares of leased land. The sale of milk and dairy products provides her with an income of about 5000 somons per month.  In order to further grow her business, Cholpongul has turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to ask for a loan of 60,000 somons in order to increase the amount of livestock by purchasing a cash cow and fertilizer for the land.

The community has been working with Planting Empowerment for more than six years to manage their land more sustainably and profitably. They will use the $8,000 loan to buy plantain seed stock and pay for their planting, maintenance, and harvest. With the proceeds from the plantain harvests they will finance community development projects and support legal efforts to secure their reservation.\n\nLiriano lives with his wife and daughter in Arimae, and is part of one of the founding families of the community. He has been working for Planting Empowerment since the company formed, and currently manages the day-to-day maintenance of 25 hectares of agroforestry projects. He is currently studying to receive his professional Forester's degree from the University of Panama in the Darien. Liriano expects to become Planting Empowerment\u2019s Head Forester when he finishes school. \n\nThe residents of Arimae are ancestors of the Choc\u00f3 people who migrated from the Choc\u00f3 region of Colombia during the 16th century, and subsisted for generations as hunter-gatherers and fishermen. Today, the community members depend mostly on subsistence agriculture and day labor to put food on the table. Arimae is part of a network of indigenous reservations that once stretched for hundreds of thousands of hectares in the Darien. Over the past 30 years however, their land holdings have declined sharply as illegal logger and cattle ranchers encroach into their reservation in search of timber and pastureland.

","en":"Badriddin is a joyful 34-year-old man. He is married but does not yet have children. He and his wife live in a small house in a rural village. Not having had children yet, they have not lost heart, but continue to hope and wait. In order to have a steady income, Badriddin engages in his business. For more than 3 years, he and his wife have been growing potatoes. Badriddin himself was born into a farming family, and, because of this, he has great experience in this business, since he has been helping his father work the field from childhood. Each year during the season, he receives a good harvest, which he then sells at the market and receives a stable income.  Badriddin uses the income from his business to spend on food and necessities for his family. However, he wants to bring his home to a better condition, and he needs money in order to do this. So, he has been dreaming of becoming a bigger-scale farmer and wants to expand his business and increase the size of his harvest.

Her mother was the one who prompted her to open the store and helped her get the premises where it operates.  The space does not only function as the workshop where she makes the clothing that she designs, but also as a store where it is exhibited.  She applies the separation plan, which is to pay before taking the product home, which her customers like very much, and she also accepts cash.  She purchases from fabric and accessories vendors over a large area since they offer the best prices.  This is how she can adjust her costs to the needs of her customers.  \r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting her first loan from Kiva with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo so that she can purchase an industrial sewing machine.  This will improve her production times and increase the quality of her products.  Her goal in the future is to have her own brand and consolidate with the best collections, designed by her.  Meanwhile, her greatest challenge is to succeed in substantially increasing sales and increase her production to have savings.

Each one is doing a survey to eliminate poverty, which allows them to understand the situation of each woman, of whom 9 are below the poverty line, which is to say, very low income. For this reason, these women are working twice as hard to improve.\r\n\r\nOne of these woman is Maria, who is a tailor. She has earned her living doing this for a while, and is creating very good customers for herself. Her work is always of good quality, and her customers like this. She wants to continue growing and thus help her family.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy fabric, thread, rubber and more, to be able to continue with her work and meet customer orders. She is grateful for this growth opportunity that she and her family are receiving.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":1375018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy

In this way, she and her family will have more security and wellbeing and she will continue working and striving to achieve her great dream of seeing her little ones become good professionals. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":435.7,"image":{"id":1375464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to make improvements to her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Camana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":146.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":159.59},{"due_date":"2013-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":162.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":168.46},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":178.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":181.94},{"due_date":"2013-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":191.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":196.47},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":204.12},{"due_date":"2014-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":217.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":220.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":230.34},{"due_date":"2014-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":238.05},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":247.95},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":256.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.51},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.84},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.73},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.86},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.28},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.23,"local_amount":306.09,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-21T08:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":308.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390776289,"comment":null},{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":162.16,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":163.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399779322,"comment":null},{"amount":61.77,"local_amount":168.46,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":169.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410054514,"comment":null},{"amount":65.28,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T12:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":179.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419819417,"comment":null},{"amount":66.71,"local_amount":181.94,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T13:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":183.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429472369,"comment":null},{"amount":70.25,"local_amount":191.58,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T11:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":192.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439694856,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-07-23T21:34:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":573966,"name":"Hong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hong is a 46-year-old married woman who lives with two children and her husband in Ho Chi Minh City.

primaria y luego ayudar en los quehaceres del hogar y del campo junto  a sus padres. Se cas\u00f3 muy joven con Efren  que actualmente tiene 57 a\u00f1os y se dedica a la agricultura, con \u00e9l sali\u00f3 de la ciudad en la que creci\u00f3; para ir a una zona con clima c\u00e1lido donde nacieron sus 6 hijos; 5 de los cuales son independientes, trabajan y tienen su familia, el hijo menor est\u00e1 a punto de terminar la escuela primaria y Rosa vive con \u00e9l y su esposo en R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una ciudad que cuenta un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Sus varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nRosa con el objetivo de aportar en los gastos del hogar, desde hace 7 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 con el negocio de crianza de pollos para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n, actividad que la aprendi\u00f3 de uno de sus parientes quien comparti\u00f3 todos los conocimientos del negocio para que Rosa tambi\u00e9n lo pusiera en pr\u00e1ctica. Rosa invierte todas las ma\u00f1anas en el aseo, alimentaci\u00f3n y cuidado de los pollos y a veces alg\u00fan tiempo en las tardes, paralelamente a esto, ella realiza los quehaceres del hogar para no despreocuparse de las necesidades de su esposo e hijo. Rosa firma que para este negocio siempre es necesario proveerse de capital para comprar \u201cbalanceado\u201d que es el alimento especial que se da a las aves y adem\u00e1s para comprar pollos beb\u00e9 para criarlos y luego venderlos; es por esto que por cuarto a\u00f1o consecutivo, ella ha solicitado un pr\u00e9stamo que lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de algunos pollos adicionales y adem\u00e1s balanceado al por mayor para tener la provisi\u00f3n de alimento necesaria para los pollos que tiene y los que vendr\u00e1n. Rosa ha sido una cliente puntual en sus cuotas y ha continuado trabajando con Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa porque el trato que recibe en la oficina y de su ejecutivo de cuenta es motivador. Rosa agradece  a todas las personas alrededor dl mundo que a\u00fan sin conocerla deciden confiar en ella y su microempresa. ","en":"Rosa is 61 years old.  She grew up in a household with limited resources, so she was only able to attend school through primary school and later helped her parents with the household chores and in the fields.  She got married very young to Efren, who is 57 years old and works as a farmer.  With him, she left the city where she was born to go to an area with a warm climate where their six children were born.  Five of them are now independent and have their own families and the youngest is about to finish primary school.  Rosa lives with him and her husband in Rio Verde in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas province.  The city has a significant amount of trade since it has become a land port for exchange between the mountain and coastal regions of the country.  Its various tourist attractions, in addition to its warm climate, are frequented by national and international tourists.  The majority of the inhabitants have learned a commercial trade or provide services to the locals and tourists.\r\n\r\nSeven years ago, with the objective of helping with the household expenses, Rosa started a business raising chickens for later sale.  She learned this work from one of her relatives who shared their knowledge of the business so that Rosa could also put it into practice.  Rosa spends her mornings and sometimes afternoons cleaning, feeding, and caring for the chickens.  At the same time, she does the household chores so that she does not have to worry about the needs of her husband and son.  \r\n\r\nRosa says that for her business it is always necessary to have capital to purchase \"balanceado\", which is the special feed that is given to poultry, as well as chicks to raise them and later sell.

She is a resident of Kigyende, a suburb in Isingiro district. She married at 18 to a man she loved. But later, the husband deserted his family and moved to Tanzania. Unfortunately the family had no income-generating business except for a small banana plantation which was the source of food for the family.

The women average 50 years of age and seven children each. They know one another through ties of community and their revenue-generating businesses at the Djalakorodji market. The group members have small-scale businesses selling juice drinks made from hibiscus flowers or ginger, as well as selling condiments (Magie bouillon cubes, garlic, 'soumbala', \u2026) With the goal of increasing their working capital, the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Sitan, who is the woman sitting at the far left in the photo, is a major vendor of local juice drinks. She intends to use her loan to purchase a bag of sugar, 100 kg of ginger, 100 kg of hibiscus flowers, and some flavorings.

is Mai from Liberia. She resides in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County. The county is located by the sea and is known for their beaches and fish. In addition, many logging companies are also located in the city. People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce.\r\n\r\nMai is 51 and married with three children. Her children are between the ages of 35 and 11. Only one is currently living at home and only two are in school. \r\n\r\nMai has owned her own small local shop business selling fashion clothes for the past 20 years. She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more fashion clothes for her business.\r\n\r\nOn average, she works 10 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with small money from her fianc\u00e9e. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money.

Group members are small retail merchants of charcoal, clothing, smoked fish from Mopti, fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nTo increase their working capital, the group decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first group loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMrs. Massan (the woman sitting on the far right) is a big seller of fruit and vegetables of all kinds at the Banconi-Farada market . She plans to use the loan to buy a cartload of mangoes and pineapples.\r\n\r\nShe gets her fruit supplies from the markets in Bamako. Retail sales are conducted at the market, for cash, to a clientele composed mostly of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Massan hope to achieve with this loan an average monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in the business and to provide for her family's needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1375728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"buy fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Banconi-Farada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massan              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T11:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381819727,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390678675,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T17:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399924286,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T19:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410207475,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419972144,"comment":null},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":67968.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429624747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-26T09:18:36Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T22:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574166,"name":"Hay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hay, a 49-year-old married woman, lives in Ho Chi Minh City.

She was born and grew up in Kanibadam. She got married early, and she has two children, but after giving birth to the second one her husband left them for another woman. Firuza was very lonely and she decided to go to her parent's house. But she was not happy there either, as her mother died long time ago and her father is very old, and living together with him was hard. Firuza's brother lives with his own family, and they also barely survive and he is not able to help his sister. \r\n\r\nFiruza decided to earn money for living herself and with the last money she had she bought a goby, She started to take care of it and when he grew some, she sold him at a good price and bought two small calves. This way she started growing her business. Now she has been breeding cattle for more than two years. She already has more than five heads of cattle due to this. \r\n\r\nFiruza is very happy with her business as it gives her a good income. After having saved money, she plans to purchase her own house in the future, and live with her children, not dependent on anyone. Currently Firuza would like to purchase more cattle, but she needs financial means. At the advice of an acquaintance, she decided to submit an application for a loan and turned to the organization \"Arvand\". She hopes very much for financial support.\r\n  "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":347.33,"image":{"id":1372879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kanibadam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.283333 70.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T08:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T08:00:12Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feruza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":206.75},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":213.76},{"due_date":"2013-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":221.01},{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":228.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":236.24},{"due_date":"2013-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":244.25},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":252.53},{"due_date":"2014-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":261.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":269.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":279.09},{"due_date":"2014-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":288.56},{"due_date":"2014-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":298.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.56},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.52},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.8,"local_amount":206.75,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-22T08:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":213.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752046,"comment":null},{"amount":46.31,"local_amount":213.76,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-22T08:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":220.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390616143,"comment":null},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":221.01,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399860013,"comment":null},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":228.5,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-21T09:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":235.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136758,"comment":null},{"amount":51.19,"local_amount":236.24,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":243.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900953,"comment":null},{"amount":52.92,"local_amount":244.25,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":252.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550135,"comment":null},{"amount":54.72,"local_amount":252.53,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T13:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":260.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439774356,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:23:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575144,"name":"Alirio Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alirio tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, y se visiona como un gran empresario.

Actualmente vive con sus 2 hijos en la Parroquia de R\u00edo Verde de Santo Domingo, la capital de la Provincia de Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, una provincia de Ecuador que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido un alto crecimiento sostenido. Su capital  es una ciudad en donde lo m\u00e1s atractivo y llamativo son sus deliciosas frutas, y la gastronom\u00eda que ofrecen en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un comercio considerable  ya que se ha convertido en un puerto terrestre de intercambio comercial entre las regiones Sierra y Costa del pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con varios atractivos tur\u00edsticos que acompa\u00f1ados de su clima c\u00e1lido son muy concurridos por turistas nacionales y extranjeros. Es por esto que la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes han emprendido con alguna actividad comercial o de servicios para habitantes y turistas.\nGracias al consejo de una amiga, Esnilda emprendi\u00f3 con la compra \u2013 venta de libros nuevos y usados que los distribuye en las zonas rurales donde hay escasez de librer\u00edas que fomenten la cultura y educaci\u00f3n de los ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes. Esnilda trabaja todos los d\u00edas en un horario de 8 horas y lo hace recorriendo las calles de su ciudad comprando los libros que las personas de la ciudad ya no usan pero que podr\u00edan utilizarlos en otros lugares, tambi\u00e9n va a los almacenes que le proveen de libros nuevos que le piden sus clientes de las zonas que visita. Es un trabajo que le gusta mucho realizar pues ella tambi\u00e9n hace uso de los libros para aprender cosas nuevas. En la actualidad y por el mejoramiento de la educaci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 dando en todas las zonas, hay una demanda considerable de libros de motivaci\u00f3n y liderazgo por lo que Esnilda requiere un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de estos libros para llevar a sus clientes que los solicitan y tambi\u00e9n motivar a todos sus clientes a leer este tipo de libros que pueden ser de mucha ayuda. Con este incremento en la variedad de sus productos, Esnilda est\u00e1 segura que obtendr\u00e1 utilidades adicionales adem\u00e1s de la satisfacci\u00f3n de poder ayudar a las personas a tener un crecimiento personal asegurado. \nEsnilda sue\u00f1a con poder proveer a sus hijos siempre una educaci\u00f3n de calidad hasta verlos convertidos en profesionales de excelencia y que sean un aporte positivo para el pa\u00eds. Ha realizado un par de cr\u00e9ditos anteriormente y sus cuotas siempre han sido puntuales adem\u00e1s que ha asistido a una de las capacitaciones que Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa ha prestado a sus clientes y le pareci\u00f3 muy valioso para ponerlo en pr\u00e1ctica. Gracias a esta Fundaci\u00f3n, Esnilda ha podido capitalizar su negocio y ha recibido de ellos un trato agradable que no  encontr\u00f3 en otras instituciones financieras. ","en":"Esnilda, a woman of 44 years, is a courageous single mother who assumed the responsibility of educating her children and getting them ahead in life. They are now finishing with primary school and preparing for secondary school, in spite of the fact that Esnilda only received a primary education. She has always been willing to work and provide for her family.\r\n\r\nShe currently lives with her two children in the R\u00edo Verde Parrish of Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo is the capital of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, a province of Ecuador which has sustained high growth over the past number of years. The most attractive and interesting feature of Santo Domingo city is its delicious fruit and the local gastronomy. The level of business carried out here is also considerable as it has become an inland hub for commercial activity between the country\u2019s mountain and coastal regions. Furthermore, its many tourist attractions and warm climate make it a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists. For this reason, most of the city\u2019s inhabitants are involved in some form of commercial activity or service for local residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nThanks to the advice of a friend, Esnilda began buying and selling new and used books that she distributes in rural areas where there is a scarcity of book stores that might encourage culture and the education of children and young people. Esnilda works 8 hours every day, going through the streets of her city buying books that the people of the city don\u2019t want anymore, but that could be used in other places. She also visits warehouses to get books that her customers have requested. She enjoys the work a lot and also uses the books to learn new things. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is considerable demand for motivational and leadership books to improve the education that is being given in all the areas. Esnilda needs a loan to purchase these books to bring out to the customers that have requested them, and also to motivate all her customers to read this genre of books that can be very helpful. With the increase in variety of books, Esnilda is certain that she will enjoy additional profits as well as the satisfaction of helping her customers grow personally. \r\n\r\nEsnilda\u2019s dream is to provide her children with a good education until she can see them become excellent professionals and positive members of the country. \r\n\r\nShe has taken out a couple of loans before and her payments have always been on time. She has also attended one of the trainings that the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa puts on for its customers. She has been very brave in putting the training into practice. Thanks to the foundation, Esnilda has not only been able to capitalize her business, but has also enjoyed good treatment by the foundation, something she has not encountered in other financial institutions. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":523.61,"image":{"id":1375412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase wholesale books on motivation ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esnilda Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1116.18,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.91},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84.8},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.63},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":89.1},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.84},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":94.36},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.39},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99.31},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100.6},{"due_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":102.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.47},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.8},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.13},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.11},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.15},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.09},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.4},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":74.49,"local_amount":73.91,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":74.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390565421,"comment":null},{"amount":85.47,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T12:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399814458,"comment":null},{"amount":87.32,"local_amount":86.63,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T08:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":87.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410320632,"comment":null},{"amount":92.11,"local_amount":91.39,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T15:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":92.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419856321,"comment":null},{"amount":90.34,"local_amount":89.63,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":90.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430059897,"comment":null},{"amount":93.88,"local_amount":93.14,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":93.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439995234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-29T17:33:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":575163,"name":"Alfonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alfonso es un campesino de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, dedicado a las labores agr\u00edcolas desde su juventud.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, crops, and personal business.\r\n\r\nShe stated that milking her cows is her favorite activity on the her farm. Her biggest challenge is feeding her cow. An animal on the farm has been given the names of Cheboit.\r\n\r\nRuth was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: \"credit management.\"  During Juhudi's required micro-finance training session, she learned that the organization has agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is farming costs. She said that the loan will help her family by helping her generate profit to pay school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nAs part of Juhudi's loan appraisal process, each borrower's assets are evaluated. Ruth owns a cow and some poultry, but does not own a pig, a pump, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or an automobile. Juhudi Kilimo also tries to measure any change in living standards based on this loan. This borrower has a mosquito net and a TV in her house, but does not have electricity, solar power, running water, a sewing machine, or a DVD player.\r\n\r\nNote: To create this loan profile, Juhudi Kilimo used a mobile device to gather information in the field and send the data to a central online repository, thus reducing paper use, making the process more efficient, and keeping costs down."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300.44,"image":{"id":1374705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2646.04},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2716.04},{"due_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2788.04},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2861.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2937.04},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3015.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3094.04},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.04},{"due_date":"2014-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3260.04},{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3346.04},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3435.04},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3526.04},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3619.04},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3714.04},{"due_date":"2014-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3813.04},{"due_date":"2014-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3913.04},{"due_date":"2014-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4017.04},{"due_date":"2014-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4123.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.49},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.39},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.39},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.51},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.73},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":33.4,"local_amount":2764,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2861.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381960598,"comment":null},{"amount":33.07,"local_amount":2737.06,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T10:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2833.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390820277,"comment":null},{"amount":33.95,"local_amount":2809.41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-20T08:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400417364,"comment":null},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":5742.25,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5944.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419880907,"comment":null},{"amount":109.78,"local_amount":9085.46,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9406.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429529525,"comment":null},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":1725.62,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1786.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439753431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-06-24T18:42:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574228,"name":"Abida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abida, who lives in Lahore, Pakistan, is a responsible mother of five children.

Its four members are all women belonging to Balangir town of Odisha, India. \r\n\r\nAmong the four members, one of the group members is Padmini. The lady sitting in extreme right raising her hand is Padmini. She is 45 years old and lives with her husband, two sons, two daughters, daughter in-law and two grandchildren. \r\n\r\nPadmini is running a multifarious business with the help of her husband and sons. Her son is running a snacks, sweets, gram, popcorn making\/processing and supply business at her house. He also supplies dry foods like biscuits, chocolate, chips etc., to the traders of the town on a daily basis. Apart from this, he also covers 50 shops outside the town. Her husband takes order of assembling CFL (compact florescent light) bulbs from electrical goods wholesellers. She has also a tailoring machine for stitching ladies' garments. Padmini initially started her business in a low profile with two or three items. With the support from Mahashakti foundation, the business slowly expanded in to many activities. \r\n\r\nHer families spends almost 12 hours a day making snacks and making packets for selling and assembling electrical bulbs. In this process her family earns a monthly profit of 6,000 INR. According to Padmini this amount is not sufficient to manage her business as well as the family expenses. Therefore, she wants to buy a stock of raw materials like cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items so that they have enough stock to carry on their business regularly without any intervention and earn some extra profit. So Padmini has planned to use the present loan to buy cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items in bulk. Thereby she will save transportation cost and get the cash discount. She hopes to purchase a leaf plate pressing machine in the near future to start another business. She also dreams to construct a house building and provide better education to her grandchildren.\r\n \r\nThe other three members of the group named Tapaswini, Urmila and Jayanti are involved in businesses like wholesale fruits, general grocery shop and milk.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1374427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for purchasing of cooking oil, sugar, dough and dry food items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Bolangir, Odisha","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tapaswini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urmila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayanti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":132000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":132000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-07-18T17:52:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574211,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is a 22-year-old married lady with one child.

The women average 46 years of age and six children each; they all live in the Sabalibougou neighborhood, in Commune V, in the Bamako District. They know one another through ties of community and their revenue-generating businesses at the Sabalibougou market. The group members work in the small-scale commerce of vegetables (eggplant, chili peppers, tomatoes, celery), fresh fish, charcoal, and 'pagnes' (the colorful cloth of western Africa). To increase their working capital the group members decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their first solidarity loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMs. Maimouna (the first woman sitting at the far right) is a major vendor of plastic footwear for all ages and of several models at the Sabalibougou market.

She is divorced, but she lives comfortably in her own house with her last son, age 21.  Enith sells replacement parts for vehicles.  In order to do so, she has a warehouse at her ex-husband\u2019s house.  He is the father of her son, and she maintains a commercial relationship with him.  She gets the tools from another city in order to later sell them to the local shops or directly to customers who have vehicles.  \r\n\r\nShe has been working in this business activity for seven years, and she does so with help from another person.  What she likes about her business activity is the income she gets, which she uses to pay the household expenses.  She also pays the university expenses for her son, whom she loves very much.  Additionally, she has managed to use the income to buy some appliances, and she has been able to make repairs to her house.

In the future, she wishes to grow her business and educate, feed, and clothe her children. She thus thanks Hekima for its support as a micro-lender to female entrepreneurs.

Today, he works selling them because his father no longer works due to a broken foot that happened in an accident and now he takes care of his father and his wife by means of the pig sales.

He buys the pigs in places far from his house at a distance of about 10 kilometers which makes transporting them difficult.\r\n\r\nThe loan he\u2019s asking from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to buy more pigs because the price of pigs is good now to generate a higher profit margin because the ones he has now are already sold and he wants to buy more to sell to sell to his customers.  His business has a large turnover and he does not want to disappoint his customers; he needs the money to buy more because the money he has is insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe loan will improve his life because he works selling pigs and the money he earns from the sales, his profits, will be used to buy more pigs and his household income will increase at the same time so he can buy his father\u2019s medicine and improve his wife\u2019s living condition.

Tsira lives in the Rustavi district with her 56-year-old husband. Tsira has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for her family business start-up, but she hasn't had any success. Her loan request was rejected every time because of her low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\nTsira sells jewelry. She buys the products at the wholesale prices and re-sells them among her neighbors with the price marked up to earn a small monthly income. Her husband works for a small salary at the local factory. \r\nTsira requested loan from Credo to start her family business. Tsira has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With her credit, Tsira will start re-selling perfume. She will buy from the big market at the wholesale price and re-sell it with the jewelry among the neighbors with the price marked up.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nSakhib has a car, and he drives it as a taxi, transporting local people. His wife is a tailor, working on private orders. They both earn small monthly salaries, which is rarely enough to cover their food expenses.\r\n \r\nSakhib requested a loan from Credo to start-up family business. Sakhib has now been approved for a loan, within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits, with soft conditions, to rural poor people who do not have access to other credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit Sakhib will start a business, trading in shoes. He will buy them at the wholesale price from the market, and resell among the people of his village with a price mark-up. Sakhib will earn a good profit and will be able to ensure a better life for his family.

She is single, and lives with her older brother as part of a traditional family in Wayerma I, a popular neighborhood in the town of Sikasso (located in the third-largest administrative region of Mali). For about five years she has worked buying and selling high-grade pagnes [traditional wraparound cloth], sheets, embroidered fabrics, and similar items. She works from home and on the streets of Sikasso, where she is in great demand among her customers due to the quality of her products. \r\n \r\nTo meet the needs of her ever-growing customer base, Fanta Mahine decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution five years ago. After several group loans as part of a local women's association, she is now on her fifth individual loan.

His greatest monthly expense is food for the family.\r\n\r\nJames sells his charcoal from his home to his neighbors and to passers-by. His major challenge in the business is the high cost of transportation. He decided to join Yehu to access loans to boost his business. With the loan he is requesting, he intends to purchase bags of charcoal to offer for sale.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Shoot for the stars, and if you miss, at least you will end among the stars.\" \"I am following this saying,\" giggled Nengjadim. She is one of the members with \u201cLily\u201d Group. She is pictured with her hand raised, and she is the featured borrower member for the group. She is hardworking and determined in whatever she does. Both she and her husband earn for the family, and her husband is a daily wage-earner. \n\nThe group members were all inspired through the teamwork and collaboration shown through \"Nisopah Group\". They are active members with WSDS, and the secretary of the group conveyed the benefits of the formation of Self-Help groups to \"Lily Group\". \n\nNengjadim raises livestock like cows, sheep and buffaloes.  She generates income after selling the milk that the cow produces and also makes money by offering the buffaloes for farming purposes on a hiring basis during the ploughing seasons. She makes good money because modern farming machines are unaffordable for the village cultivators. She also raises sheep and sells them when they are fully grown. \n\nShe makes a good income, but it is completely unreliable. The source of income for Nengjadim and her husband entirely depends on seasons because during off-seasons the income is tight. Managing the household expenses and running the family without a regular income is complicated for Nengjadim. Her main trade is selling sheep in the neighbouring villages. Buyers come to her house to purchase the sheep and she also takes them to the local market and sells them at a good price.\n\nWith the Kiva loan, she will construct a better and spacious barn for the sheep. She is raising more than twenty sheep at present.  She is glad that Kiva is supporting her for the barn construction, and she plans to own a minivan within ten years. The minivan will be used as a public transport between the village and the capital city. \n\nShe will open a savings account and start saving to make her plans come true. She says even if she and her husband fail to purchase the minivan within ten years, she will purchase an auto rickshaw instead. She dreams high and believes in herself that she will fulfill it.\n\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in poultry, piggery, weaving, and ginger-farming.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1365277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to construct a larger barn for the sheep that she is raising.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-06-24T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-07-24T19:20:05Z","loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingneineng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneihoi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneineng ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengjadim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bebem ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neikim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatkim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Neinu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengkim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-06-25T18:51:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":574058,"name":"Luis Arturo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis de 60 a\u00f1os de edad es un microempresario, dedicado a la venta de productos de la canasta familiar.

As a source of income for her family, Gulgaaky works with livestock breeding and sale of milk, after having started this business 10 years ago with the purchase of two calves. She has developed this to 15 sheep and goats, one cow with offspring and 0.40 hectares of irrigated land with beans and beets. Further, being an active person, Gulgaaky founded a business of sewing national clothing and repairing clothes. Her husband helps her with marketing the products. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Gulgaaky turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two bulls.

As a source of income for her family, Akylai works with livestock breeding and growing agricultural crops, after having started this business in 1997 with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to persistent work, Akylai's farm currently consists of two cows with offspring and 1.20 hectares of irrigated land with beans and beets. Further, over the past years, Akylai has been growing strawberries, which is bringing in a good income during its season. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her business, Akylai turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 25,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of fertilizers.

One of their sons helps Alvard with the farming; he also manages to earn a little extra money by working during holiday seasons in the coastal area of beautiful lake Sevan.\r\n \r\nAlvard is confident that she can manage any hard work, especially if there is the possibility of additional support and help. She has made the decision to request a loan from Kiva lenders in the amount of 600,000 Armenian drams in order to buy two cows and some sheep. \r\n\r\nThis will be Alvard's second loan from Nor Horizon and she is considered a very responsible and trustworthy client.

lives in Malindi, Kenya. She is married and blessed with four children, three of whom attend school. \r\n\r\nSanita has been operating a retail shop for three years now. She sells items such as rice, oil, maize flour and other retail products.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Atswei's Group consists of two ladies, Astwei and Setina, who are neighbours. Atswei, age 42, is the leader of the group. She is shown holding the beverage bottles in the photo. \r\n\r\nAstwei runs a beverage bar in her neighborhood, a business she learned from her mother. Astwei is a single mother with two children, both of whom attend school. She engages in her trade in order to take care of her children and to cover the household expenses, which she handles alone. To meet the family's various expenses, Astwei has been selling drinks like Coca-Cola, Malta Guinness, Sprite, and Fanta in her bar for the past four years. She buys her stock from a distribution depot in Accra. \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the demands of her growing customers and to make more profit, Astwei joins Setina in requesting their fifth loan, totaling GHS 1,700.

is Cecelia from Liberia. She resides in Buchanan, the capital City of Grand Bassa County. The county is located by the sea and is known for its beaches and fish. Many logging companies are also located in the city. People in Buchanan are known in the country for their love of fufu, a cassava-based dough typically eaten with soup or sauce. Cecelia is 47 and married with three children. Her children are between the ages of 19 and 11. Only one is currently living at home and two are in school.  \r\nCecelia has owned her own table business selling beans, peanuts, pepper, flour, etc. for the past two years.  She will use the loan proceeds to purchase more beans, peanuts, pepper, flour, etc. for her business.  \r\nOn average, she works 11 hours at her business from Monday to Saturday. She started her business with a small amount of money from her husband. She transports her merchandise by shared taxi. She cites the rainy season as her biggest challenge. Her favorite part of her business is controlling her own money. In the future, she would like to build a modern shop.  \r\nShe is grateful for your

Their parents taught them to work the land. Agriculture (coffee cultivation) has been their only source of income for many years.
