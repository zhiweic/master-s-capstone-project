She is very pleased that she has already had so many orders and anxiously awaits receipt of the loan.\r\n\r\nShe greatly enjoys working with Fondo Esperanza because she has met many people who have helped her and she has gotten to know other ways of thinking that help her to gain experience. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2114.51,"image":{"id":1461534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase molds, chocolate icing and truffles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:46:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:46:14Z","loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Natalie Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marioly Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mirza De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria De Las Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Valeska Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carolina Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maritza Ivonne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marcela Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Cecilia Karen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Claudina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Cristina Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Luis Damian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Steffi Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marta Magennette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Tatiana Loreto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Roxana Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1371226,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":89085},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94208},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94932},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":95643},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":96370},{"due_date":"2013-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":97112},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":97841},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":98586},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":99331},{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":100078},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100841},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":101606},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":102372},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":103221}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.04},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.21},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.66},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.07},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191.51},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.99},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.91},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.4},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.88},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.4},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.92},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":203.44},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1127.48,"local_amount":567350,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":571857.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503276,"comment":null},{"amount":987.03,"local_amount":496677,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":500622.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728237,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T02:04:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":627300,"name":"Goleta Ancud Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcela quien esta se las primeras en la fotograf\u00eda con jeans y polera azul y mangas negras y pelo casta\u00f1o, adem\u00e1s tiene un l\u00e1piz en la mano; ella pertenece al Banco Comunal Goleta Ancud que est\u00e1 ubicado en Ancud, Castro.

","en":"Marcela is in the front row of the photograph wearing jeans and a blue sweater with black sleeves. She has dark hair and is holding a pen in her hand.  \n\nMarcela belongs to the communal bank Goleta Ancud, which is located in Ancud, Castro. The members of Goleta Ancud have a variety of businesses, including handicrafts, new and used clothing sales, cheese sales, frame sales, sewing, and d\u00e9coupage. \n\nMarcela sells American clothes and new clothes, but her strength is in American clothes, which she began to sell just over a year ago. At the time, she didn't have work and when she came into a bit of money she was able to buy a bale of clothes. Since this went well, she decided to continue selling clothes. Some time ago, she set herself up at a physical store alongside a business partner. However, she had problems with this partner and so she withdrew from the business. She decided to continue to sell clothes in the way that she started - door to door. She has been able to gain many customers in her time selling clothes.\n\nWith the money that she is requesting, Marcela plans to buy more bales of new clothes, since sales have been good but she doesn't have money with which to buy more, and her customers have been asking for more clothing. For this reason, she is sure that things will go well, since her customers are asking her to bring them more clothes. Marcela is happy with Fondo Esperanza's work, and grateful for the classes they offer, in which they provide training on how to look after your business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":7025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4588.79,"image":{"id":1462358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy bales of American clothing and new clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Castro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:46:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:46:14Z","loan_amount":7025,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Marcela Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mirta Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Marcia Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adriana Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gloria Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Iris Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Claudia Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yoselyn Waleska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Naldy Gigliola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Adriana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Dory Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Dorys Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Oriana Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juan Agust\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Juana Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Estelvina Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Lilian Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Hilda Luisa Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Sof\u00eda Carolain","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":3570055,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":7025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":221252},{"due_date":"2013-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":246133},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":248000},{"due_date":"2013-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":249878},{"due_date":"2013-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":251777},{"due_date":"2013-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":253690},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":255608},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":257549},{"due_date":"2013-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":257776},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":261454},{"due_date":"2014-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":264598},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":265445},{"due_date":"2014-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":267459},{"due_date":"2014-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":269436}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":435.37},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":484.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":488},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":491.7},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.44},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":499.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":502.97},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.8},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":507.24},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":514.48},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":520.66},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":522.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":526.3},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":530.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":2394.84,"local_amount":1217040,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T15:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1218251.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429503277,"comment":null},{"amount":2193.95,"local_amount":1114952,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T12:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1116061.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439728238,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T06:22:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":624172,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie is 48 years old.

He has been driving a taxi for  10 years and is already a very skillful driver. Due to his hard work, Seyran earns enough income to cover his family's daily costs. \n\nUnfortunately his car is now in bad condition and Seyran has no saved money for renovating it. So by applying for this loan he is asking for a financial support to be able to pay for renovation of the car and to purchase new tires. He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international.

","en":"Gulkayir is a 39 years old widow raising three children by herself.  Gulkayir has a secondary education and has very good reviews from her neighbors. They refer to her as a kind and hard-working woman. Gulkayir is the main source of income for the family.  Since 2006, she has worked as a vendor selling food and sweets, having started this business with 20,000 KGS. She sells food items and sweets out of a container. Thanks to her hard work, Gulkayir has been able to develop and expand her product.  Her business brings her about 20,000 KGS per month, which helps pay for the cost of food and other household needs for the family. The income she has received from the business has allowed Gulkayir to expand her trade. In order to further develop her business, Gulkayir has appealed to the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" Microfinance Bank for a loan in the amount of 130,000 KGS for the purchase of wholesale food and sweets for resale.  Gulkayir will use the income from the loan to help increase turnover and the increased profit will help her raise and educate her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":174.33,"image":{"id":1459203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy food for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chekelik village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:47:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:47:17Z","loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulkayir","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4344},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4128},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4231},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4337},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4445},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4556},{"due_date":"2014-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4670},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4787},{"due_date":"2014-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4906},{"due_date":"2014-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5029},{"due_date":"2014-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5155},{"due_date":"2014-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5284},{"due_date":"2014-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5416},{"due_date":"2014-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5551},{"due_date":"2015-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5690},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5832},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5978},{"due_date":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6127},{"due_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6281},{"due_date":"2015-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6438},{"due_date":"2015-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6599},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6764},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6933},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6519}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.39},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.94},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.1},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.5},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.95},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.48},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.45},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.22},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.08},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.01},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.07},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":174.33,"local_amount":8472,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8490.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439942677,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-12-07T18:44:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":625298,"name":"Hasan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasan is an experienced agronomist from Metsamor village in the Armavir region.

is 36 years old and married with an 18-year-old son. His retired mother lives with the family as well. In fact, the family lives without a source of income, as the family members are jobless and the small agricultural activities they have are insignificant.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate income, Shalva decided to purchase a truck and work on firewood transportation. With this loan, Shalva will pay for the truck and start the business. He will carry firewood from the forest, cut it, and sell it to locals.

48-year-old Memunatu from Waterloo2,in the eastern area in Freetown. She is married with three children. \n\nIn 2010, Memunatu established her vendor business. She works at the business from 8am to 12 pm, 7 days per week. She began her business because she wants to be independent.

from Sierra Leone! This is 45-year-old Isatu from Waterloo2 in the eastern area of Freetown. She is married with 3 children between the ages of 7 years and 25 years. Two of her children are attending school. She started her business for the daily survival of her family.\r\n \r\nIsatu runs a food stand business. She sells cooking seasonings, palm oil and rice within a busy market area. She has been running this business since 2009. She works at the business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week. Isatu says that the main challenge to her business is the problem of price control in the market.\r\n\r\nIsatu has requested a loan in order to buy food commodities like cooking seasonings, palm oil and rice for resale. The extra income from this loan will allow her to educate her children. In the future, she plans to have a big provision shop. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.52,"image":{"id":1457682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

50-year-old Ramatu from Waterloo2 Eastern area in Freetown.

She works at the business 9 hours per day, every day. She says that the main challenges to her business are price inflation and insufficient capital to expand her business.\r\n\r\nRamatu requires a loan in order to purchase more items like cigarettes, biscuits, soap and pure water. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to increase her business and have a permanent business location. In the future, Ramatu plans to own the biggest shop in the community.

38-year-old Fatmata from Waterloo2, an eastern area in Freetown. She is married, with three children between the ages of four years and 18 years.  \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Fatmata established her local food business. She began her business because she wanted to generate her own source of income. She works at the business from 8:00am until 7:00pm, seven days per week. She says that the main challenges to her business are insufficient capital to expand her business and the problem of transportation.\r\n\r\nFatmata requires a loan in order to purchase more cashew nuts to expand her business. She hopes that the extra income from this loan will allow her to change her status of living and to increase her business. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata plans to further expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.52,"image":{"id":1457715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He will be happy to not have to go out looking for someone to lend him the money.\r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to go on providing for his family, to increase his land and to be able to take advantage of the water resources that exist near where he works.

He has a spouse and his wife just does domestic chores.  He has three children only one of whom attends school. Because of his age they decided it was better to help him work.\r\n\r\nLucas works growing basic grains like beans and corn.  Sometimes he\u2019s also planted vegetables but the lack of economic resources prevented him from continuing to do so.  He\u2019s been working in agriculture for about 30 years; he helped his father when he was still a boy and when he decided to start his relationship decided to continue working in this activity to provide food for his wife and children.  He depends solely on agriculture.  The parcel of land he works is about 20 minutes from home and he gets there on foot.  He leaves home at 5:30am and returns at 2:30pm.\r\n\r\nHe needs financing because an institution has arrived that provides technical assistance and part of the materials needed to plant vegetables and install a small irrigation system but they require a co-payment to cover expenses.  The co-payment he\u2019ll make will be deposited in the institution\u2019s bank account.

He hopes that he can improve sanitation practices in his household."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":26.47,"image":{"id":1459019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To construct a proper latrine for his family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kandal province, Sa Ang district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-11-02T01:48:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-01-01T01:48:20Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pok","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":340000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.83},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.83},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.83},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":17.65,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":71611.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429643063,"comment":null},{"amount":8.82,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T11:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35805.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440093261,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-11-02T13:17:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
