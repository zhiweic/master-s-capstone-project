Razac is 17 years old and lives in the town of Kalerwe in the Kampala east region of Uganda. For the past two years, Razac has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Razac has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes for resale and will help Razac to generate greater profits and pay house rent and other expenses at home like buying food. Razac hopes that in the future, she will be able to own a shopping mall. \r\n\r\nRazac is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

En Latacunga, por encontrarse a unos 2.800 metros sobre el nivel del mar el clima suele ser g\u00e9lido, pero subtropical en el lado occidental de la provincia, el clima es c\u00e1lido h\u00famedo por su cercan\u00eda a la regi\u00f3n costanera del pa\u00eds.

Because Latacunga is at an elevation of 2800 meters above sea level the weather tends to be frigid but it\u2019s subtropical on the west of the province; it\u2019s warm and humid due to its proximity to the country\u2019s coastal region.  \r\n\r\nOne of the better known, most popular festivals is \u201cMama Negra\u201d which properly celebrates Latacunga\u2019s independence.  However, the celebration goes much further than that since it\u2019s a mixture of religion, pagan both Spanish and even African celebrations .  Because of this the celebration is very colorful as noted in the traditional parade that takes place on September 23 and 24, the Fall Equinox.\r\n\r\nThe death of Segundo\u2019s wife has caused his life to be not at all an easy one because he\u2019s had to be both father and mother for his children.

For the last 12 years Segundo has worked raising animals which is an occupation he learned from his family who were in the same occupation.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn higher income, Segundo wants to invest in nutritionally balanced feed for his pigs so that he will have big, well-nourished animals to sell.  Although he works with no help, Segundo is optimistic and sure that with this investment his quality of life will improve and with it so will the quality of life of his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1078211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy feed for his pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T03:20:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo Lino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":528,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":53.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":57.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.27},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.65},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":48.6,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134391,"comment":null},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":49.21,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":51.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092731,"comment":null},{"amount":52.53,"local_amount":50.43,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334525,"comment":null},{"amount":53.27,"local_amount":51.14,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":53.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390453,"comment":null},{"amount":54.3,"local_amount":52.13,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":54.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149443,"comment":null},{"amount":55.54,"local_amount":53.32,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":55.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382566,"comment":null},{"amount":56.44,"local_amount":54.18,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":56.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989656,"comment":null},{"amount":57.63,"local_amount":55.33,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":57.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126069,"comment":null},{"amount":118.4,"local_amount":113.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":118.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339516675,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-03T21:34:30Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":418358,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis es un joven de 21 a\u00f1os muy entusiasta y trabajador, vive en el distrito de la Tingui\u00f1a, Ica, Per\u00fa, este distrito se caracteriza por su agricultura, en especial el cultivo de algod\u00f3n, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n por el carisma y amabilidad de sus pobladores;

For the past 4 years, Emma has been working hard to manage his small business, which sells molasses that the locals drink. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Emma has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more molasses for making drinks for resale, and will help Emma to generate greater profits and to add more stock in his shop. Emma hopes that, in the future, he will be able to expand his business. \r\n\r\nEmma is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Emma who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1082162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

This region, in the middle of the Andes, has a very traditional community dedicated mainly to agriculture and livestock.  In Latacunga, which is at 2,800 meters above sea level, the climate tends to be cold, but in the subtropics, on the western side of the province, it is warm and humid because of its proximity to the coastal region of the country.\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked-about and popular festivals is the one for Mama Negra, which is precisely the independence of Latacunga.  Nevertheless, the celebration goes beyond that because it is a mixture of religion with pagan, Spanish, and even African influences.  For this reason the celebration has a lot of color that is represented in the traditional parade that takes place in September, on the 23rd and 24th, the day of the fall equinox.\r\n\r\nEdison has worked for three years raising animals, a job he learned from his mother.  He has not had the opportunity to study, so he only finished his primary education.  Edison has made the decision to become a professional driver.  In this way he will work driving heavy transport or in public or private service, and get greater income.  This job is very attractive to him because he likes to drive.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will get he will be able to pay for his course and his professional license, so he will be able to achieve his short-term objective.\r\n\r\nIn his free time he will continue working with his animals, for which he will have the help of his mother.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":1078280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to be able to pay for his professional driver's license.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T06:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edison Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":661.66,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.6},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":60.08},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.76},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":49.79,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134393,"comment":null},{"amount":51.37,"local_amount":50.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":51.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092733,"comment":null},{"amount":572.84,"local_amount":561.52,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":572.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334527,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T16:45:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":420212,"name":"Sina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aged 48, Sina is a married mother of three children who all are still in school.

She lives in a village of the Tbaung Khmum district where crop farming is a common way to earn a living. She is a farmer who has been farming rice on one hectare of farmland for 8 years. She supplements her income by planting cassava on a half hectare of farmland. Having earned a living as a farmer, she has been challenged by price fluctuations for her cassava crops. \r\n\r\nKimyi has been with Kiva's field partner, VisionFund, for two loan cycles, while the others are just with VisionFund this loan cycle. Kimyi was selected as the leader of the group. The past loans have helped Kimyi to afford to buy a plot of farmland. She now can earn up to KHR 12,000 per day from her current business. Having successfully paid back the loans, she is leading her group to apply for a loan with VisionFund. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy fertilizer and seedlings for her farmland.

For the past two years, Rebecca has been working hard to manage her small business selling clothes. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rebecca has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

For the past two years, she has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells sugar and soap. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane is requesting a loan of 500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda, which she will use to purchase more commodities such as sugar to sell.  The loan will help Jane generate greater profits and pay for her medical expenses. She hopes that in the future she will be able to build a house for herself. \r\n\r\nJane is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jane's future prospects by helping her to learning how to save money.

is Gloria, resident of Bacoor, Cavite, Philippines. She is married and mother of her children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\n\nGloria sells processed meat products. What she basically does is buy processed meat products from wholesalers and then she sells them by the piece or pack for a profit. Products can include ham, hotdogs, processed pork and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options she offers. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products including more varieties to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nGloria hopes to be able to expand soon, as she dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":1079875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for additional stock of processed meat products needed in her business  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T15:30:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5333,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5690.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095716,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2134.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287359325,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2845.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294303140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-01T22:54:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:12:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":420448,"name":"Villamora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Villamora is 45 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She successfully paid back the loans with VisionFund. The previous loans have helped her improve her living condition and she is able to earn daily income of up to 21,000 KHR from her business. Her group members are applying for a loan of 1,000,000 Khmer Riels each. As the leader, Leng Sour wants to use her portion to buy fertilizer for her farmland. She hopes to increase her crop yields and earn more income so as to fulfill her dream of having a decent house for living in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1082894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer for her farmland","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Banteay Meanchey Province, Mongkol Borey District","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T15:50:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leang Sour","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chhenglun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nay ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1516125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315518950,"comment":null},{"amount":375,"local_amount":1500000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T20:04:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1516125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355940825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-04-30T17:34:57Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T20:04:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":420492,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka is a 33-year-old married woman.

She has worked in this field for 28 years, and she has done this independently for 21 years.   She learned by teaching herself because she inherited this occupation.  Specifically, Luisa makes clothing for companies and schools.  She works directly from her home.   She equipped her shop on the patio of her house, where she has the help of some sewing machines.  Among the machines she has are an industrial overlock machine, an industrial stitching machine, an embroidery machine, and an electrical collar machine (a special machine used to make collars and cuffs).\r\n\r\nHer work schedule during the week is established according to the orders that her customers make.

She has been involved in animal husbandry for 22 years, having started this business with a purchase of a heifer.  Thanks to Nurgul's hard work, today her business contains one cow with a calf, ten sheep with lambs and one horse.  The monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to 7,000 som.  In order to further develop her business, Nurgul requested a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy dairy cows, which will allow her to increase milk volumes, and one bull for fattening up.

She has been involved in animal husbandry for 13 years, having started this business with a purchase of a heifer.  Thanks to Kalbubu's hard work, today her business contains one cow with a calf, five sheep with lambs, five goats and one horse.  The monthly profit from sales of milk products amounts to 5,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Kalbubu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow, which will allow her to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a continued increase of domestic livestock quantities.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":1082115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Say village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-04-30T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-05-30T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kalbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":645},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":645,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-17T09:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":30222.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938568,"comment":null},{"amount":430,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":20148.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754664,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-05-26T22:17:47Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:23:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":420655,"name":"Visitacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Visitacion is 58 years old and lives in Lamao, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.
