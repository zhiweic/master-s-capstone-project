Sonunbu has a high school education, is very fair, responsible, and conscientious, and follows her ethics. Sonunbu earns the primary income for her family by raising livestock. She started 22 years ago with 5,000 som (KGS) worth of animals. Thanks to her tireless work she now owns a dairy cow, 25 sheep, and a 1.0 hectare parcel of land where she raises watermelon and cantaloupe. The income from her field crops is around 150,000 som (KGS) per year. Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS). With the goal of further expanding her business, Sonunbu is asking the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan to buy sheep and their feed. She will later sell them at the market for a profit. She plans to invest income from the loan into further expanding her number of livestock, and also plans to save some funds for her son's wedding.

Margaret described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMargaret first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Margaret joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed family and send children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Margaret\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, more farm training, more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T00:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T00:50:09Z","loan_amount":5375,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hennry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phylis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":465363,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465363}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645022,"name":"Huong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huong is 29 years old and married with two children.

He is pictured here in a group of 6 One Acre Fund group leader farmers. The group leaders represent a total of 73 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Joseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.<br \/> <br \/>Joseph is 62 years old and has been a farmer for 46 years. He works as a farmer to provide for his eight children. The community and other farmers know Joseph as a friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and experienced farmer.<br \/><br \/>In addition to farming, he is also involved in community activities such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee. Joseph described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.<br \/> <br \/>Joseph joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family. Because he is an active community member, Joseph wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Joseph has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Joseph's life because he has more profits from his harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support and is able to save money. In the future, Joseph hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair his home, save for the future, buy a goat, and invest in a business.<br \/><br \/>Joseph  and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.

Most of the members here are itinerant business people, vendors in the markets and also seamstresses. \r\n\r\nEdith worked in La Vega for 20 years, but when there was a fire in 2009 she left her stall in La Vega because the landlords raised their prices a lot. This is why she decided to start a business in an independent manner and began to sell empanadas, tamales and sopapillas. Her family is very entrepreneurial; her children have also helped her to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe money she is asking for is to be able to buy supplies like beef, oil, flour, chicken and corn, as she currently has no money to be able to make her foods and sell them. She hopes she does well with the sales, because her customers have asked her for products but she doesn't have any way to make them.\r\n\r\nWhat she has liked most about working with Fondo Esperanza is feeling accompanied and supported by an institution. She has met a lot of people and that makes her very happy.

Metrine has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised.  Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 90 other individual farmers represented in this group.  The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMetrine is married and has 4 children.  She is 43-years-old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group and burial committee.  Metrine has been a farmer for fifteen years.  Metrine described her harvest as poor last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nMetrine first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Metrine joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer, hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she likes being a leader, and as an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Metrine plans to use the money that she earns from her next harvest to send children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow and invest in a business.  She notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Metrine\u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n \r\nMetrine and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T01:30:05Z","loan_amount":5575,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":481410,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481410}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656455,"name":"Saroeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saroeun is 29 years old.

Her oldest daughter is married, but the rest of her children are still in school.  Odinakhan has a high school education.  As a main source of income, Odinakhan raises livestock and grows crops, a business that she started 23 years ago with a purchase of cattle for 8,000 som (KGS).  All of her children and her spouse are involved in helping her with the farm work.  Thanks to Odinakhan's hard work, she now has three milking cows and 25 sheep.  She also has a 1.08 hectares of land where she grows corn and clover for the cattle feed as well as rice for sale.  Her monthly income is 15,000 som (KGS).  \r\n\r\nIn order to expand her business, Odinakhan turned to the microfinance bank of Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan to purchase a car.

He is pictured here in a group of 9 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 99 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. Hudson has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHudson is married and has three children. He is 71 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community activities in groups, such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Hudson has been a farmer for 18 years. He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nHudson first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Hudson joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  \r\n\r\nHudson plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home and save for the future. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Hudson\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from the harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nHudson and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":6125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cost-efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T02:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T02:30:11Z","loan_amount":6125,"lender_count":179,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hudson","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lonah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":529551,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":6125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":529551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-19T23:34:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645059,"name":"Cuc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cuc is 36 years -old and married.

For more than 23 years she has been working in the field of sales. She began in a business that belonged to her mother-in-law. Later she worked as an employee in other stores. In the year 2008 with the desire to generate more income and spend more time with her family she opened a stationary shop. It also offered photocopying and fax services and she sold cosmetics and accessories. Her business was well received in the area and two years ago she added sewing services taking advantage of having studied fashion design. She sells the dresses she makes herself and also does alterations of clothing. Doing this she makes the money to help her husband with the finances of the household.  \r\n\r\nThe loan Miriam is requesting is to buy a wrapping machine (an industrial sewing machine) and supplies wholesale (fabric, thread and buttons) and stationary items (notebooks, pens, markers, Bristol board, etc.). This will allow her to continue her work and with the machine she can minimize the production time and deliver the products with a high quality finish.

Jessey has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and is on the right of the photo with his hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to him and the 83 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 Kenyan Shillings (KES).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJessey is 48 years old and has been a farmer for 26 years. Jessey works as a farmer to provide for his four children. The community and other farmers know Jessey as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, he is also involved in his community's activities, such as the savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Jessey described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJessey first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Jessey joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, new farming methods, and fertilizers and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed the family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader, and as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. Jessey plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Jessey\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family. \r\n\r\nJessey and his group need the loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T05:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:10:02Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tunai","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pharis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shadrack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":443967,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645043,"name":"Maritess","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritess is 33, married to a security guard and blessed with three children.

Melisa has volunteered to be the Kiva group representative, and is on the right of the photo with her hand raised. Farming inputs will be delivered to her and the 89 other individual farmers represented in this group. The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum. The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMelisa is 52 years old and has been a farmer for 28 years. Melisa works as a farmer to provide for her five children. The community and other farmers know Melisa as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. Other than farming, she is also involved in her community's activities, such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Melisa described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMelisa first enrolled in One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. Melisa joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, the new farming methods, and the fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school. She also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because she is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. \r\n\r\nMelisa plans to use the money she earns from her next harvest to send her children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, and invest in a business. She notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. Melisa \u2019s own life was improved because she has more profits from the harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMelisa and her group need the loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizers through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low, and passes the cost savings to the farmers.

Buumarjan has a higher education, and works as a teacher in the local school.  As a qualified teacher, she enjoys respect and authority amongst the villagers.  Buumarjan's work in livestock and farming, which she began 11 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 15,000 KGS, serves as her family's major source of income.  Thanks to Buumarjan's hard work, she currently has 2 milk cows and 2 hectares of land, on which she and her family plant beans to sell.  Her husband helps with the housework.  To limit the risk of her cattle developing disease, Buumarjan gives antibiotics to her animals 2 times per year.

He is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 69 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Joseph has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet to cultivate.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\r\nJoseph is married and has seven children.  He is 52 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  He is active in his community in the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Joseph has been a farmer for 23 years. He described his harvest as excellent last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \r\n\r\nJoseph joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  He joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school.  \r\n\r\nSince Joseph likes being a leader and an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Joseph has become more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Joseph's life because he has more profits from harvest, farm training, and farm group support. He was able to save money and feed his family.  In the future, Joseph hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, to repair the home, to save for the future, to buy a cow, and to invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nJoseph and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyongesa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":369081,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369081}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645088,"name":"Thao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thao, 41 years old, is married and has two sons.

together with her husband, raised 3 children.  Her two daughters are married, and her son and his family live with Rakhima.  Her son has four children, who help Rakhima with housework.  Rakhima has a secondary education.  Rakhima's work in animal husbandry and farming, which began 25 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 3000 KGS, serves as the major source of income for Rakhima's family.  Thanks to Rakhima's hard work, she now has in her care 2 milk cows, and also 0.65 hectares of land, on which she raises potatoes, corn, and vegetables.  Her monthly income is 10,000 KGS, though her son, who is a construction worker, also contributes financially.  His income goes to his mother to help the family.  Rakhima sells potatoes, corn, and vegetables for cash, and her yearly income from crops is about 80,000 KGS.  With the goal of further increasing the size of her herd, Rakhima turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase cows to fatten and resell at  the market for a higher price.  With the income earned from the loan, Rakhima plans to continue to increase the size of her herd."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1509099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cows to fatten and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulbahor village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2014-01-13T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rakhima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7079},{"due_date":"2014-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":7286},{"due_date":"2014-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7498},{"due_date":"2014-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7717},{"due_date":"2014-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7942},{"due_date":"2014-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8174},{"due_date":"2014-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8412},{"due_date":"2014-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8657},{"due_date":"2014-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":8910},{"due_date":"2014-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":9170},{"due_date":"2014-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9437},{"due_date":"2014-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":9718}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.12},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.81},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.44},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.47},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.98},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.46},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656109,"name":"Gulshaiyr","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u0448\u0430\u0439\u044b\u0440 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0434\u043e\u0447\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430. \u0423 \u0413\u0443\u043b\u0448\u0430\u0439\u044b\u0440 -

Two of them are living by themselves, away from their parents.  Jiydegul has a secondary education, and works cleaning floors, windows, and walls in a school.  Jiydegul's work in animal husbandry, beginning 14 years ago with the purchase of cattle for 5,000 KGS, serves as a source of additional income for her family.  Thanks to Jiydegul's hard work, she now has in her herd 3 milk cows, 1 mare, 3 sheep, and 4 goats.  Her monthly income is 12,000 KGS.  With the goal of continuing to increase her economy, Jiydegul turned to the microfinance bank \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for a loan to purchase foals for breeding.  For the care of animals, she has procured 400 pieces of pressed hay, 1 ton of barley, and 1.2 hectares of land.

She is pictured here in a group of seven One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 84 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Walubengo has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with her hand raised.  She and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet to cultivate.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 KES for maize, millet, and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nWalubengo is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 27 years.  She works as a farmer to provide for her seven children. The community and other farmers know Walubengo as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer.  In addition to farming, she is also involved in community groups such as the women's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee.  Walubengo described her harvest last year as good, but hopes she can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in her group.\r\n\r\nWalubengo joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling for the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  She joined One Acre Fund so that she could get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, obtain fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed her family and send her children to school.  Because she likes being a leader and an active community member, she wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Walubengo has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Walubengo's life because she has more profits from harvest, farm training, and farm group support. She was able to save money and feed her family.  In the future, Walubengo hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send her children to school, to repair the home, to save for the future, and to buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Walubengo and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left side of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to provide Kenyan farmers with increased access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for growing maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T06:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T06:10:05Z","loan_amount":5200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walubengo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonard","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Murumba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilikista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ezron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":449316,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":449316}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645096,"name":"Sultana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sulatana is a 26-year-old married woman who lives with her husband in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

The members have different businesses and are merchants, provide services, and do other activities.  A short time ago they decided to join the institution so they can get loans.\r\n\r\nRita is one of the members.  She is 45 years old, married, and has an eight year old son who attends a local school.  Her husband is a retired police officer.\r\n\r\nRita used the money from the first loan to start her business.  She built a small farm where she raises chickens.  She began with very little and increased her number of chickens over the following days and months.  She buys them small, raises them for two or three months and then sells them by the pound or whole to area residents or to merchants who sell them in other areas.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward is 48 years old and has been a farmer for 20 years.  Edward works as a farmer to provide for his six children.  The community and other farmers know Edward as hardworking, reliable and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Edward described his harvest last year as excellent, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nEdward joined One Acre Fund in 2010, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Edward joined One Acre Fund so that he could get the best seed prices and send his children to school.  Because he is an active community member, Edward has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Edward's life because he has more farm training and is able to feed the family.  In the future, Edward hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school and buy a cow.  \r\n\r\nEdward and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo

Alijon has a hothouse where he raises lemons, which he sells at the Vakhsh regional market.  He has been in this business for about 5 years.   His politeness, high quality lemons, and his keen sense of smell all set him apart from his competition.  Alijon puts his whole heart into his work.  He wants his clients to be pleased with his lemons.\r\n\r\nAlijon prepared and planted a crop in time for the onset of winter.  However, the crop needs to be saved because the roof of the hothouse is in dire need of repair.  The roof needs repairs very badly.  Alijon is requesting a loan to buy fittings, wire, and tenting so he can repair the roof and save his crop of lemons.  Alijon hopes that his work won't have been in vain and that he will have a harvest.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1490222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fittings, wire, and tenting for hothouse repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T09:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T09:10:01Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alijon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2014-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":413}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645109,"name":"Sokheang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokheang is 53 years old and has a family with five children.

The family is involved in agricultural activities. They have one milk-cow whose products are sold locally, and a plot of agricultural land belongs to the family. They cultivate the land and get a small income from its products. As Irma's husband doesn't have his own activity except transfers, he wants to do his bit for the welfare of the family and start his own activity. The start-up program, which is a joint initiative between Kiva and Credo, enables rural poor and inexperienced people to get a loan for starting or re-starting businesses. Irma's application was approved under the framework of this program to get a loan of 4,000 GEL to purchase working tools abroad, pay the toll for them, and open a vehicle repair workshop. Irma's husband will work as an artisan and generate income from private orders. The business initiative will be profitable because of its location and being the only workshop in the area.

Isaac has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nIsaac is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 10 years.  Isaac works as a farmer to provide for his two children.  The community and other farmers know Isaac as friendly, hardworking and trustworthy.  Other than farming, he is also involved in his community groups such as the men's group and prayer group. \r\n\r\nIsaac was not with One Acre Fund last year, and hopes he can have a better harvest this year with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in the group.\t\r\n\r\nIsaac has just enrolled with One Acre Fund this year and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Isaac joined One Acre Fund in order to get new farming methods.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member.  Isaac plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers and that is why he has joined them.   \r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Isaac and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gentrix","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":299544,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299544}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656545,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is a 63-year-old married man.

Because he is an active community member, Kaipasi has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Kaipasi's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training and was able to save money.  In the future, Kaipasi hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and invest in a business.  \t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Kaipasi and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\r\n\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":5125,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kaipasi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gilbert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chrispinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercylyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":443967,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":5125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656537,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a 44-year-old married woman.

56 years old, married, and is raising 4 children.  Two of her children are married and live with their own families.  Her daughter, who is in school, and her youngest son live at home.  Sveta has a secondary level education and has very good references from her neighbors.  They say that she is a decent, hard working woman.  \r\n\r\nHer family's main income is Sveta's business of selling fruit and vegetables at the local market.  She started this business in 1995.  Her inventory includes various types of grapes, apples, date plums, pomegranates, beets, onions, cabbage, tomatoes, Bulgarian peppers, and herbs.  She started her business with 3,000 som (KGS), but as a result of her hard work she has been able to develop and expand her business.  Today, it brings in about 25,000 som (KGS) per month, which is the basis for covering her family's grocery and day-to-day expenses.\r\n\r\nFor supplemental income, Sveta and her husband are also in the animal husbandry business, which she has been doing for many years.  She started this business with 15,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her hard work, today she has 2 milk cows, a heifer, 2 calves, and 10 sheep.  The income from her businesses allowed Sveta to expand her inventory and to buy a car.  \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further developing her business, Sveta applied to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan with which she will buy vegetables and fruits at wholesale.  Sveta wants to increase her income leading up to New Year's, since sales go up before the holidays.  Sveta plans to use the income from the loan to invest in growing her business further.  She also wants to finish building her partially completed home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1490916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables at wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn town","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T15:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T15:10:07Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sveta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7827},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8023},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8223},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8429},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8640},{"due_date":"2014-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8858}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.45},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.48},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.57},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.79},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.12},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-12-16T15:09:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656541,"name":"Pastor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pastor previously accessed a loan of 18,000 PHP that he utilized to buy gardening materials and supplies needed in his business.

Near the village where they live, Margarit and her husband own a plot of agricultural land where they cultivate grass which is hardly enough for feeding the livestock. This couple works hard to sustain their family's living and the only source of their income is agriculture. Margarit has already taken a loan from local financial institutions before. But becasue of the family's hard financial condition, she wasn't able to pay it back on time. Due to her and her family's hard work during recent years, Margarit was able to become financially stable ensuring that she will be able to cover monthly payments. Margarit now asks this loan for being able to purchase 2 cows, 2 oxen and forage for feeding the livestock. So, she has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Stephen\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.  \t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Stephen and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489560,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To support farmers in purchasing hybrid seeds and fertilizer to increase better harvests of maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T15:30:06Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akhuyanga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":342336,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656599,"name":"Gurgen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gurgen is a 27-year-old married man.

Ensuring that she will be able to cover the monthly payments of new loan, Armenuhi has now applied for this loan. She has been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF international. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products. Armenuhi will be very grateful to lenders for giving her a second chance to improve her agribusiness and sustain better living conditions for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1510197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for 3 pigs, forage for feeding livestock, fertilizer and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Dalarik village of Armavir region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":"2014-01-13T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T16:10:09Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armenuhi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.13},{"due_date":"2014-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":51.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.13},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2014-01-23T19:46:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":656700,"name":"Nshan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nshan is from Taperakan village, of the Ararat region.

Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\t\r\nWycliffe is 32 years old and has been a farmer for 11 years.  Wycliffe works as a farmer to provide for his 5 children.  The community and other farmers know Wycliffe as an experienced and hardworking farmer.  Other than farming, he is also involved in community groups such as the men's group and savings group.  Wycliffe described his harvest last year as good, but hopes he can have an even better one with the support of One Acre Fund and the other farmers in his group.\r\n\r\nWycliffe joined One Acre Fund in 2008, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund so that he could learn new farming methods.  Because he is an active community member, Wycliffe has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Wycliffe's life because he received training and was able to feed the family.  In the future, Wycliffe hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to invest in a business.\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Wycliffe and his group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seed and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.

He sells the gathered harvest locally and gathers income which is vital for his family's living. Due to the hard work of Ararat and his family members, local resellers know him as a hardworking farmer and prefer to purchase products from him. Now by asking for this loan Ararat asks for financial support. As the greenhouse that he owns is too old, Ararat needs to purchase pipes and a plastic cover for it. The loan will also be used for purchasing forage for feeding the livestock. As this is Ararat's first loan, it has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF.

She became interested in graphic arts at a young age when she was in elementary school. There she learned about perspective and different color palates. In computer classes over the years she had lessons on how to use the program Scratch.  When she entered 10th grade she had classes in Graphic Arts, Audiovisual Media, and Science and Technology, where she learned about different kinds of photography, created web pages, studied high and low relief and the volume and shadow of objects. \r\n\r\nIn the second half of 2013 she entered university to study Graphic Arts and Advertising, learning, and putting into practice all the knowledge she is acquiring from her instructors. Currently she is ready to start the second semester of the program and is eagerly waiting to learn from her instructors. Her short-term goal is to begin the second semester at the university and continue to study Graphic Arts and Advertising.  Her medium-term goal is to graduate as a Professional Graphic Arts and Advertising technician and begin to work for a company where she can apply all the knowledge she acquired in the program.  In that way she will be able to continue to help her parents and sisters without having to interrupt her studies so she can go on to earn a professional degree. \r\n\r\nIn the long-run, Alexandra sees her own advertising company offering job opportunities to young people who have the same interest in Graphic Arts and Advertising so that they can afford to study for such a career while they are young.

She is the mother of a young daughter, for whom she struggles daily in order to ensure her care and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDuring her working life she has worked in different companies, but six months ago she had the chance to get a grocery store.  With some savings that she had, she managed to buy the business and started to earn her living independently, with the added bonus of getting to spend more time with her family.  She works alone every day and offers basic staples.  At this point, she has been very welcomed in the neighborhood, which has allowed her to earn money to support her husband with the financial needs of their home.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of positioning and strengthening her business in the market, she wants to invest in order to increase her inventory and have a bigger variety to offer her customers.  It is because of this that she is asking for the support of a loan.

He is pictured here in a group of 5 One Acre Fund group leader farmers.  The group leaders represent a total of 57 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here.  Wycliffe has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 8 children.  Wycliffe is 54 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 45 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Wycliffe is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, savings group, prayer group and the burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as good.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\r\n\r\nWycliffe first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Wycliffe joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, learn new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, who wants to help more farmers learn about One Acre Fund.  Wycliffe plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future and buy a cow.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Wycliffe\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, was able to save money and feed the family.\r\n  \t\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.

He is pictured here in a group of nine One Acre Fund lead farmers. The field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo. These group leaders represent a total of 83 individual One Acre Fund farmers who are not pictured here. John has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised. He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\r\n\r\nJohn is married and has nine children. He is 57 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community in groups such as the savings group, prayer group and burial committee. John has been a farmer for 30 years. John described his harvest as excellent last year but believes he can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.\r\n\r\nJohn first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2010 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season. John joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, try new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader and, as an active community member, he wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. John plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to send his children to school and buy a cow. He notes that working with One Acre Fund has led to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers. John\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from his harvest, more farm training, and more farm group support, and he was able to feed the family.\r\n\r\nJohn and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings on to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1489568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to access hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2013-12-14T18:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2014-02-12T18:10:02Z","loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayeku","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roselyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":411873,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411873}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":645184,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is an 18-year-old business woman who is single and living in the Hurungwe District of Zimbabwe.
