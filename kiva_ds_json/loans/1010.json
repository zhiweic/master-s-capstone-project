He is married and has two children aged three and six. He has 1 additional dependent who lives with him to help a younger brother with his education.\n\nIn 2007, Miniru established his provisions, drinks and mobile phone recharge card business.  The business was started after dropping out of school, so as to be self-reliant. His business is located on the outskirts of town and his main customers are adults and passengers. Working 7 days a week and 14 hours a day, he earns about 1,214,000 SLL every month from this business.\n\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Miniru has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans and now requires a new loan in order to add to the stock and expand the trade on mobile phone recharge cards. He hopes that this loan will improve the business and add to the profit. In the future, Miniru plans to move from a wooden kiosk to a concrete shop.

From there she began to design her first creations.\r\n\r\nShe says that she's asking for a loan right now to buy material such as zippers, fabric in different textures and colors, thread, needles, etc.\r\n\r\nShe makes pants, blouses, shirts, nightgowns, sheets, blankets, and many other designs.  She's going to go to Mexico City to stock up because they have lower prices and she'll have enough money to buy all the materials she needs.  In the month of December she has more work because the schools order the costumes for the Pastorela [shepherd's pageant] or the dance shows.\r\n\r\nShe says her goal is to make a big workshop to give people in her town jobs, which is what is most needed to get ahead.

However, little by little they\u2019ve been growing.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\r\nAlberto is requesting a loan to buy more milk, eggs, flour, soft-drinks, oil, etc.  He relates that he has no particular difficulty selling and every time his customers show up at his store he treats them with kindness so that they\u2019ll return with confidence and want to buy.  Alberto and the rest of his family are very happy and grateful to VisionFund and Kiiva for the granted loan because they will be able to invest in their economic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacaria will invest in plastic sales, Hugo will invest in feed and forage for the cattle and Araceli will invest in her clothing sales.  Each one of them has business goals.  What Alberto most wants is that his daughter finishes her professional career and that she will be able to practice it somehow.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":1248234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy stock merchandise for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Concepcion de los Ba\u00f1os, Ixtlahuaca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-12-04T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-03T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1712.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1732.98},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1753.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1774.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1795.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1817.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1839.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1861.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1883.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1905.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1928.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1951.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1975.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1998.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2022.59},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2046.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.72},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.53},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.24},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.47},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.26},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.07},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":963.03,"local_amount":12426.22,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":12439.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068187,"comment":null},{"amount":587.37,"local_amount":7578.99,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":7586.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284926,"comment":null},{"amount":615.98,"local_amount":7948.08,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7956.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199213,"comment":null},{"amount":158.62,"local_amount":2046.71,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T13:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356596009,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-17T01:53:17Z","paid_date":"2013-04-18T13:04:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503398,"name":"Loma Chiquita Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cLoma Chiquita\u201d est\u00e1 compuesto por tres mujeres y un hombre, integrantes que son personas muy trabajadoras y emprendedoras con sus actividades.

If necessary, he also adds chlorine and treats the water to avoid mold and to reduce bacteria. He is currently managing around 90 pools each month. \n\nHis goal is to grow the company by acquiring more contracts and to be able to hire employees to help him. His motivation for his hard work is providing for his family and helping his daughter with college tuition. Marcus is asking for a loan to purchase new equipment.  With new equipment Marcus will be able to employ a greater number of staff therefore increasing the number of contracts that he is able to handle each month.

She has been married to Valent\u00edn for 22 years and together they have formed a family with two children, one of whom is a student.  Julia has made a living for 14 years doing embroidery on napkins, textiles, etc.\r\n\r\nJulia commented: \"I started my job because my children were my motivation.  They were studying, and often there wasn't enough money to pay for all the household expenses.  I had to learn alone; also because my mother embroidered.\"  Her only difficulty is the lack of material because when she has orders to deliver she needs money.  Thanks to the loan from the institution, however, she'll be able to deliver her embroidery on time.\r\n\r\nJulia's goal is for her son to finish his professional program so he can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members are Antonia, Marcelina, and Julia, who also make a living in embroidery.  They comment that this is what they do most in their community because often their handiwork is bought as wedding mementos.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":1248182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy quadrille fabric, yarn, thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Nicolas Guadalupe, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-12-04T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-01-03T01:30:03Z","loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4005.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4157.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4359.94},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4640.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4797.82},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5039.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.51},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.1},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":360.91},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.16},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":311.51,"local_amount":4005.17,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T11:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4023.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332068188,"comment":null},{"amount":323.38,"local_amount":4157.66,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-19T12:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4176.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340284927,"comment":null},{"amount":339.1,"local_amount":4359.94,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T16:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4380.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347199214,"comment":null},{"amount":734.07,"local_amount":9438.45,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T12:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9482.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364663438,"comment":null},{"amount":391.94,"local_amount":5038.78,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5062.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373048883,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-12-04T04:33:03Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T12:54:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":503418,"name":"Eufrocena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eufrocena is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a fish vending business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 260000 through NWTF to buy more fish to sell for her fish vending business.\r\n\r\nEufrocena has been in this business for 20 years.

Rosa lives in her own house along with her husband and her three unmarried children. \r\n\r\nShe makes a living selling cosmetics, perfumes, and female beauty products. Each day she goes out to visit different friends, neighbors, and family members with the hope of selling a perfume, talcum powder, or body cream. Sometimes she also receives customers in her home, since she has a wide glass case where she displays her products for sale. Rosa has been selling cosmetics for nine years. She enjoys working independently without the pressure of working under another person. In addition to these sales, she hopes to begin selling juice and empanadas as well. Over the years in this business, she has learned a lot and developed some of her own sales techniques. \r\n\r\nRosa is very thankful for how well life has been going for her and knows that she must work hard in order to be successful.

She finished high school in a technical school and has worked in several companies for the accounting department. However, economic problems and the fact that she had three small children, made her quit. Karla and her husband decided that she would stay at home, since he works as a coastguard and is away two weeks every month.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, she made a decision, given her economic situation, to invest some capital in a micro-business that is still afloat today. She invested half the money in renting the house and she bought imitation jewelry that she sells in her neighborhood and in different local companies. With the profit she makes, she buys more merchandise.\r\n\r\nKarla wants to expand her business and this is why she went to the Office for Women of Puntarena, where they gave her information about Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer [Foundation Woman]. She wants to increase her capital and buy other types of products to offer her customers and increase her income for supporting her family.\r\n\r\nShe receives 60.000 CRC of child maintenance for her oldest son and the other two are provided for by her current husband. She wants to expand her business knowing that she is well-known in the region. However, she does not make enough money to buy other products that are more valuable, like clothes and trendy purses for women.\r\n\r\nShe is an enterprising woman, used to working and developing her skills. They have improved their quality of life and they bought their own house through a social welfare housing program. Her biggest dream is to have her own establishment, but she takes one step at a time. She needs a small capital in order to diversify her stock and be able to expand her business, which is small but well-known.\r\n\r\nKarla could invest in more merchandise thanks to a loan from KIVA and Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer that she got this year. However, she broke both arms trying to protect her three-year-old child from getting hurt, and could not continue to develop her business. Nevertheless, she continued to pay the debt she had and now that she is back on her feet she is looking again for support in order to continue with her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":778.59,"image":{"id":1076424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

He has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times to start the business, but he hasn't had any success. His loan request was rejected all the time because of his low income and his lack of experience, which local credit providers usually demand. Suren plans to set up meat store locally. \r\n\r\nHis loan request was approved under the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Suren will purchase refrigerators, a mincing-machine and a truck for meat transportation. He will also use the loan to purchase a stock of meat. He has already renovated the store in the town centre. The place is profitable as it is populous, and it does not have a meat store nearby. This will increase sales volume. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of Suren's family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":1248566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to set up a

lives with her life partner and her seven children in their own home and makes a living by purchasing and selling clothing like shirts, pants, and blouses. She has spent several years with this business and this has given her a lot of experience that allows her to get the best earnings. The business is located in a place that qualifies as good for her business activity, which is well-known by the people of the town. She has gotten many customers since the people know that everything is of good quality, at affordable prices, and with unrivaled service it is always to the order and liking of the customers.\r\n\r\nPenninah is an enterprising woman, dedicated to her work, and very hardworking. She pushes herself day in and day out in order to earn a better life and a great success for the future.

She is divorced and has 2 children. She works in a hospital as a nurse in the emergency surgery unit. She is very hard-working, and her colleagues like and respect her. Feruza has always wanted her children to become good, well-qualified workers who can serve their motherland and people. With this goal in mind, she made it possible for her sons to enter university. Currently, her eldest son is in his 3rd year of economics studies at the Russian-Tajik University, and her younger son is in his first year at the Tajikistan State University of Commerce where he is specializing in the customs-related field. Feruza's salary is not sufficient for her to cover the costs of her children's education, and for this reason, she is seeking a loan to pay for their studies. Her hopes are only on you. Let's cooperate to help this caring mother so her children can continue their university education.

and has 2 children. Her life circumstances are tough: her husband has gone to the Russian Federation but is unable send enough money home to provide for the children. Dilorom urgently needs to find a source of income, and for this reason, she took a course entitled \"Get Ahead,\" which was organized by the Association of Businesswomen, and for which she received a certificate.

Their average age is 55 years, they are married, and have an average of five children each.\r\nThis group of women does business in various items such as pagnes (colorful wax cloth), seasoning, beignets, soaps, etc.\r\nTo increase the size of their businesses, the members decided to join the loan program at Soro Yiriwaso. They are on their tenth group loan.\r\nKadiatou is a member of the Koto Allama group. She is the first person seated on the left and sells seasonings.\r\nShe counts on using her loan to buy bags of fakouhoye leaves, near the end of winter when it is less expensive.

the mother of five children. During the Soviet  times, she used to grow produce at a collective farm. As an additional source of income for her family, five years ago she started raising livestock, having launched her business with the starting capital of 80,000 KGS. Thanks to Roza\u2019s hard work, she now has a very developed farm, with a large livestock headcount and a car. Every month,  she earns about 4,000 KGS only from the sales of dairy products. In order to develop her business further, Roza turned to \u201cBai Tushum & Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 70,000 KGS  intended  for the purchase of additional livestock. In the near future, she plans to pay for her son's wedding. Before the wedding, she needs to repair her house and build a shed.

She has 9 children, a fact that earned her the title of \"Mother Heroine\" which was awarded to mothers of large families. She is a calm, kind-hearted and hard-working woman by nature. As the main breadwinner of the family, 17 years ago she began to work in animal husbandry, starting her business with a sum of only 15,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS.) Thanks to Gulkan's hard work and the help of her children, her farm now includes 2 cows and their calves, 15 sheep and 2 horses, and brings in a monthly income of around 12,000 Som from the sale of milk. For the purpose of further developing her business, Gulkan has approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 95,000 Som (KGS) to buy more head of livestock. She plans to use part of the income generated by this loan to expand her farm, and she also dreams of purchasing electrical appliances for her house.

Oksana lives in a home that is heated by a wood-burning stove in the wintertime. She is seeking a loan to buy a gas boiler and pay for its installation.

lives in Gori District.

The source of income for the family is agricultural land, where they grow tomatoes, cabbages and apples. They do all relevant agricultural work to ensure a good quality of harvest. The harvested products are sold seasonally. Alongside this, they run a small dairy farm of two milk cows, whose milk is used in cheese products. The cheese is sold at the local open market. Sopio and Gocha decided to start their business as their existing income wasn't enough for the family and their living conditions are poor. Her loan request was approved in the frame of a new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages the provisions of business start-up and restartup credits with soft conditions to country rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Sopio will purchase a car and her husband will serve to local people as a taxi driver. The income of the family will increase and they will be able to improve the living conditions of the family.

All of the family members work hard, but the income is not enough for covering the everyday expenses. So, John decided to start up a new business. He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, John will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it. John will plant tomatoes and cabbage seeds in his greenhouse and sell the harvested products locally. This will increase his income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

She is 20 years old, not married and lives with her parents. Her parents could not afford to send her to a university, so she has completed a sewing class and learned how to sew traditional women's dresses. Now Mavtuna wants to become a successful business woman and earn income from her craft. She has received a certificate for completing the \"Get Ahead\" course offered by the National Association of Business Women. She can now start a business and become successful in this field. She wants to offer sewing services, because she has experience in this kind of business. Her sewing shop will be close to her house, and her neighbors have already promised to be regular customers since her work is very neat and beautiful. She plans to use her earnings to help parents improve their living conditions. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to buy a sewing machine and materials to establish a new business. She's waiting for your

His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and the lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for country, rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Slava will build a greenhouse. He will purchase building materials and construct it.

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales everyday.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a Php 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to expand her business and dreams of having a good life through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has requested loans from his local financial institutions several times without any success. His loan requests were rejected every time because of low income and a lack of experience in the new job, which is usually demanded by local credit providers. His loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program provides startup and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor who do not have access to credit products since they are regarded as \u201chigh-risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With the loan, Tamaz will cultivate a hectare agricultural land and sow cucumbers and peppers which will increase his income.

Her loan request was always rejected, due to lack of experience in a new business. Experience is usually demanded by local credit providers. Manana requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Her loan request was approved under a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisions providing business start-up and re-startup credits with easier conditions for the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products and are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of low income. With the received credit, Manana will purchase used clothing and sell it from her house among her neighbors. She will begin her entrepreneurial activity with a wide assortment of merchandise and high sales volume. This will increase the family's income. She wants to develop her business further and reinvest the increased income in trading. The new business initiative financed with the Kiva start-up loan will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

But when this happens she immediately takes them to the veterinarian and they recover easily. Mago says \"my goal is to finish building my house so that my children can have a dignified home, but I would also love for them to have successful careers and stable lives without economic struggles.\" For this reason Mago works raising sheep to add one more income to the family. \r\n\r\nGroup members Ren\u00e9 and Roberto will invest their loans in their grocery stores.

She is a widow and a mother to her children. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMagdalena operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round palm sized ones, to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. She also sells dried fish. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials for her business. Part of the loan will be used in buying dried fish. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena hopes to increase production and dreams that her family will be business minded through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

approached MDO Arvand for a loan to increase her herd of cattle. She keeps several head of livestock at home, and this is the main livelihood in the region where she lives. Fattening cattle is her sole source of income. This type of work is currently in demand, which is why her family is working hard at it, so they can support themselves in this way. They have a large family and there is not enough employment for everyone in the village where they live. Many villagers have to go to the Russian Federation to earn money as migrant workers, but Fotima does not want to send any of her family to a foreign country so she is trying to provide for them herself. For this reason, Fotima wants to get a loan from Arvand to buy several head of cattle to continue to develop her business.

She's married and has four children.  Her husband, Davlatali, is a very kind person but he is not able to provide his wife and children with necessities, especially as the children grow and require more.  Rajabgul lived in poverty many years and it was difficult.  With the goal of improving her quality of life, she started her own business sewing women's dresses.  She has a very old sewing machine which breaks frequently and doesn't stitch very well.  Because of this, she has few clients and can't grow her business.  She's planning to buy a new sewing machine to help her new business grow.  She is asking for 500 somonis to buy the machine.  With her revenue, she plans to provide her children with an education and nutritious food.

They live in a quiet community where the majority of people earn their living growing corn.  They selected the group's name from among a number of options; it was the one they liked best.  Lucero, one of the members, tells us that she's thirty-three, and has been married to Zeferino for several years, and together they have two children who are in school.  \r\n\r\nLucero says that, although she was born elsewhere, she came to live in this community. She makes her living raising and selling calves.  She buys them when they are small, raises and cares for them very well, giving them the food they need like corn and feed.  But she often needs to give them vitamins so they don't get sick and die.  She has been in business for seven years, having started out when she came to live with her in-laws.  She loved milking the cows, which she had learned while living with her parents.  Then, thanks to the first loan she received from the Institution, she decided to buy her first calf.  Although her in-laws had sheep, she didn't pay much attention because it was her dream to have calves.\r\n\r\nShe says, \"I really love cows and milking.  However, the hard part is when they get sick and oftentimes don't recover, and die.  It's an enormous loss of income, and I would like to get some kind of training so I can care for my animals better.\"  Difficulties aside, Lucero wants the business to keep growing so she can improve the corral; if the cow are doing well they'll produce.  Lucero is hoping that this will provide good security for her and her husband in their old age, and that their children will get professional degrees so they can have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group have their own businesses, just like Lucero:  Ana Lilia and Vanessa will invest in their grocery store; Francisca and Roc\u00edo will invest in candy; Aurelia will buy sheep; Elena will invest in clothing and shoes; Josefina will buy chickens; and Margarita will buy bulls.  All the women in the group have a great desire make their families succeed.  They are very grateful to the Institution and to Kiva for the loan because it has been a big help in allowing them to improve their families' quality of life.
