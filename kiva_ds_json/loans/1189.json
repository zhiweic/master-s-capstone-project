He is a popular chef who often caters special events and recently has seen an increase in business since his return from culinary training in Italy.\r\n\r\nHis original and zesty mixes are low in salt, his plum and lemon flavors have zero salt, and all spice mixes are free of MSG, gluten, preservatives, additives and dyes.  In addition to offering these seasonings for sale, he uses them to liven up his catered offerings of baked, grilled, saut\u00e9ed and smoked meats, as well as stir-fried and steamed vegetables.  \r\n\r\nLawrence\u2019s main goal is to create seasonings that are both delicious and healthful, offering everybody tasty options \u2013 even people who must follow restricted diets.  \r\n\r\nSince 2000, Lawrence has sold his products at Williams-Sonoma in Sugar Land, Texas, where he resides, and he regularly sells at the Farmer\u2019s Market at Imperial, also in Sugar Land.

She is the featured borrower member for Gamthum Group. At 30 years old, Lhingneikim is married with six kids and lives in a village with her husband. The rest of the group members also live in the same village close to one another. The village is about 40 km away from the city capital of Imphal, which is also one of the state capitals for the north-eastern states of India. Her husband and she work side by side to meet the needs of the family. Her husband rears cattle, feeds them, and does businesses to generate income. She grows vegetables on the hill-slopes in the village and sells them to women selling vegetables at the town market. \r\n\r\nLhingneikim is a farmer who supplements the family income by selling vegetables, grown by her on the distant hill-slopes in the village. She grows beans, cabbage, cauliflower, ladyfingers, pumpkins, yams, chives, potatoes, and spring onions. She also grows local vegetables found only in the states and eaten only by the local people. Although her main business is growing vegetables and supplying vegetables to the women vendors, most of the time she is busy raising cows. She feeds them, cut their fodder, bathes them, vaccinates them, and milks them. The investment in raising cattle is more profitable than selling vegetables, shares Lhingneikim. Therefore, she decided to spend more time raising cattle in addition to growing vegetables. She will be engaged in both activities now.\r\n\r\nShe wants loan from Kiva to purchase a calf and raise it. Luck favors them both, Lhingneikim and her husband, when raising cattle. The cattle are taken to the nearby field to eat grass and, when they are fully grown, they are sold in the village as well as in the neighbouring villages. She also sells the milk and generates income. \r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the support and will remain obliged for the kind gesture. She will also repay the loan on time and try hard to be financially independent. Last but not least, she says, \u201cThank you, Kiva\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in piggery, weaving, and selling vegetables."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1403513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase a calf, raise it, and use it for other purposes to generate income for the family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Motbung","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T15:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T15:00:09Z","loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nengkhovah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemneichong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneithem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimhoivah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngahneilhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhainei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T18:01:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593292,"name":"Serah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Serah lives in Nanyuki, Kenya.

While he is an experienced farmer, he also runs a grocery shop and has been looking for new business opportunities. He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to over 300 households in his community.\n\nThe maize milling machine takes raw maize (white corn) and creates a maize flour which is used to make the staple food in Zambia. Most families in Chrispin\u2019s community grow maize on their small farm, drying and storing it to be used as their source of food throughout the year. After the maize kernels are removed from the cob, they have to be milled to create flour. The flour is then boiled in water to make what is locally called Nshima.\n\nRent-to-Own has worked with Chrispin to thoroughly understand the market potential for a maize milling service in his community. Chrispin\u2019s proposed location for the maize mill is ideal, as the closest competitor is 14km away, and since most members of the community, and others that are nearby, walk or take their maize to the mill by bicycle, it is certain they will prefer to use Chrispin\u2019s mill rather than traveling a longer distance.\n\nEquipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost, not only for rural business owners such as Chrispin, but also for the community as a whole. Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill can be very prohibitive. Once Chrispin secures a loan he will be able to get a maize mill from Rent-to-Own. Rent-to-Own will deliver the mill to his place of business, install it, and provide training on how to use and maintain it. With a maize mill, Chrispin will be able to diversify his business and better serve his community.\n\nThis loan will help Chrispin establish a profitable service in his community that will support his family and the members of his community throughout the year. It is for this reason Chrispin is asking Kiva lenders to help him with the loan so that he can secure a maize mill as soon as possible.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":799.96,"image":{"id":1410648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for a maize milling machine that will provide a food milling service to over 300 families in his community","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kabwe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":281,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chrispin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":13200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2013-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":770},{"due_date":"2014-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5810}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":371.21},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.92},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1078.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":371.21,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410397985,"comment":null},{"amount":142.92,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T20:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419962082,"comment":null},{"amount":142.92,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T21:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429616076,"comment":null},{"amount":142.91,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-17T14:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439841793,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T13:47:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":594674,"name":"Noupagagnon I Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les 10 membres du groupe   NOUPAGAGNON I sont des hommes mari\u00e9s  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 42 ans, 7 enfants et vivant tous dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 TOUROUMADIE, un des villages de SIKASSO, 3\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nIls collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nIls sont \u00e0 leur deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution et le pr\u00eat pass\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  le ma\u00efs avec  NAFANGA  assise en premi\u00e8re  position de la  droite vers la gauche, il compte acheter avec son pr\u00eat, des intrants, la semence et payer les frais de labour pour entretenir  1 hectare. \nLa production est vendue au niveau du village, au march\u00e9 de SIKASSO apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes.

She has three children, whom she raised and educated. For more than 25 years, Manzura has been engaged in producing flatbreads for subsequent sale. After she got married, she needed to help her husband to earn money. As we all know, the 90s were a very complex time and it was impossible to survive on her husband's small income. \r\n\r\nIn Manzura's words, that time began a streak in her life -- her husband was seriously ill. In parallel, she was working in bakery shops while nursing her husband and raising the children. After a long period of illness, Manzura's husband passed away. Manzura had to work around the clock without food and without sleep because she had debts to suppliers for flour and pressing needs. But a mother's love for her children gave her extra strength. Her work has not gone in vain; she was able to collect savings, pay off debts, and offer her two daughters in marriage. \r\n\r\nNow the time has come to think about putting on a wedding for her son.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to expand her business and working capital, so she is requesting a loan of 12,000 somoni to buy flour for working capital. She is applying for a loan for the first time and plans to repay it with the proceeds from the bakery shop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297.98,"image":{"id":1407076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to buy flour for increasing her working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Zafarabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.598056 68.977778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T16:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T16:10:07Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":327.06},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":338.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":349.66},{"due_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":385.61},{"due_date":"2014-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":374.64},{"due_date":"2014-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":387.36},{"due_date":"2014-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":432.87},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":404.92},{"due_date":"2014-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":448.71},{"due_date":"2014-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":444.23},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":459.32},{"due_date":"2014-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":483.31},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":475.64},{"due_date":"2014-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":529.49},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":518.74},{"due_date":"2014-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":543.12},{"due_date":"2015-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":572.74},{"due_date":"2015-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":581.02},{"due_date":"2015-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":613.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":621.61},{"due_date":"2015-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":645.7},{"due_date":"2015-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":660.15},{"due_date":"2015-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":691.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":710.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.82},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.57},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.51},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.08},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.42},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.47},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.7},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.08},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.41},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.15},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.28},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.52},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.26},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.13},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.8},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.87},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107.62,"local_amount":511.44,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-21T09:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":513.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400550546,"comment":null},{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":168.44,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T09:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420075645,"comment":null},{"amount":73.68,"local_amount":350.16,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":351.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430228307,"comment":null},{"amount":81.24,"local_amount":386.1,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":387.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":439989268,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-17T14:25:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593311,"name":"Raquel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raquel is married and has four children.

In particular, they cultivate land where maize is grown. Beka also produces hay which is used for feeding his livestock: a cow and a pig.  Beka works hard all day long and wishes to get ahead.\r\nSeveral times, he has requested loans from local financial institutions in order to start up trading business, but without any success. His loan requests were rejected because of lack of experience in the business, which is usually demanded by local financial institutions. His loan request has now been approved in the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. This start-up loan program envisages the provision of business start-up and re-start-up credit, with soft conditions to country's vulnerable poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as 'high-risk borrowers' because of low income. \r\nWith the received credit, Beka plans to purchase clothing and household items from wholesalers in the capital city open market and then sell these items from his house. After investing the funds in his business, Beka hopes to generate additional revenue and invest the profits to further develop his business. Beka\u2019s grandmother will assist him for running the business. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":351.94,"image":{"id":1406366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to start trading in clothing and household items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Gelati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2013-08-15T16:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-09-14T16:20:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.27},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.97},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.41},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.74},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.22},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.76},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.34},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.21},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.47},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.06},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.32},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.58},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.55},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.22},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.76},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.93},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.38},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.15},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.37},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.32,"local_amount":117.27,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":120.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399857646,"comment":null},{"amount":66.58,"local_amount":107.97,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T16:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":110.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410134319,"comment":null},{"amount":69.27,"local_amount":112.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-18T10:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":115.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420107900,"comment":null},{"amount":70.55,"local_amount":114.41,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T10:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":117.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430255434,"comment":null},{"amount":73.22,"local_amount":118.74,"processed_date":"2013-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-18T10:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":121.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":440019564,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-08-21T14:54:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":593313,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mario is a married man with a child.

years old, married, and the mother of many children. She has four children (one daughter and three sons). She has a high school education. After graduating from high school, Jyparkul got married at quite a young age. Since 1997, she has been involved in agriculture - raising animals and crops - starting with a sum of 15,000 som KGS. Jyparkul's husband helps her around the farm. \r\n\r\nThanks to the hard work and patient nature of Jyparkul, she today has a good farm: three dairy cows and ten sheep. She also has available 3.0 hectares of irrigated land, on which she grows beans annually. Profits allowed Jyparkul to propagate livestock on her homestead and thus to improve the family's well-being. In order to further develop her homestead, Jyparkul turned to the microfinance bank Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000 som (KGS) to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nJyparkul plans to invest income from the loan to further increase the number of livestock, and also intends to do repairs on the home in which she lives with her

She has a college degree and works as an accountant in telecommunications.  By character, Burulkan is calm, balanced, and hard-working.  Her spouse and children help her with her business.  As a source of extra income for the family, for many years Burulkan has worked with livestock.  She started the business with 15,000 KGS.  Thanks to her hard work and care, today she has one dairy cow and 15 sheep.  She also has a plot of land where she grows clover, beans and corn.  This business brings in around 9,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and dairy products, as well as vegetables which cover most of the family's food costs.  This income allowed Burulkan to give her children a good education.  With the goal of further developing her business, Burulkan turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy bulls and sheep.  She plans to use the income from the loan to further invest in her farm and also, in the future, to marry her son.

lives in the Ndaragwa area of Kenya, which has one of the cooler climates in Kenya. She has 5 children and has been doing this work for 16 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and crops.\r\n\r\nShe stated what is most enjoyable about farming: 'Selling milk.' Her biggest challenge is 'Feeding the animals.' Animals on the farm have been given the names of 'Nguno the cow.'\r\n\r\nRose was asked why she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan, to which she replied: 'They deliver their services to farmers' doorsteps.'  This client was also asked what was learned during Juhudi's required micro-finance training session: 'Group guarantee enables one to get a loan with less security.'\r\n\r\nHer highest monthly expense is school fees.

She is the light in the lives of her kids and their only hope.  Twenty years ago, she started her own business selling women's and men's footwear at a local market.  She has her own space where she sells her goods.  She mostly sells to women since the demand is higher than it is for men's and children's shoes.

Her spouse works as a taxi driver in their village.  She herself is a homemaker.  However, lifestock is their main source of income.  Since 2002, they have worked with animals, having started the business with 10,000 KGS.  Suyunduk is hardworking and friendly.  Today she has one dairy cow, two bulls and one horse.  Her business brings in around 12,000 KGS a month from the sale of milk and, with the income from her husband, it covers most of the family's food costs.  With the goal of further expanding their farming efforts, Suyunduk turned to the microfinance bank Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 30,000 KGS to buy a bull.  She plans to us the income from the loan to further invest in the farm and also, in the future, to provide her children with a worthy education.

Cielo divided her time between her job and one of her favorite hobbies, making knitted and embroidered crafts.  She learned this skill by taking a high school course and developed a passion that she has always had ever since.  Five years ago, Cielo decided to become independent and establish her own business of making all types of knitted and embroidered garments.  Her business is located in a small space in her house that doubles as both a workshop and a store.  In addition to clothes, she also sells baby products.  \r\n<p>\r\nCielo is a successful, enterprising, and intelligent woman who is passionate about what she does.  She says that she accomplished one of her important dreams, which was to open her own business.  Now her challenge is to expand her business by increasing her clientele and exporting her garments to other countries.  For this reason, Cielo is requesting a loan.  She will invest in repairs to her knitting machine and the purchase of a necessary spare part so that she can continue her business.

This has been her business for the last seven years. She is a 37-year-old married mother of one child. She also sells laptops as a separate business. Her vision in the next five years is to be operating a wholesale shop. She knew Milango through friends and now she seeks a loan to buy handbags, clothes and shoes for sale. The major challenge in the business for Grace is competition from other traders and clients not paying in time. The extra income that she will raise from the business will help her pay school fees for her children and improve her living

Several years ago, as the result of an earthquake their house was greatly shattered.

lives in Vanadzor town with his father. To financially support the family, Karen's mother went to a neighboring country for finding a job. Karen has been already three years involved in selling cloth and dressmaking supplies to locals in the town. Over these years of hard and tireless work, he has already formed a group of loyal customers. \r\n\r\nFor purchasing new stock of inventory, Karen needs financial support.

After classes, she would work at a bread factory to earn money to support her family. After graduating from college, she started teaching at a high school. She got married and gave birth to an invalid daughter. She got divorced, and remarried. Her husband left to work in Russia, and worked there for two years. After returning home, he began working raising livestock and as an electrician. His thoughtful wife helps him run the business. She fattens the livestock so they can be sold. They use the income to treat their daughter. They also support her husband's parents. On their income, they cannot afford to support the family and pay for their son's college.

She earns her living in agriculture and has a large plot of 12 hectares on which she plants different varieties of seeds.  She has 8 hectares of cacao and 4 of bananas, citrus and corn.  The land was passed down from her parents, who divided it equally between her and her siblings.  Olga also has 4 more hectares on which she hopes to plant additional crops.  At first she worked by herself, but she gets help now from her husband and eventually from other people once the size of the harvest increases.  \r\n\r\nOlga says she likes country life.  She has learned to endure the rhythm of work and knows how to get the job done because she learned from her parents when she was very young.  She assures us, however, that physical fatigue is incessant because the work requires a great deal of effort.  In spite of that she is fully satisfied with the income she makes because it allows her the money she needs give her family a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nAt this time Olga is requesting a loan of 3000 soles.  She is so excited to know that there are people who will provide economic support for her to continue her work.  She promises to be a responsible and punctual member.  She'll invest her loan in the purchase of organic fertilizer and certified seeds so she can plant another hectare of cacao.

It would like your help to improve sales and marketing of its artisans\u2019 creations and provide income for rural Albanian women. Aida is the social entrepreneur who founded Rozafa. Up until now she has been a one-woman operation. With Rozafa growing, she needs some help. Aida appears in the video along with some of the women artisans.\n\nAlbania is still struggling to find its way after enduring 50 years of communist dictatorship. The country is the 4th poorest in Europe, with a strong tradition of patriarchy, and it is especially difficult for mothers and elderly women from rural areas to find work. At the same time, the villages are oases of traditional Albanian handicraft skills passed down from generation to generation; among the types of handicrafts created are hand-woven carpets, traditional tribal clothing, embroidery, loom weaving, hand knitting, tailoring crafts, rugs, metal furniture and metal filigree. Unfortunately, due to lack of access to broader consumer markets from both information and geographic isolation, sales of these products is rapidly declining. With no reason or means to continue producing, women are no longer passing these skills along to the next generation; the survival of an ancient handcrafting tradition and the livelihoods of women artisans are threatened.\n\nBy setting up training workshops in Albania, and organizing sales and distribution of handicrafts domestically and abroad, Rozafa brings stable employment and income to more than 120 women in rural areas, enabling the preservation of the skills and culture of traditional handcrafts. Rozafa makes available training and equipment for the women working in the workshops, processes orders from trade clients, and buys the handicrafts at a fair price. It acts as a bridge between individual workshops and customers. Product quality is high and suitable for export, and customers range from Western European interior design stores, expat Albanian families, to the Albanian hospitality industry and tourists in Tirana. \n\nRight now, however, Rozafa\u2019s success is hindered by unpredictable demand; limited ability to assess market trends; and excess capacity. YSB has been enlisted to help Rozafa grow by creating and executing a sales and marketing strategy to target lucrative trade clients in Albania and abroad. \n\nYour loan will be used by Rozafa to develop a market-oriented product portfolio, to create a robust, world-class brand, to provide logistical aid and micro-lending for the workshops, and to develop a new sales strategy (including networking with a wider range of distribution channels and establishing a strong online presence through a brand-new website). Your Kiva loan will contribute towards the first year\u2019s salary of a Sales Manager who will be fully dedicated to developing Rozafa\u2019s commercial presence and achieving its full potential.\n\nAida and YSB are very glad that you have taken the time to read about Rozafa. Join YSB in creating more opportunities for Albania\u2019s rural women and preserving the skills and culture of traditional handcrafts."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":23950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1406440,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2877,"youtubeId":"mcJmeQQdJZ4","title":"Kiva

They\u2019ve succeeded in moving their children forward and only have two of the younger ones still in their care.  One of them works to help his parents and the other attends university thanks to Juan\u2019s sacrifice so that his story won\u2019t be repeated with his children.\r\n\r\nHe works growing basic grains.  He remembers learning alongside his father who would take him along when he was still little.  He remembers that he bought him a small machete that he\u2019d amuse himself with in the beginning but gradually he learned and started to become interested in doing things well so that when he grew up he\u2019d be able to work as a day laborer and earn his own money.  Today, he must walk 500 meters to the spot where his crops grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy supplies (fertilizer and herbicide) to provide adequate nutrition to his crop and to prepare the soil to plant beans.  Thanks to support from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, this will cover the need he has of providing good crop maintenance in order to obtain the expected crop yields\r\n\r\nIn future, Juan plans to request another loan at the beginning of the planting season to provide better care to his cornfield and control the pests that can cause crop losses and if necessary take out a loan so that his son can complete his studies.

At his store, you can receive shoe and boot repairs, leather repairs, and purchase polish and other shoe-care products. Originally from Jalisco, Mexico, Primitivo enjoys Corpus and life here in the United States.\n\nPrimitivo learned about Accion Texas Inc. from an Accion employee. The Accion representative explained the many loan programs offered by the nonprofit organization. Once he applied and received his $4,375 Accion loan, Primitivo began using the loan to purchase additional inventory supplies and a shoe stretcher, and upgrade existing equipment. \n\nWithout the loan, Primitivo would not have been able to accept more customers and give them a quick turnaround on their repairs.  The loan helped him do this and increase his revenue.

He grows sugarcane for local gin brewing but on a small scale and this is affecting his income from the project.\r\n\r\nKatende has now requested a loan of 2,000,000 (Two million Uganda shillings) so that he can buy more land to expand on his sugarcane plantation.

He\u2019s a person who has worked hard so that his family would have everything they need and so that his three children can have a home, health and education.  His wife does the housework and cares for the little ones seeing to their welfare and adequate nutrition.  Two of his children attend school and also earmark some of their time to help their parents with household chores.\r\n\r\nHe is a humble, hardworking man who works growing corn, beans and sorghum.  He learned this activity from his father while still very little since he\u2019s one of his parents\u2019 older children.  He remembers that his father bought him a machete to take him along and teach him how to clear the cornfield; he\u2019d rise at dawn and work every day.  His father would tell him to learn to work to earn a living and to set a good example for his younger siblings.\r\n\r\nLater, since deciding to form his own family he\u2019s worked growing basic grains.  Today, he teaches his children to farm so that in future they can develop work skills; he also gives them space so that they can study and develop skills so that in future they won\u2019t have to work in agriculture but also be able to carry out other kinds of work.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy building supplies to repair his roof at home because the wood and the metal sheeting need to be replaced because they have holes in them.  In this way he hopes to improve his and his family\u2019s quality of life so that rain water won\u2019t drop any longer on the children while they sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen this loan is paid off he\u2019ll see if he can take out another one to add another room to his house so that he can have more, better organized, space.

It currently brings together more than 3000 members and is mostly made up of men and women based in the different regions of Senegal. The creation of this economic interest group has as its goal to permit its members to run agricultural and fishing production businesses, general import-export, transportation, industrial, artisanal, construction, livestock farming, mining, transport, hydrocarbon cultivation, art, culture, printing, woodworking service, charitable activities, performance, fishing product conversion, agricultural, spare parts sales, glass fabrication, bakery and service provision businesses.
