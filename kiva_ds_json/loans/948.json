Los productos los traslada en su cami\u00f3n y los almacena en su bodega; para posteriormente sus empleados los trasladan a la finca carg\u00e1ndolos en su espalda. \n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en la construcci\u00f3n de una galera para guardar sus veh\u00edculos y para la compra de 10 sacos de abono. Con la construcci\u00f3n de la galera, proteger\u00e1 sus veh\u00edculos del sol y la lluvia, se ahorrara en mantenimiento, ya que la pintura se deteriora y los empaques, etc. Adem\u00e1s que le brindara a su plantaci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9 los fertilizantes que necesita obteniendo cada vez mejores resultados. \n\n","en":"Manuel, 45, is married and has four children.  He has worked in coffee production for 25 years.  For five years he has had a truck he uses for himself and to transport other people.  He always has done this work, which he learned from his family.\r\n\r\nHe gets the products he needs in a coffee co-op about 20 minutes from his house.  Other times he goes farther, to another city about an hour and twenty minutes away.  He transports the products in his truck and stores them in his cellar.  Later his employees carry them to the farm on their backs.\r\n\r\nHe'll use the loan to build a covered area to store his vehicles and to buy 10 sacks of fertilizer.  By building this he'll protect his vehicles from the sun and rain, and save in maintenance costs because of the deterioration of paint, seal, etc.  In addition, he'll treat his coffee farm with the necessary fertilizer, getting better results all the time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1190943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She started this business 12 years ago with a sum of only 1,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS).

married and has two children.  To provide the primary source of income for her family, she has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 20 years, having started this business with 1,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Kalybu's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and three horses, and the monthly profit from the business amounts to about 17,000 som (KGS).  She also works on three hectares of land, growing clover, used for livestock feed, and vegetables - potatoes, pumpkins and onions.  In order to further develop her business, Kalybu requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow in order to increase milk volumes.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into developing her business by buying additional livestock, so that she could hold a wedding for her youngest son upon his return from the

She has been involved in animal husbandry farming since 1996, having started this business practically with nothing.  Thanks to Bubinazira's hard work, today her business contains two dairy cows with offspring and 0.90 hectares of her own land and 1.0 hectare of leased land with watermelons, corn and cotton.  Thanks to the business earnings, she was able to hold a wedding for her son and prepare a dowry for her daughter.  In order to further develop her business, Bubinazira requested a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a dairy cow in order to increase earnings from milk production.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into further increasing domestic livestock quantities in order to pay for her younger daughters' education at a university.

All of her merchandise is brought from the city and she sells it at competitive prices. She has been able to earn her customers' preference and they recommend her to other people, which increases her customer base and makes her store a very busy location.\r\n\r\nShe started out over two years ago. It was her partner's idea and she had her own capital, but he supported her by tending to the business in his time off.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business is quite profitable because there is high demand for her products, her prices are fair, and the total vehicle stock is on the rise as well. \r\n\r\nBefore she started her business she didn't have her own income, wich is why she decided to find work and generate her own financial earnings. That would also allow her to help her partner realize their plans of buying a home.

de 63 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y empe\u00f1osa, adem\u00e1s de ser alegre y cordial en su trato con las personas. Est\u00e1 casada con M\u00e1ximo quien es comerciante y padre de sus hijos quienes ya son mayores e independientes. Juntos habitan c\u00f3modamente su propia casa. La actividad que realiza Julia es la comercializaci\u00f3n de abarrotes, art\u00edculos de librer\u00eda, medicamentos y otros, para esto abri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a bodega en su propia casa, desde donde atiende las necesidades de sus vecinos, quienes son sus principales clientes, a los que atiende muy amablemente. Tambi\u00e9n vende golosinas y bebidas gasificadas en su bodega.\nSe inici\u00f3 hace m\u00e1s de 8 a\u00f1os logrando hacerse muy conocida por las zonas que oferta sus productos y hasta el momento lo viene realizando sola.\nConsidera su negocio rentable porque casi siempre acaba todo lo que lleva para vender, dej\u00e1ndole buenas ganancias. Antes de empezar con su negocio ten\u00eda dificultades econ\u00f3micas ya que los alimentos suben  de precios constantemente y los ingresos de su esposo no les alcanzaban para cubrir todos sus gastos, por eso quiso apoyarlo gener\u00e1ndose sus propios ingresos econ\u00f3micos.\nPor tanto, viendo lo bien que le resulta su negocio, desea continuar y mantenerlo. Este es el pr\u00e9stamo n\u00famero 13 con la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Por tanto cuenta con  un peque\u00f1o pr\u00e9stamo para que pueda cumplir con sus objetivos. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s de cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9dito que tuvo. Tambi\u00e9n comenta que se siente a gusto con banco comunal pues lo considera un grupo unido y solidario.\nCon el monto solicitado de 1200 nuevos soles, lo invertir\u00e1 en su negocio comprando abarrotes en general como arroz, az\u00facar, aceites, entre otros, y golosinas, buscando aumentar su capital con las ganancias de las ventas, por eso espera conseguir precios c\u00f3modos por sus compras en volumen.\n\n","en":"Julia, 63, is a hardworking, enterprising woman besides being cheerful and treating others kindly.  She\u2019s married to M\u00e1ximo who is a merchant and the father of their children who are all independent adults now.  They all live comfortably in their own house.  \r\n \r\nJulia\u2019s activity is selling groceries, stationery supplies, medicine and others.  To do so, she opened a small home-based store where she tends to her neighbors\u2019 needs who are her main customers and who she tends to kindly.  She also sells sweets and carbonated beverages in her store.  She started more than 8 years ago and has succeeded in making herself very well-known in the areas because of her product offerings; to date she\u2019s been working alone.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable because she almost always sells out everything she brings to sell earning good profits.  Before starting her business she had economic difficulties because the price of food constantly rises and her husband\u2019s income was insufficient to cover all expenses and that\u2019s why she wanted to help him by earning income of her own.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, seeing the good results her business has, she wants to continue and keep it in operation.  This will be MFP loan #13 so she now has a small loan to be able to reach her objectives.  She commits once more to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with her previous loans.  She also comments that she feels comfortable in her communal bank because she considers it to be a united, supportive group.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1200 new soles to invest in her business buying groceries in general like rice, sugar and oil, among others and also sweets hoping to increase her capital though profits from sales.  She therefore hopes to get good prices because of her volume purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1192512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"  to buy rice, sugar, oil and sweets, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-18T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-18T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":191.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":205.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":217.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.77,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452388,"comment":null},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":191.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":197.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447578,"comment":null},{"amount":75.45,"local_amount":190.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":196.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053476,"comment":null},{"amount":81.37,"local_amount":205.57,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":212.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188414,"comment":null},{"amount":84.4,"local_amount":213.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":220.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572333,"comment":null},{"amount":86.28,"local_amount":217.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":225.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121996,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-23T09:11:33Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472236,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of two children, Emma works hard to support her family.\r\n\r\nShe has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from charcoal retail.

Her motivation is to work and to offer them the best quality of life.\r\n\r\nLiz makes a living selling pharmacy products and other health products from a drugstore that she opened in a specially-created area of her own house, which saves on rent.  She started the business more than 5 years ago and relies on her husband who supported her with the capital she needed to buy the necessary merchandise for her neighbors in the area, where they often cannot count on the medicine needed for their ailments.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable due to strong earnings and regular clientele.  Before starting the business, she found herself in financial straits, as her family grew very rapidly with the arrival of triplets and expenses exceeded her income.  She looked for a solution and decided on this business which right now is going well and has eliminated many of her financial difficulties.  For this reason, she has plans to continue with the business and buy more merchandise so that she will have available inventory to sell.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she can count on the line of credit to advance her business.  For this reason she promises to complete her payments and have a good credit record so that she will have more access to credit in the future.  She also says that she feels good about the work of her communal bank and for the support they offer to people who need it.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she is asking (1200 nuevos soles), she will invest in the purchase of pharmacy products like medicine, pills and others, seeking out the best wholesale prices so she can offer her customers the lowest prices and support their needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1192492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"to buy pharmacy products such as medicines and pills.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-18T22:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-18T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":191.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":190.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":205.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":213.23},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":217.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.4},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":71.77,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452385,"comment":null},{"amount":75.73,"local_amount":191.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":197.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447574,"comment":null},{"amount":75.45,"local_amount":190.59,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":196.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323053472,"comment":null},{"amount":81.37,"local_amount":205.57,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":212.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331188410,"comment":null},{"amount":84.4,"local_amount":213.23,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":220.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339572329,"comment":null},{"amount":86.28,"local_amount":217.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T14:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":225.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347121992,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

As a hardworking young man, Ever's main dream is to get ahead and create a better future for himself. He makes a living as a taxi driver transporting passengers between districts. The commute usually takes half an hour, so Ever likes to make sure his passengers are comfortable during the ride by playing music or chatting with them. He has been working as a taxi driver for five years now (since he was 19), and he really enjoys his work. Thanks to his parents and money he had worked to save, Ever was able to buy his own car for transporting his passengers. Typically, during the evening hours (between 8:00 and 9:00 at night), there aren't many passengers looking for a ride, so Ever often has to wait longer to make trips with even two customers. Sometimes, he has to wait until the next day to continue working.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 nuevos soles of support from this, his first loan, Ever plans to purchase replacement parts for his car, so that he can continue with his taxi business. His dream is to eventually buy another vehicle to expand his operation.

He has 23 years' worth of experience in repairing and painting vehicles. He learned this trade because he started working in an auto repair shop as an assistant, since he was very young and unfamiliar with it. However, later on he learned the business very well and set up his own shop where he employs young people who wish to learn the trade.\r\nThe loan he requests from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo is to purchase eight gallons of putty, two gallons of paint, electrodes, saws, discs, among other items. With the loan Don Juan will be able to buy the supplies in bulk, so that he can get more accessible prices. He'll also save time by not having to travel so often to the town where he buys the supplies. Besides, with the supplies in his shop Don Juan will be able to tackle any job that comes in, because he'll have the supplies to do it. His goal is to build a larger shop and get protection from the

She is a 32-year-old mother of two children, both of whom are dependent on her and still in school. She has been farming rice for eight years to support her family and also supplements the family\u2019s income by selling desserts in the local area. Her current business earns her around 32,000 Cambodian riels (KHR) per day, which she uses to meet her family's needs. The main challenge for her field business is low crop yields.\r\n\r\nSopheap has been with VisionFund for one cycle, while the other member has been with VisionFund for four cycles.

Lucita is married to Rodeo and a mother to her children. She and her husband manage their household while operating the business. At this time, Lucita is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLucita maintains a direct-selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through popular direct-sales brands such as Avon, Fuller Life, Natasha, Boardwalk, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. In direct selling, the dealer buys the customer's order in cash and then gives it to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, hence the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Lucita also has a tailoring business making pillow cases and bed sheets. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy orders for her customers and expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLucita hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams of having a good life for her family.

canteen of a local school. Since 1996, she has been growing crops and raising livestock as a means of supplementing her salary. She started this business with only 6,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS). Thanks to her persistent hard work, Seinebpu now has 2 dairy cows, 2 calves, 12 sheep and 4 goats. She also has 1.6 hectares of land where she grows corn, clover and wheat. The income Seinebpu has earned has allowed her to pay to send her son to the capital city for his studies. \r\n\r\nSeinebpu approached Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 Kyrgyzstan Som (KGS) to develop her business. She will use the money to purchase young livestock to fatten and re-sell. Seinebpu plans to use the income generated by this loan to re-invest in her business. She wants to buy more cattle in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":537.5,"image":{"id":1197993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uch -Terek village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T04:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T04:20:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seinepbu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2014-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":537.5},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":645}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10081.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754788,"comment":null},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15122.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-28T01:09:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472299,"name":"Gilbert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gilbert runs a video show business to earn a living.

Among her six kids, she can afford to keep two daughters in school while the remaining four help the family business. They also produce sugar from sugar palm trees in order to assist their mother (Heak) with their basic daily needs. \r\n\r\nHeak and her husband manage their two-hectare (about 20,000 square meters) of farmland for rice crop cultivation to help their big family survive. Heak has been involved in this business for 25 years and earns about 26000 KHR. Her main challenges are water supply shortages and insufficiency of working capital to support her rice farm, especially the cost of harvesting fees. Therefore, Heak formed a group of two women to seek a new loan; she is in the third cycle while her co-member is in the second cycle with Kiva's partner.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully repaying a loan, Heak feels confident that she can sustain her family's living condition as well as her business. For this cycle, she and her fellow group member are seeking the same loan amount: 1000000 KHR each. As the group leader, she will use her loan portion to pay a harvesting fee and buy fertilizer for her rice field. She hopes to gain more yield and sell at a higher price so she can keep her children in school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1194603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay a harvesting fee and buy fertilizer for her rice field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Pursat Province, Kror Kor district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T04:30:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Heak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2013-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1014250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265936,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1014250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381837829,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T19:42:34Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:04:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472303,"name":"Margaret   Wanjiru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 60 years old and is married with four children.

He has experience as a driver, because he needed to drive cars and trucks in the countryside. He has since moved, with his parents, to the center of the province. \r\n\r\nNow he plans to his open a transportation business and he has decided to purchase a truck. In Mongolia it is possible to buy a truck for 7,000,000 MNT. He has sold his livestock for 4,000,000 MNT, but he still needs a 3,000,000 MNT loan to purchase the truck.

It has been 10 years since she has engaged in this business, and it earns her about KHR 25,000 per day. For Nhean, the main challenge for her business is low crop production due to the unpredictable weather issue, pests, and the declining price of corn. The past loan was her first loan with VisionFund (Kiva's partner). After the successful loan that has sustained a good living condition for her especially in providing decent food for her children, she has paid back the entire loan. Now, she is a leader in a group of two female members. She and her co-member are seeking the same loan amount of KHR 1,000,000 each. For her loan portion, she will use it to buy seeds, fertilizer, and insecticides for her crops. She expects a larger yield and to receive a high profit so as she can keep supporting all of her children in

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMerly hopes to grow her business and dreams of sending all her children to school through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1194665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T08:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T08:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":2799.99,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2904.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308114748,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":4667.01,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4840.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315350800,"comment":null},{"amount":93.33,"local_amount":3732.96,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3871.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322959906,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":2800.04,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2904.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331094619,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T10:47:47Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:32:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472349,"name":"Muthuku   Ndambuki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muthuku is 52 years old, married, and with five children who are in school.

She and her fellow group member are taking a loan of 500,000 KHR and 300,000 KHR, respectively. As a group leader, she will use her portion buy four sacks of fertilizer for the rice field and use a small portion of it to buy a traditional flour mill for her dessert-selling business. She expects to maximize income from the current business so she will not only be able to upgrade her standard of living but also to save some money to buy a mini-tractor for her farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1194667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy four

She began her business after the war because she had no money and needed a way to feed her children.\r\n \r\nMariama runs a cookery business from her house; she sells local food like beans rice, cassava leaf rice and pure water. She has been running this business for nine years. She works at the business every day. She starts preparing the food at 4:30am and doesn't rest until the food is finished. Her other source of income comes from the sales of palm oil. At present she is faced with a problem of insufficient capital to run her business.\r\n\r\nMariama has requested a loan in order to buy more cooking items such as bags of rice, Maggie, salt and vegetable oil. The extra income from this loan will allow her to expand her cookery business. In the future, she plans to open a restaurant.

For the past eight years Eva has had a small grocery store in her home, and this gives her a further source of income to help with the family expenses. \r\n\r\nEva wants to be able to help her family have more financial income. She therefore helps in her neighborhood by taking various local children to school, and this gives her additional income. She also saw that some of her neighbors were requesting help to look after their children. As a result, Eva now also works in the evenings looking after children, and this has given her a little more income which she uses to help her family. \r\n\r\nEva has always looked for a way to keep herself active and productive. This is why she now wants to invest in her small grocery store, as she wants to expand her business and keep her customers satisfied. She has therefore requested a loan, so that she can buy more merchandise and stock her store well.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1191395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Piedras Negras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28.7 -100.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4358.17,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":231.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":249.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":269.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":290.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":313.4},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":338.04},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":364.62},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":393.28},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":424.21},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":457.56},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":493.53},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":532.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.06},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.63},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.14},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.07},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.74},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.59,"local_amount":231.53,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":241.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315366303,"comment":null},{"amount":20.06,"local_amount":249.74,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":260.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322975375,"comment":null},{"amount":44.97,"local_amount":559.92,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":583.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332843515,"comment":null},{"amount":25.17,"local_amount":313.4,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-19T08:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":326.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347054400,"comment":null},{"amount":27.14,"local_amount":338.04,"processed_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-25T08:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":352.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356484298,"comment":null},{"amount":29.29,"local_amount":364.62,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T10:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":380.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364508533,"comment":null},{"amount":31.58,"local_amount":393.28,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":409.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372913827,"comment":null},{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":881.77,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":919.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381691546,"comment":null},{"amount":39.64,"local_amount":493.53,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":514.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399803412,"comment":null},{"amount":42.75,"local_amount":532.34,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":554.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410079547,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T21:57:00Z","paid_date":"2013-10-17T12:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":472378,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is married with five children, and only four of her children go to school.

Her earnings were a big help for her children\u2019s education, and for their personal, household and business expenditures. \r\n\r\nShe would like to apply for a 16,000 PHP loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. The more items displayed at the store the better. More items to sell will result in better profit. Her profits from the business will definitely help to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and the children\u2019s education expenses. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. \r\n\r\nMylene dreams of being able to see her child graduate from college. She also dreams of expanding her business someday and making it a grocery store. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":1048210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay

After much thought about how to support his family so his children wouldn't go hungry, Inhomjon decided to sell his only dairy cow and to apply for a loan from our organization.  With this money, he bought a car - an Opel Astra - and he currently works as a taxi driver.  At first, the work was very tiring, but he now finds that it suits him.  His family's financial situation has improved greatly since last year.  Inhomjon has borrowed from our organization for many years and has good credit history.  He is asking for a loan of 6,000 somons, with which he plans to repair his car.

In the past, she has worked as a baker and a seamstress.  She has always been interested in hair-styling, though, and finally decided to take a hair-styling course.  She subsequently started her own beauty salon, a business that she operates from a space in her house.

Among them we have selling fruit, selling traditional skirts, selling blankets, selling blankets, and selling bed covers.\r\n\r\nThe loan they will take will benefit small businesswomen like Martha.  She has been a member of Pro Mjuer for three years, and she joined by invitation from a promoter of the institution who visited her at home.  She currently has a business selling traditional skirts.  She says that she undertook this business by recommendation from her cousin who taught her how to make them.  Later she became involved in doing the same.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will now take is to increase materials (to buy fabric) that she will get at the fairs in the city of El Alto.

The members of the community association operate a variety of businesses, including the following: a neighborhood store; clothing sales; gift sales; sewing skirts; and a call center.  The loan they are requesting will benefit small microbusiness owners including Estefa.  She says that she has belonged to Pro Mujer for four years, after being invited by a friend who is a member of the organization.  She now has a call center business, the same one that she started twenty years ago at the suggestion of her in-laws and her husband.

They purchased it three years ago and live there with their little son Daniel, who is four years old. They want to provide him with a good future. Gladys and her partner work growing coffee plants. They have been farming their own land for seven years and inherited the plots from family.\r\n \r\nDuring the harvest season she gets help from laborers so that they can finish harvesting. They later take the product to the distribution centers for sale, which are located one hour away from the community where she lives. She is well compensated for the sacks of coffee she sells there. However, transporting them is very hard for her, since there aren't very many vehicles in transit in her community and her partner has to carry them up to a certain point, but even that doesn't prevent her from continuing with her work.

She will use the 2,000 new soles to buy lumber to make furniture.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":1193302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-09-19T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-10-19T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373529117,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-09-19T22:22:34Z","paid_date":"2013-06-20T09:19:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":471556,"name":"Leyda Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Leyda Mar\u00eda  trabaja  en un colegio de la Ciudad de Le\u00f3n desempe\u00f1ando el cargo de docente  Leyla Mar\u00eda sale de su casa de habitaci\u00f3n 6:30 inicia sus labores 6:45 am  finalizando  a las 12:00 pm  con este mismo horario de lunes a viernes,   Por la tarde  dedica dos hora para la planificaci\u00f3n de la clase del d\u00eda siguiente,  Leyda Mar\u00eda es  madre de dos  hijos de 7 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad. \n\nLeyda  solicita un cr\u00e9dito a Ceprodel  el que  utilizara  para compra de uniforme de su hija que participara en el desfile  de la fiesta patria como integrante de la comparsa r\u00edtmica del colegio en que estudia  y uniforme de su Hijo var\u00f3n que tambi\u00e9n participara en el desfile.","en":"Leyda Mar\u00eda is a young woman who works as a teacher in a school in the city of Le\u00f3n.

He is very happy because both activities are having good results thanks to the good clientele he\u2019s managed to consolidate as time has gone by.  He hopes to continue working like he\u2019s done to date so that later on he can open a carpentry shop or a regional lumber sales business.\r\n\r\nThis is MFP loan #17.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of financial resources, he was not able to pursue a university education and has therefore had to fight hard for his children to have better opportunities.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Anastasio's routine is to get up at 4:00am every day to begin his journey to regions that are both nearby and far away to buy live hogs and resell them to butchers who will then sell the meat.  He goes about this activity using a wagon pulled by horses, which he owns.  He travels in the same wagon with the hogs.\r\n\r\nHe needs the financing in order to invest in the purchase of hogs to offer his established and new customers.  Jos\u00e9 Anastasio is grateful to the Kiva investors for their help and opportunities for a dignified life that they offer the small vendors with few resources living in poor countries like Nicaragua.

Mar\u00eda begins working very early, purchasing the various regional fruits like papayas, bananas, oranges and other products which she acquires from the main market in the city where she lives.  She makes her sales out of her home; she has a large table set up where she displays all of the products that she sells for the satisfaction of her customers.  Eventually, she makes jams with the fruits that are very ripe and then she also sells them.  Her home is located in a well traveled area and this allows her to have very good sales on a daily basis.  She has worked over four years at this and she generally works by herself, although sometimes she receives help from her children.  She supplements this business with the sale of soft drinks and ice cream, the profits from which help her to bear the household expenses.  She enjoys her work because it allows her to complete tasks that don't require great effort.  Moreover, it permits her to have the necessary free time in the afternoons to complete other tasks which also provide income.  She hopes to expand her business.  She has the willpower and the desire to be able to supersede her own expectations.  This is her third loan with MFP and she is very happy to know that there exist people who offer financial support that will allow her to be more calm and advance with her business plan.
